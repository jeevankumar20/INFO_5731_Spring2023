alfred hitchcock famously said make great film need three thing script script script convinced james didnt shooting script turned camera filmed motion capture put insane amount cgithe character devoid emotion motive charisma giving personality plank wood empty vessel james use megaphone spread environmental concern honestly make documentary like blue planet call day dozen year case waste much audience time money say thing thats said multiple time much better way looking wallethe story simple predictable yet still couldve worked runtime bee shorter like lot shorter could cut hour half wouldnt make slightest difference term continuity scene ended kept going minute sub plot quality soap operaand last dialogue movie day dont seem care good dialogue sadly audience dont seem care either dialogue firstly importantly interesting exposition escalation driving plot forward useless instrument audience isnt invested character saying whole movie feel like written pretentious art student knowledge interactive speaking work also doesnt help actor terrible delivering line without emotion charisma sound like character bad video game
watched movie imax one best cinematic experience long time movie look absolutely stunning time couldnt tell cgi wasnt thats real look every piece scenery something admire visuals might groundbreaking back still best seen movie cameron expertly crafted world immerse ini also enjoyed story following formular seen first one er could recognize story piece medium new character great well really enjoyed exploring world end movie also became obvious still movie go doesnt quite feel like conclusion solution set upi dont know better first movie see cinematic event want watch movie watch theater watching home give full experience trust
movie defintely worth watch visuals movie absolutely stunning much actually tend forget incredible watching since masterfully done throughouti rewatched first avatar day went see one even though obvious change made story universe isnt done much consequense overall experience good therethe real criticism give regarding storyplot lack thereof first movie extremely simple unoriginal story least one avatar way water seamingly plot considerable storyline set mainly show visual superiority make seem bit hollow naturally shame still recommend movie visuals delightful reunion universe pandora
say worth seeing movie big screen visually magnificent couldnt take eye watching possibly best movie ever seen visually come butbut movie excels visually come short storyplot felt bit repetitive similar way first avatar movieit felt james camerons main focus making near perfect movie visually unfortunately negative impact plot overall gave movie real unbalanced feel hope avatar bring stronger storyplot make unpredictable enjoyableone final point make feel need sigourney weaver play voice daughter still child everytime spoke didnt come across right child talking like year old woman benefit get seriously strange decision female child character cast child actress simple
biggest thing came movie story worried exactly would continue story naturally keep audience interested well think story able also still think mightve needed edits make bit better enjoyed family element movie obviously first movie one inevitable jake neytiri would family really enjoyed getting see connected family showing different dynamic well felt like real family sibling would stand one second next make fun due many new character movie important thing balance movie new character introduce audience build connection important give enough time develop show dynamic character although would love say movie good job balancing character cant say fully come kid character particular story good job spending time depending important come character movie time forgot even existed due little screen time get see movie jake neytiri werent shown much one character particular surprised didnt get much screen timespider played jack champion despite interesting character didnt get much screen time disappointing much potential really interesting character study end forgotten along way wasnt new character tossed side also lot metkayinas also pushed side feel like came pushing character side primarily affected water tribe none character fully fleshed many ended flat character really hope future movie get screen time proper static character think biggest reason character arent part sully family get pushed side due part story didnt really enjoy sky people returning im returning kind figured going return choose return particular decided quaritch played stephen lang return big bad movie applaud movie actually addressing possible despite making zero sense wish created new bad guy movie wasnt problem sky people storyline didnt feel fully thought two different storyline going sky people one randomly forgotten one literally appearing nowhere see idea wish adjusted bit make bit interesting also time movie feel like come screeching halt overall pacing movie surprisingly well done didnt notice much time passed one biggest concern threehourlong run time thinking going scene couldve cut shortened partially correctfor part never felt like movie dragging moving decent pace especially opening scene reintroduced character sully family start feel pacing issue sky people return family go pandora reef point movie started find scene couldve cut cut find funniest thing though movie despite everything flowing well ending movie rushed ending best described dont blink youll miss due fast go think real biggest reason dont notice much time passed due special effect movie despite many year passed since first avatar movie came there one thing everybody agree special effect aged super well specifically love compare motion capture first movie one sure see difference cgi navi creature pandora everything look much cleaner natural especially true come look creature pandora getting properly explore reef pandora get see new creature mainly inhabit ocean im asking ride ilu skimwing tulkun welldesigned creature look incredible people creature jawdropping environment pandora well weve already seen forest pandora look like exciting getting see whole area gorgeous every scene thats underwater breathtaking make wish could go visit place definitely huge round applause every single special effect crew person hard work creating underwater creature environment navi people course without actor motion capture suit none would work outi cant say acting movie best say kid movie really stole show teenage actor movie first big movie role really doesnt show able convey proper emotion thats needed scene make character stand amongst others sibling able likely relate one sulley sibling due well demonstrate different kind sibling everybody person surprise trinity joli bliss play tuk expected tuk cliche annoying little sibling actually fun watch say youngest relate person related really enjoyed watching loak portrayed britain dalton sully kid loak honestly interesting watch due part britain dalton portrayal character conveyed perfectly kid who trying best fit others family still true always stand belief despite everything always sibling protect anything despite much screen time another actor surprised jack champion like said earlier spider interesting character study he human raised among navi feel like screen time jack champion could really bring much character make fan favourite remember looking cast list seeing sigourney weaver play kiri coming back movie curious see well sigourney weaver incredible job playing teenage daughter grace know part cgi looked completely different still couldnt tell playing character thought brought young actress motion capture voice work nosigourney weaver actually played kiri physicality vocal tell put effort come across regular teenage actor voice body posture conveys emotion well quickly say despite lot screen time zoe saldana also pretty good every time zoe saldana screen saw neytiris character growth past year becoming mother changed shes super supportive family want whats best also brings raw emotion character well youre hypnotized performance everybody else movie also pretty good due many getting much screen time couldnt fully show acting ability last thing want mention editing movie weird part editing movie fine occasion editing weird there one scene one thing happening randomly cut something else related couple second cutting back original thing moment taken movie experience decently confused end avatar way water surprised also proved right still issue story movie definitely worth seeing least whatever specialized screen local theatre special effect alone im curious see happen avatar
cgi underwater scene excellent perfectionism something cameron finally movie cinema make sense completely new experience new standard coming movie future innovation qualifies top ratinghowever story predictable quite boring film intended broad audience banal simplified message pocahontas premature adult cartoon movie hoped something advanced saving whale sustainability general brainier alabama man wont change mind watching movie anyways

first big fan avatar blown away cgi back revolution term cgi movie avatar way water disappoint far go phenomenal probably beautiful movie ever seen detail remarkable felt surreal experiencing dbut cameron forget spend time plot seems like spend time cgi reused plot avatar sky people returned want populate earth guess main villain colonel quaritch course resurrects new blue version determined get revenge motivation throughout whole movie track jake sully kill matter immortal dy might well make new avatar himonce jake must learn adapt new way life case reef people time big family eg two brother impossible distinguish introduced big resource movie stuff brain tulkun stop ageing process unobtanium vol reef people hear killing tulkuns decide participate war quaritch sky people great job fighting people boat sudden reef people gone suddenly jake neytiri kid apparently reef people went home seems like huge plot hole since jake could easily defeat quaritch rest men reef people stayed foughti liked fighting scene jake quaritch maybe little long great suspense end fight avatar rescued eywa spider fun character decides save quaritch even though experienced horrible immediately go sully family hug jake part group make sense love family much save colonel tried kill seems hard writer come new villain following movie keep alive big question also villain avatar short plot similar avatar quite plot hole however visual part movie insane must watch cinema
astonishingly beautiful watch far better avatar specially sea stuff kudos cameron thatspoiler alert time sequel known pretty much similar original cant believe even reciled villain sounded lazy let copy paste story add sea bit titanic loss family member dont get wrong loved watching specially imax could hardly believe eye beautiful really frustrating felt like waste time money spend hour basically story screen even hate towards human oops whole manicheism mankind mean sky people bad want use earth mean pandora natural resource feel kinda stupidthere many way show mankind overly using earth natural resource making binary good v bad story actually doesnt help people wont reflect itanyway ill likely watch visuals want nice story though stick st hope one doesnt make much money st id hate pay visuals even worse story
dont understand movie epic proportion exorbitant amount financing fails greatly storytellinghow get overlookedthe writing dialogue cringe cringe cringei almost threw mouth timesyes scenery beautiful special effect quote unquote world care deep connection character get boring real fastit snooze fest yes pricey nap screeningso unfortunatewhy big name director get lazy maybe wrapped big toysso disappointingkate winslet ronal despite brilliant always still didnt feel character absolute barometersome acting though cringe melodramatic disconnectedthis given visuals
everything looked similar last movie cgi animation dialogue action sequence literally copy pasted first movie zero originality clear james cameron cash standard even terminator widely praised audience wasnt really good terminator easy see rehash wasnt goodthis movie didnt really need sequel first ended well sequel would human coming back force annihilating navi happened instead seeing new human force attack navi basically got revengewhale hunt plot quaritch subplot needed ended last film he reduced cartoonish villain im even kidding first movie quaritch company man looking profit expense native free reign go jake sully expense earth employer wutwe know james camerons obsession deep sea submersible diving painful see shoehorn avatar story unbelievable way dont want make spoiler end movie left bad taste mouth writing wasnt good movieplease wait streaming worth watching theater trust

watched first avatar many time huge anticipation one honestly surprised sad contrast first one also sad moment still quite upbeat tone ended victory note one hard enjoy fully overall quite emotionally draining necessarily bad thing modern movie completely emotionally sterile personally stoic person even barely held together end woman around wiping tear glass brutalin regard world buildup cinematography action scene usual james cameron delivers overdelivers wish indepth self exploration feeling main character little poetic selfobservation jake sully go first movie emotion reaction mostly basic primal response happening much fear anger uncertainty also little wonderful personality neytiry one pushed close primal instinct emotion think shouldve quiet happy moment contrast ugliness threat coming human invasion barely saw life jake sully pandora first movie scene enough overall feel like first part twopart movie hope next one get released sooner dont wait year

used confess mr camerons biggest fan sentiment ended way water way water good story latest installment avatar reminds poor sequel followed terminator sure mr cameron actually took part movie production one thing sure missing james cameron touch fell love year thought provoking dialogue decision made villain completely unrealistic scene dilogue disjointed ending titanic remade infact whole movie remake st one maritime perspective character like stupid boy spider completely stupid spirituality st installment replaced cursing urban gesturing father relationship dont make sense could go bottom line movie big disappointment worthy wasting time money

basically retelling first movie jake sully kid neytiri u marine still attacking pandora made look like nazi water navi live ocean could made look cooler lighter blue skin tone even sea creature look bland coloranother thing bother movie navi use marine weapon thought navi using kind weaponry doesnt jive belief apparently war monger like marinesthis movie extremely boring way long hour james cameron never made train wreck trying compete star war star trek completely missed mark force wasnt made thisedit effect groundbreaking average compared cgi effect shouldnt make movie story character also everything take place planet extremely boring least star war star trek multiple planet specie shown james cameron trying make buck couldnt care le storytelling character development obvious anyone isnt completely brainwashed special effect

left wanting even though control p interval break multiplex witnessing cinematic marvel believe extra adrenaline rushing action sequence last hour making somehow uncomfortable funny way 😂😂😂yes hour lengthy run time year wait james cameron knew nothing le would justice fan first part dont think adding anything new say cinematic masterpiece real world may start look little dull even living kashmir lot said every word praise coming anybody well deserved onehowever feel version could little better expecting arrow shot neytri flying screen hitting invader something enjoyed first part yes rain spectacular diving sessionthis sequel revenge hurt ego thrashed invader kind expecting kind storytelling anything different would looked completely hook although little predictable completely thrilling definitely leave wanting
read somewhere james cameron best director come visuals technique well seeing avatar di say amazing beautiful movie ever seeni wonder people see since ish peep looking imax theater movie meant watched dstory wellokit goodyes good imo good original avatar movieone story something building lucky see movie iti wait let build likingthis bit light forseeable go plotwise good stillwhat come tech visuals effectsthat alone would give movie like point possiblewere navis one invented navigator reptile life pandoratip drop imax etcgo watch promise wont regretthis one need seen glass amen
vfx story length movieinitial part go thru well sometimes start dragging endlessly many people movie theater seen moving around sometime particularly interval predictable world flying vehicle technologygunsfire everything look amazing vfxits big torture sit watch movie sometime becomes predictable length movie big let downmovie ticket movie exorbitantly high surprise collected much money box office
movie dumb enjoyable actually think story little stronger first movie although pretty painfully obvious james cameron dragged setting area he comfortable underwater he pulled tool bag liberally using aspect abyss titanic alien deep etcno complaint casting really character least depth believability although character plot induced stupidity one particular one telegraphed quite earned guess interaction character question scripted cute due long running timeonly saw going see imax xmas might end mindblowing like first one visually
great movie bit long thoroughly enjoyed visuals stunning course particularly enjoyed watching sully family adapting new environment even seeing inspiration maori culture water people cool see awe whole time felt though could relate kiri sense overwhelmed beauty environment highly regarded ecosystem pandorahowever even though know film isnt real cruelty shown movie felt bit real really disturbed doesnt impact rate film people really cannot watch film animal cruelty distressed environmental harm say hard watch time still recommend though
avatar way water build cameron successfully deployed first film incredible visuals mediocre plot tag along behindthis film essentially film three time first act kid end captured saved happens second last act wellthe design native naavi incredible creature fantastic even seem thought evolution animal clearly shared similar natural lineage detail design make avatar film popular however also design choice film kiri teenager film adopted jake neytiri kiri somehow fatherless child sigourney weaver character first film dr grace naturally choose play kiri however weaver isnt teenager real life actually happens year old woman naturally deep voice didnt work although liked kiri character weaver performance really jarred mealso character spider awful actorapart great watch
long awaited sequel highest grossing film time finally arrived great saw film imax one best overwhelming experience ever everything james cameron first film technically whole different caliber primary issue one original avatar story bad surface level im saying story complex come film clear case style substance avatar way water absolutely worth wait hopefully take james cameron long make next one
okay much waiting disappointed certainly image beautiful make animated film actor film still supporting human make differencethe storyline isflat best lot inconsistency train attack dont know came going since human base train carrying weapon aircraft cockpit cross arrow attacker around thirty big battle flying fish disappear fight middle child constantly disobedient middle fight without scratch except one dy make said lot story hole inconsistency year feel like script done three day there nothing attachment character even jack coward good family man im even talking writer bringing back bad colonel introducing son sigourneys daughter clone surviving second filmin short apart computergenerated image longer represent tour de force today since film becomes indigestible prefer forget number following one dont think success bad
avatar way water james cameron prof he best action director film innovator one still relevant year amazing film makingvisually movie stunning manages innovate cgi flawless especially considering difficulty everything involving water entire moviei really like sigourney weaver young character probably favorite character way cameron found good way bring back character died first moviei would say weakest point movie plot partially rehash first movie running time dont feel like watching movie hour long still bit shorter final battle felt like dragging bit muchthis movie easily win academy award visual effect there justice give cameron oscar direction taken first moviei watched movie stunning couldnt tell part changed hfr flawlessi give movie visuals rest go watch big screen hfr

say excited movie understatement although first avatar massively popular released time people critical film opinion never really changed avatar isnt greatest movie ever certainly worst deserves credit pocahontas blue people cant say sequel truly disappointmentwe left first movie quaritch dead military expelled pandora jake permanently transferred avatar body sequel couldve gone many route instead james cameron chooses probably least imaginative path travel year pas quaritch back conveniently avatar form hellbent vengeance jake sully nothing else motivates action even matter quaritch dad side note jake sole focus he happy spend fair bit military resource get revengemeanwhile jake playing family man leader clan facing arrival new human militia pandora hears quaritch back decides escape sea different navi clan resides follows almost three hour following sully family sea mostly gorgeous visuals empty storytelling plot point clearly setup many sequel already work jakes adopted daughter inexplicable power son befriends basically whale movie spends fair bit time showing viewer hunting animal badnot jake reflect fact human movie never discus internal conflict may arise since jake fighting human part relationship neytiri also barely visited zoe saldana criminally underutilised reduced simply shouting cry majority linesthe movie forgets human v navi conflict doubt happening forest area pandora glaze fact there new resource town coveted power make human immortal genuinely mentioned throwaway comment instead stuck fight jake quaritch build lacklustre finale make realise smallscale movie even mil budgetwhilst shot truly beautiful three hour sea youll likely wish back forest experiencing weird wacky wonder filmmaker previously thought pandoraall movie worth wait itll long time watch james camerons name likely would rated much lowerthe master sequel dropped ball here hoping next sequel better

come james cameron bar definitely high make easy disappoint way im saying avatar terrible movie however mediocre experienceto sum terribly boring villain nothing better story overall kinda feel like recycled time often nothing made interested part three even great water visuals didnt change meand yes enjoyed first avatar wouldnt say mindblowing story worked well new time amazing probably still hold wellthe sequel hand seemed cameron interested depicting live water everything around kind felt like mixing together various story character idea previous moviesalso im fan mixing fps fps movie lot computer animation feel lot like video game day visually improved lot past year dont get wrong water segment movie visually amazing aside fps matter taste course alone wasnt enough enjoy movie long would preferred shorter compact movie caseso yeah difficult recommend movie younger audience might work better able fully enjoy experience dont get hung storytelling still think one camerons weakest movie narrative level

storyline extremely shallow predictable actually wasnt even real story honest dialogue empty sounded like written teenager character one dimensional acted way would make feel frustrated couldnt help roll eye good thing film visual effect even got oldboring pretty everything looked element novelty surprise hour way long considering zero development story charactersi watched imax felt like waste time money several part almost fell asleep

great experience cgi stunning honestly plot wasnt even terrible flaw overall worked well imo movie felt like bridge third movie acted mainly device build expand pandora rather telling brand new story theme well explored touching topic like animism gnosticism reflecting real world environmental issue human created earth fascination adoration nature spiritual connection beautifully portrayed came ocean soul eventually return death
scorsese right movie like cinema exactly something else buy ticket seat move action something else like imagine interactive novel surround sound ambient sound effect piped scent match readits longer literature something elsethis ride sensory experience cinema feel like long disneyworld attraction movie frame rate change distracting alternating smooth soap opera high def video occasionally looking actually filmic realisticunlike say seventh seal godfather story character could adequately summarized sentence two little finer resolution required one could make argument first star war supposebut telling simple story epic way doesnt necessarily diminish piece case story character much archetype star war thin shallow perfunctory generic ultimately devoid necessary compelling relatabilitystar war thin sure archetype story classic universal somehow relatable human way avatar isntthis ride without moving seat though certainly worth price admission lasting effect precisely long deep feeling one left exiting disney attraction fun last evaporates get line next ride

unpopular opinion easily worst james cameron movie recent memory me😂 pretty animation visual spectacle sure unbelievably bloated littered questionable choice enjoy movie would require one throw logic window despite long runtime coherent plot character development still virtually nonexistentwhen said done hour life never get backon positive note come dvd id definitely recommend playing background house party drink every time one kid say bro youre gonna lot fun passing drunk time movie youre welcome 😁

like many went high expectation given wonderful first movie bar set pretty high ill keep short sweet avoid giving sort spoiler opinion breathtaking storyline scenerycgi character old new everything gelled theme pertinent relevant current world issueschallenges perhaps thats pack emotional punch im glad took time show amazing cinema dont rush much stuff rushed studio cash another testament good movie wife didnt glance phone whole three hour

loud common reaction heard leaving cinema auditorium fellow viewer wow didnt feel long fact almost quick considering fact movie mean quick big testimony riveting captivating movie plot visuals combined im saying beginning review wont discussing visuals simply cant add thing whats said alreadythe point want make regard plot much better reviewer claim character heard say movie much like first installment people saying spoke fault simply outcome single story continued first installment think another chapter read book dont expect every chapter turn story upsidedown fact youd complaining would case thing cameron already done installment terminator ii see two realize single movie separated two chapter thats reason cameron didnt want anything rd installment terminator went point story making make destiny strong enough dont know yet whats point time im sure weve seen end story im definitely going wait watch next installment create amazing complete world mind always love artist creates entire world storyas character created movie unlike first one significant character left undeveloped could use substance obviously movie would end even longer accordingly acting first class though im still uncertain regarding fact sigourney weaver playing year old daughter understand point cameron making flawlessly im still bit uneasy thing movie thing cameron left story spoke little major issue already said movie long enough still detail missing story completely coherent
watched avatar imax year ago thoroughly moved imagery world character story facilitated emotion blind approach went movie real idea took similar approach movie tooi dazzled true imax could bring life visual brilliance movie brought world character life story lacked depthit mostly contained lot platitude family way water whole lot action meaningful underlying message eat eaten certain point felt like fast furious series wondrous landscape pandora could beenvisually stunning kudos people made happen fire writer twice essentially dishing meaningless story focused platitude character formation suspenseful twist anything could made movie good first one
thank continuing movie abandoning happening movie take viewer another marvelous field vision hope continue make progress making movie available audience like television anymore want make k k another world film made long focused family able cut lot footage great success focusing taking care aquatic animal ecology destroyed world bad world policy nature follows course already warning u snowfall pole
start ok visuals special effect nothing short amazing however cared visuals stick natural geographic story pretty lame happens isnt really problem script actual telling story whole first half movie summarizing end first movie new story insanely unnecessarythe way wasnt good saying first movie amazing better told better plot nothing really happened fighting started said could see maybe first part bigger story come later like one filler episode tv series good part honestly like filler episode never want rewatch
let honest avatar dance wolf space visuals amazing story terrible predictable isnt better honestly muchvisual spectacle nothing new film today seethe le impact see towering jungle underwater reefsand floating mountain brain becomes numbto whole thing fed cake morning noon night always going get sick eventuallythe whole family angst teen drama junk went minuteshow one recalled event first film completely destroyed tree first one one seems recall thatthe cliche human v navii contrite tired noble savage trope dont enough trope already film tv right nowjames need stop writing film actually suck writing technical side amazing stick thatas critical drinker saidi struggle decide whether recommend film people hour shorter maybe bit smarter nuanced would nobrainer stand even though better almost anything else put disney year long bloated selfindulgent really dont know worth time money early box office result anything go might one
remember completely entranced first avatar ive fan every work cameron released he much storyteller he inventor he paved way many movie effect set standard hollywood elite lately never hope meet im glad finally able release second movie since movie industry crisis consistently faced mediocre work mostly bad sequel original content cameron worked miracle amount detail effort put avatar mind blowing hear lot steam whiner internet blast havent even seen fool cameron doesnt direct steer put blood sweat tear every project he greatest filmmaker ever lived truly hope get content year im really looking forward sequelsand side note love sigourney weaver favorite actress incorporated back movie fantastic
avatar one would think three hour violent war film whaling whaling scene unnecessary harpooning mother whale calf following whale dead calf seen nudging dead mother film distasteful disturbing ridiculous visual stunning thats avatar already filmed set released anything like sincerely hope cameron reconsiders tone need pulled exactly take three year make
visuals great often time videogameisque otherwise story shallow childishcant wrap head around important part werent given enough importance yeah leave forest tribe save as let send someone earth chase single guy space reason etc yet hour spent showing unnecessary visuals character boring dont feel bonding dialogue childish dont give feeling good writing get boring often time thingsanother annoying part hfr seemed coming going wasnt present whole movie make difficult get used hfr cinema fpstbh disappointment except nice visuals
goodness even though went movie without expectation really bad first two half hour boooooooooing silly none sense talk finally get last minute pure stupid action story begin unless want consider revenge main plot story basically point whole movie felt like watching soap opera blue people furthermore every scene predicable silly dialogue cant say much acting whole movie visual affect even action scene silly lame bottom line dont waste neither money time
basic story line ive seen little addition first movie standard miller american family blue face paint special effect good movie lacked creativity would recommend watching thisit lacked alien feel exploration new world new technology new science first movie sure wait needed better story worse cgi etc would much better everything need blockbuster budget blockbuster hopefully making another ilk

really hate say plot ruined experience could great movie creating stunning visuals showing create throw absurd amount money vfx doesnt make good moviefor show visual effect stunning groundbreaking may online play supporting role storytelling making main element movie result least underwhelming experiencewithout story simply get compilation really great super realistic vfx shot stretched minute maybe cameron could planned two sequel instead four focused plot developement much like hobbit movie movie feel like butter put much bread
thing made way water le satisfying original imo first effect disappointing cant remember exactly first second thing focus jarring way like spear arrow tip coming screen looked directly instead character face looked multiple place looked somewhere focal point screen thing looked badsecond quite bit spoon feeding dialogue defeating purpose avatar joining able talk directly sea creaturesthirdly rare material switch also surprisingly low value funny like maybe million massive amount movie started production youd need kill thousand whale get billion seems tall orderfinally whole story end worse position first avatar send human packing time theyve partially defeated old villain backup generally think new villain wouldve better lot thing couldve cut without affecting plot like relationship whale already established empathy nature first
except dont imagine happening everyday one care let little something world better place sureand let kill earth save earth save humanity take away got amazingly well done filmbeautiful visual touching story marvelous technology deep thoughtful message alarming warning let give hand jamesi almost cried felt guilty anything stop current way trading nature film everyone watch old young maybe one day unite earth nature
movie satisfies expectation far visual beauty movie lively filmed directly fandora felt like watching natural documentary animal movement natural making seem like took picture actual animal long wait worth however regret noticeable abroad element also disadvantage movie unnecessarily long development delayed much defending audience boring also really regrettable narrative plot simple enough write one line confrontation structure also simpler previous oneand middle movie mentioned migration goal human focusing peripheral content definitely prepared followuplets keep eye

ok movie really isnt good super bored entire time none character interesting intriguing plot huge retread original even visuals minus background giant eye sore watching weird stretchy looking blue ice age baby hyper realistic yet wholly unsettling uncanny facial expression constantly calling bro super hilarious thing constantly scratching scalp lack context jungle boy origin sigourney weaver child better yet sigourney weaver playing teenager im scared there going count em people three thingsgood lordd

empty empty movie truly letdown magic meaning avatar gone beauty avatar feeling wild authentic living interconnected nature community real bonding real value avatar lowconsciousness opposite brave highideal vision original avatar honestly nothing take avatar thing blowing event meant nothing completely unnecessary conversation real advanced ethic nothing inspiring fact felt like assault energy first avatar world touched uplifted u severely downgraded unoriginal mundane pitiful version human character relationship communal living shame
personally really enjoyed avatar whilst story wasnt original made good cast great vfx movie stain movie james camerons career wholethe action scene way fast like audience supposed attention span haddock throughout movie special effect laughably lowquality felt like watching cutscene cheap xbox gamethe story moderately original time character unlikeable including jake sully came unbearable jerk gave film star character wasnt cocky arrogant annoying sigourney weaver kiri pretty decent subplot one character likedmy opinion save cash rent first one amazon
movie plot terrible took year make movie come nobody noticed mediocre story movie basically director saying look put together best cgi visuals hollywood offer everything look prettier movie must masterpiece stop caring character min movie keep looking watch wondering much time left could go understand director ending hour movie scene essential overall story thats case would cut whole hour movie
well half hour beautifully done scene actually felt like swimmingsailing rough seasand hour half dozen regurgitated storyline got thrown together large dose greed bad pitched good measure one dimensional plot lot hissingyellingand whale tattoo add another character finish review sully stick together unless monster inc he colour sully movie maybei like new lightweight exoskeleton though unless used drink cup coffee trying show u awesome guess

maximum credit film go james cameron way film go mesmerizing initially movie time looked lengthy watching felt hungry way sir james creates movie well known either terminator series titanic legendary movie movie based present time past need research fantasy genre need imagination avatar way one imago different planet various creature really remarkable way bad side humanity shown really worth future concept machine craft sub really well shown vfx shown doesnt look like vfx look like real really waiting next part
wonder sequel always darker violent outstanding visual effect dont compensate lack consistent plot better far west fiftees clan bandit bully peaceful village course together become hero heavy price last thirty minute cloned titanic adding orgy violence opening door new sequel since awful baddy leaf alive wouldnt recommend younger audience mention child specially keeping mind film premiered christmas family consumption
yesterday went cinema watch avatar way water great time popcorn delicious sadly movie entertain really teenager would say guess priority make money possible mm movie poor story line bad script always surprise american blockbuster couldnt hire writer actually write deep meaningful story also character flat onedimensional impossible care actually annoying pity movie battle movie national geographic invented animal coolest part movie beautiful cinematography story line missed opportunity overall point special effect point music point cinematography point invented animal point fun watching movie cinema child
janes cameron literally wrote heart screenplay taking vfx everythings top notch kudos effort team must watcheverybodys role well defined honestlyi expected action sequence jack sully water fight lasting around minute flew although lag scene sky people enter sea territory movie never cease surprise u hardwork vfx artist u reflected every part moviethere also lot family value shown movie hence child also learn suit people age groupquartichs face look way similar sully made meaner different isnt post credit scene iteagerly waiting rd part
thought cameron better fake review think one still awake theatr movie ended entire act wasted fruitless world building neytiri exists purely plot device jakes wife jake boring carry story avatar jake sully kid get antic physic decide want exist many question answer version looked bad like watching videogame cutscenes expected least improvement cg department year zero cameron given jumped shark
boring narrative nothing new fresh movie copy hundred similar movie copy first avatar yes graphic look excellent decent level sometimes character moved angular look plastic first avatar distinguished excellent music accompanying film second avatar unfortunately cannot boast general film complete disappointment pleasant moment movie beautiful location character act perhaps end advantage movie
sure get high rating far long first hour might aswell happened slow boring idea going get little better storyline poor hadnt watched probably would walked cinema first time ever film could easily made hour even kid agreed clue going first hour maybe get good review aspect never watch wouldnt bother watching great film
extremely disappointed sequel avatar first film groundbreaking visually stunning achievement avatar fall flat every aspectit clear james cameron interested showcasing cgi skill crafting compelling wellwritten story plot weak unoriginal shallow character predictable plot point acting wooden unconvincing dialogue cringeworthyi extremely frustrated camerons obsession cgi substance special effect impressive cannot save film numerous flaw clear prioritized visual spectacle storytelling result shallow unengaging filmfurthermore film runtime excessive indulgent scene dragging far long found checking watch multiple time film eager tedious painful viewing experience would recommend anyoneunfortunately avatar huge disappointment clear example style substance prime example james camerons ego lack storytelling ability would strongly discourage anyone wasting time money film
avatar way water reminiscent video game term visuals film also completely convoluted confusing story many point film reminded final fantasy game whose story often confusing often forgettable impress breathtaking vista image stirring emotional moment epic action scene avatar offer samejames cameron tried weave many idea character film first part told simple archaic story heavily criticized seem tried make plot complex multilayered didnt really succeed maybe also many screenwriter worked story besides cameron everyone wanted bring idea filmultimately lot idea thrown film arent really explored thought many element brought never mentioned relevant also many character seem interesting dont really room develop story remain background without u really getting know perhaps well wait sequel dramaturgy often convoluted example main antagonist disappears screen almost hour story take completely different pace feel suddenly drop back story beginning third act especially reminded feeling game like final fantasy x final fantasy xv comparability ff x also given water theme spiritual aspect also plot invents way many element dont fit saw first part bring certain character back story james cameron liked work certain actor also find certain aspect story dont fit spirituality navi got know first partbut still film work emotional level relationship jakes family spiritual connection animal planet especially surprising emotionality antagonist worked design pandora ocean creature fantastic still unique first part visual effect indescribably beautiful last hour insane hour excellent action typical james cameron style overall thought avatar way water good movie mainly visuals little emotional moment crazy action basically much different first part however part much focused thought opinion dramaturgy much structured character stronger
first movie sucked great story couldnt wait see sequel sadly sitting waiting thinking movie way long wrote kid dumb thing make movie take even longer mostly non stop action film story line stunning visuals recommend seeing taint memory originalspider save dad end going limb make third way long story line action film great visuals sequel sequel
think film think suck decision making follows zero logic winning gorilla insurgency impenetrable stronghold flee safety colonel keep threatening hell kill sully kid attempt lure wouldve killed em guarantee jake sully would persue awful film wont seeing star expected james cameron perhaps overly critical dont think im adding last couple sentence fulfill character requirement post review
watching first avatar movie stunned everything perfect watched movie hundred time expectation highthe visual movie fantastic seems real great experience visually overwhelmed visual effectsthe story missing seems like common story predictable scene elongated boring seems like watching discovery channel cinemamy personal rating movie visualisation pandora water animal water may movie would give got lot finest movie jam cameroon one talented director time expect something better

avatar way water meant triumphant return james cameron proof avatar cultural milestone promise doesnt change anything intriguing subplots basically first movie new setting idea cameron spent last decade development movie script still shallow dialogue still cringey overall quality visual effect somehow step first film said payakan g exile great injustice give way water middling disappointment sure end day dont think cameron could make truly bad film triedqyrosmovies
ill admit cgi improvement past decade dont make good movie term scripting acting overall message avatar keep reiterating old stereotype nature good white man bad blue green virtually color specie size innocent friendly make white people ugly greed lack empathy follow rest consequence along flat script flat character minor parentage issue x child creates conflict heard beforethe movie long cgi cost seem come thing could explain vigorously minute run hour iterating ad nauseam fast camera movement detail mar sense realism participationwarning plan watch movie dx theater prepared sail small boat heavy storm three hour watching avatar dx theater worst experience ive ever movie theater problem seen top gun made worse multiplied continuous violent movement seat make impossible maintain upright position halfway movie youll probably start wishing character white blue green people alike dead end credit start rolling virtually every person ended feeling dizzy way real tortureand despite cgi improvement still feel watching colorful silly tom jerry cartoon
ive seen original many time movie seemed reuse anything everything made original film special seriously hoping see something made film stand apart dont get wrong though film beautiful really show far technology come past decade got point didnt care needed go restroom film knew wouldnt missing something hadnt seen guess expectation little high unfortunately expect trend continue future avatar movie
visuals gorgeous expected lot detail great motion chase sequence plot decent taken long develop probably cut hour film still decent movie seemed like mix bunch movie seen nothing really amazing visuals yes nice new character creature landscape also felt much like video game time really bored wanted walk could gone straight streaming would enjoyed much maybe really worth money wait

visually stunning cash grab garbage wish made movie much effort put script cgi extravaganzastill worth watching imax take away youre left generic unnecessary long nonsense plot bright side appreciate music scorebut must admit best thing watching new avatar really called avatar way crap seeing exclusive trailer new mission impossible movie di liked first one movie cliche packed american super production script written appeal broadest possible audience often boil anchored stereotype movie trick youve seen last year hollywood sciptsso summarize visually stunning garbage fun experience ill never rewatch seriously
came home cinema watching would say everyone watch animal planet hd spend time better watching movie soooooo disapointed lack everything story family nothing avatar wouldnt spend single dime movie every episode got better crap saweven jason bourne movie better say alotwe people going cinema every single one come said wow awesome oppersetso save money watch cinema wait atleast come netflix hbo

although visuals movie stunning film felt long lost interest one point additionally plot felt repetitive unoriginal seemed like copypaste first movie discovery new part pandora use fps fps scene also detracted film mixing two frame rate made feel like poorly optimized game overall disappointed movie dont plan seeing next one theater seems like franchise ended first movie filmmaker interested making money
tldr basically load tall blue dude cat tail talking english african tribal accent hissing like cat way much fantasy world backdrop endlong version id recommend anyone hasnt seen movie idea plot device seem freshthe adventure cheesy predictable action scene well sequenced forgive rampant cheese ground family moviethe cgi seemed advanced little since last outting imax thought surprisingly weak underutilized hoping dumbeddown storytelling might least propped stellar disappointing front tooim giving star work clearly went know underappreciated cgi artist must worked tirelessly make asset kind moviesgiven id heard quite bit hype production along line best movie ive ever seen similar high hope experience long way best movie ever really think ever james cameron peaked alien back

decade waiting finally got see visual masterpiece last night sydney say visual thats could say positivefor shortcoming thoroughly enjoyed first film yes dialogue flat uninspired derivative feel landed whole actually cared characterswith way water script character even dumbed point insulting intelligence know cameron want hit quadrant demographic god feel like first pas draft comparison first filmmy biggest issue cant connect character story waaaaaay many character film film spectacular umrimately fails meand film failed hr engagementthe hfr also major complaint keep hfr distracting watching bounce back forth frame per second doesnt work constantly take film actually think hfr work especially didnt get soap opera effectim watching tonight hfr make final judegement screening hopefully know expect maybe enjoy visual ride
absolutely loved thoroughly absorbed richness world honestly didnt want complicated story there way enough sensory information going deal loved perfect escapism dreamlike scifi fair enough everyone one totally enthralled experience there plenty film script story different totally different refreshing experience whole new thing thought heartpounding eyepopping fantasy executed mind bending creativity cant wait next one wish one longer
story make sense painfully long hr half enough constantly overflowing clichés weak cheesy scene dialogue clearly product designed give movie theater something show dx room try watch dx ridiculously annoying could forgiven commercial nonsense side enjoy scenery wasnt completely unnecessary unjustified constant violence towards animal oh need hunting whale much detail make necessary plot display free nonsense violence trashy ridiculous basically movie designed basic spirit enjoy constant action violence sadly know country mostly

year ago avatar stunned world became highestgrossing film time time release remember seeing back story sometimes conventional uniquely immersive theatrical experience genuinely transported viewer another world given much time passed since first one many people raised question whether sequel could deliver visual spectacle telling unique profound story predecessor james camerons technical dedication craft undeniable avatar way water ultimately mixed bagthe film set decade first movie jake neytiri kid villainous colonel first movie reborn recombinant planning attack navi meanwhile jake neytiri embark number adventure oceanside underwater region pandora expected film visually stunning cgi pandora look absolutely exquisite premium large format screen underwater cgi incredibly realistic lifelike every shot look like developed vfx team working absolute highest level film pacing generally fine developing story relishing immersive atmosphere pandora building actionpacked final act however film simply long long running time work well justified density plot story largely retread first movie attempt character development largely pretty shallow seems like entire hour movie could cut bit unfortunate much time cameron didnt end much develop character make engaging interesting said unique blockbuster spectacle technical craftsmanship make avatar still unique experience dolby imax although cant say im super excited third one note saw film dolby cinema dolby vision projection especially light level dolby atmos sound rumble utilized well generally good although found high frame rate scene looked quite jarring

ok yes doubt visually captivating underwater scene sublime nd hour tedious time ive spent cinema though cameron say wanted time explore character given wasnt done st however jump feel rushed film didnt need hr meant accept jakes avatar baby alien thats overlong boring ultimately bland folk arent regular cinema goer flock drove probably enjoy popcorn flick attempt bring emotion end emotionless vast blue pit nothingness oh dont get started villain
really hope last avatar film ever see designed people influence want fun visuals look there substance hell there barely even plot still find way stretch well past hoursthe best movie villain relatable dont side understand coming movie doesnt villain motif forced ive ever seen film exactly first moviethe movie may look good care never understand concept everyone looking exactly exhausting look small detail every single scene work actually talkingthis one long tedious lacking kind story immediately forgettable even found way make jemaine clement boring mustve looked watch hundred time movie swear one point time actually gone backwards generous

year disappointing made year difference effect wasnt worth wait plot bad felt like could made movie hour loved first movie felt like tv version effect wonderful underwater world story long drawn considering much happened cant complain much felt like nature documentary science fiction saw original time theatre feel like wasnt even worth going theatre show worth seeing since
first film well done even better avatar first film badly done even worse sequel first film groundbreaking enthralling cinematic experience term effect doubt film even bigger beautiful breathtaking previous film set perspective compare special effect recent marvel film film see film leap bound ahead ala collection pretty picture story make story first film thin simple enough allowing audience empathise feel jack jack tack backseat introduced many character result audience care jack much writing also painfully average dialogue terribly trite avatar distinguishes vapid blockbuster groundbreaking effect despite lacklustre screenplay riddled inconsistency
really wanted like probably still excited see next one seemed move fast story much move maybe set next movie come visuals conflicting stunning scene really fantastic also handful scene seemed really corny would remind power ranger weird fast forward way like scene used fast speed looked corny cheap fantastic though hope next installment capture heart feeling one

going figured wouldnt wise underestimate james cameron he directed two greatest sequel time alien terminator wondering could pull againthe answer like many reviewer tell strongest point movie visuals story first movie many event happening even dialogue used againbasically inferior version first movie good idea didnt execute well could similar first movie really needed side plot something going especially movie three hour longsince seeing movie really made think terminator terminator similar terminator bigger better almost every way avatar needed bigger better avatar notthe pretty cool moment like right character screen
first movie visually stunning scenery machinery animal large part cgi well done part movie par first avatar cgi returning principal character bit reason especially scene family group often look like former self biggest disappointment story storyline first movie except occurred water instead forest also ending setup avatar much time money done much better

understand great review movie basically first one villain multiple character brought back reason poor new character spider think name spider acting poor pinnacle cringey dialogue film sigourney weaver character bit reach try bring back film movie also ridiculously long fell asleep minute cinema could hear whole cinema getting restless towards end really want see maybe watch home unbearable feel like maybe theyve purchased review get people cinema one near first first one didnt even great story attached new character either certain character kept dumb thing get locked please favour avoid movie save hour life
never fan first avatar movie one bored half sleep clunky acting awkward dialogue within first half hour action sequence involving military exciting jungle water scene really rather dull towards end movie last min wanted end story easily couldve told couple hourshowever willing give movie chance given hype around visual effect beautiful cinematography disappointed effect vibrant point looked cartoony never fully convinced cgi point could ignore landscape epic large scale still feel world emptypoor showing cameron
although visuals time incredible also look like videogame others set fully cgi generated mostly convincing especially several action scene appears practical item essential selling visuals used timesthe main story decent movie contains many filler scene story end feeling thin ending also quite boring unfullfillingcharacterwise neytiri onedimensional character film interesting dynamic jake completely absent also using mile antagonist quite lazy without adding new interesting aspect characterin avatar interesting theme included showing negative side capitalism contained interesting sight spirituality energy human purposeavatar ultimately loses showing incredible visuals feel like maybe could skipped due thin story lack deeper layer
watched dx think mask lot film flaw cant get away fact film look amazing sound like contradiction first minute setting scene felt rushed left wanting backdrop however film felt like would better served hour shorter middle part story bit bland felt unnecessaryi cant help feeling lead sam worthington zoe saldana didnt really come across hero piece almost like supporting character overall im glad ive seen think without dx might scored lower visuals really paper crack plot

especially towards end movie make unnecessary decisionsas saw trailer jake four child cameron doesnt dedicate screentime equally spend time oldest daughter kiri youngest son loak somehow oddly resembles lot like robert pattinson course realize cant help look way audience probably like two think kiri compelling character arc development young shy navi girl difficulty fitting new tribe different see negative kid see freak countless teen relate character try find place big modern worldthe thing bothered villain movie already knew would antagonist last time quaritch coming back think wrong decision good reason returning died first movie even worse final battle avatar loses significance reason find revival quaritch tie main plotin fact plot simple human want revenge banished pandora end last movie come fight jake thats whole story fact good reason continuation story villian lack motivation entire movie wouldnt exist sky people havent returned pandora seek revenge

overwhelmed action sequence hence got bored opposite effect dont believe one feel waythere also abundance aweinspiring action sequence first especially third act film despite felt partly disappointed final battle lacked scope grandeur compared first avatar movie done smaller scale however intended way become personal character necessarily bad thing didnt expect although believe appreciate consecutive viewingsavatar way water excellent movie dont think impactful previous one first movie came league every scififantasy movie term cgi massive leap forward regarding special effect motion capture improvement respect james cameron chose film numerous closeup shot actor wearing motion capture suit bravely demonstrate last five year talented vfx team doesnt shy away see movie trying cover special effect overly dark scene hoping audience wont notice terrible cgi actually isvisually astonishing achievement problem cameron overuse blue color combined purple mean movie limited color palette think saw shade blue movie reminds lot first movie hard distinguish visually one film go underwater appropriate screen explode blue color us color literally every scenei adore decision shoot movie higher frame rate see movement clearly many people dont like since used movie filmed frame per second need time eye get accustomed fps get movie higher frame rate wont notice anything strange quick movement sometimes nowanother essential technical improvement compared movie stunning utilization cant remember last time said movie honestly ive avoided watching film year cameron really know shoot one director seamlessly incorporate technology right way definitely recommend watching course imax theater experience best possible waywhat value film message show u protect preserve marine

james cameron surpassed gigant movie would recommend anyone watch visuals worth seeing least one lifetime crew spent year develop revolutionary underwater motion capture paid besides visuals movie excelled great cast acting performance especially kate winslet zoe saldana sigourney weaver kiri going lie plot left lot desired nothing special simple predictable really need everything else made another thing need highlighted james camerons ability keep good pacing despite exaggerated length movie like titanic first avatar wont notice long take stunning visuals storytelling definitely mustsee
thats hour plus wont get back hopefully there director cut way whilst visuals another planet speak wondered particular order jack rose serious someone stranglehold asphyxiate water bloated dull version free willy set pandora talking whale asking baby another popcorn choking moment first groundbreaking avatar following year thought development result disappointing surely story first series predictable link

avatar brings amazing visual effect table completely entrancing friend viewing regular old reald first avatar back release immense amount detail scene containing water pretty visuals glowing character wildlife mesmerizing said certain scene regarded nearly cringeworthy actor assigned simple reactionary dialogue well plot containing shooting would make stormtrooper scoff thing make wonder truly best cameron could movie worth seeing theater stand test time regarded star movie technology improves cgi longer impressive think
absolute spectacle start finish cant tell otherwise theatre thrill might find boring co took time develop character animal also state thing every environment main character found soon got immersed planet let rip thrill boy always sight behold half thing thought unnecessary eventually played ensure movie despite fantasy highest order played naturally understandable possible nothing short classic infact everything black adam needed monster hit top notch character development

dont get wrong go watch avatar great visuals alone worth however hour leave cinema youll realize forgettable movie isthe plot repeat first movie core silly thats really movie movie mainly family save whale first one protecting forest one saving whale day suffer cruel hunting extinction forgettable story good job keeping entertained pushing core messagethe visuals incredible james cameron finally managed push boundary movie graphic character move accurate human like animation motion capture done since age never degree detail accuracy environment colour lighting beautiful look big problem however format movie suffers regularly judder big distraction poor outcome considering amount work put movie shame james cameron would pick thisthe soundtrack great poorly used movie missed opportunity couldve created really memorably scene taken movie another level used soundtrack betteri really wanted give movie cannot shortfall plot writing faulty visuals judder poor use soundtrack overly lengthy third act
finally year cameron made sequel avatar hoping spectacle like first movie one bit messy wrapped around family issue bad thing noavatar build slowly get way towards second half movie hell break loose war many friend like max trudy augustine avatar driver skinny guy dont remember name mostly gone sequel kind replaced new people sully familyin sequel war begin fast bringing back threath first movie get see sea clan really treat bonding clan water animal delight watchlast part war messy long villain still life dont know three movie coming war villain avatar become bad netflix series please dont stay creative dont deliver trick avatar doomed die like terminator matrix give benefit doubt
avatar body siding along jake neytiris family must understand importance joining clan different navi learning way water need defend new homethe main theme explores outcast learning except good bad peopleanimalsnature different movie viewed variety way avatar wow anyone emotionally involve simplicity story reflecting life want learn breathe underwater appreciate beauty world around never stick together loved onesthe first act move breathtaking pace cannot wait get shore new clan navi called metkayina clan dont want leave time rd act come understand cannot run threat main antagonist time main action set piece film arrives driven character plot builtup filmmaking well personal connection themeswhile may win academy award best script shouldnt type moviegoing experience deserve strong accolade award show worth year waiting film stick around indefinitely annals film history
cameron antihuman lunacy got tiresome quick space whale smarter human compose song write book pathetic stuff reallythis joke movie also many plot hole astounding many time need sully sight actually take shot kill cant though right predictable lacking form suspense gravityone disposable son character finally go took much automatic gunfire marine avatar expended ammo good visuals though aquatic catmen quite disturbing ugly comparison onesthe best thing cast say film avatar steroidssteroids good
impossible replicate astonishment first avatar brought audience thirteen year ago cgi common amongst blockbuster moviesthe film expands world pandora new technology cameron able show audience aspect planet idea water connects everything isnt innovative work well moviehowever antagonist quaritch still need stronger motivation pacing beginning rushed action scene drag long director incorporate beautiful visuals epic action scene like james cameron action sequence epic stunningeven though theme family responsibility suppose big part surface level time finally film doesnt work scene obviously trying make cry seems like cameron interested technology actual story like first avatar film relies visuals rather acting writing still nice experience fall apart certain part
expected budget length produce cgi effect wonderful wish spent time story character development movie turn three hour long showcase team current technology get past visual effect story get stale begin lose interest character appeared lot broll simply important story telling film began lose audience attention roughly halfway noticed quite people getting use washroom character development limited also person perception dialogue never really feel emotionally attached saw movie would recommend format recommendation make film

really long time considered walking movie stunning scene well acted story story different avatar part great creature scenery really need hour fighting conflictand pretty much dont think back part onand something really minor wit director water abyss titanic send greeting quality sequel talk terminator part want see remake let go top gun waste time money

wonderful way spend hour got first viewing new imax cinema fresh pair glass chose best seat direct line sight screen loved storey beginning told life leading present new family dynamic saw first avatar time hopefully try see one many time water scene mesmerising animal creation ocean wave water life loved storey delved pandora mother ewa everything linked cant wait next movie team weta amazing job james cameron really bought u storey
massive avatar fan loved first eagerly awaiting sequel didnt disappoint firstly biggest thing avatar way water beauty pandora forest amazing setting year ago wanted sea first minute switch sea thats film beauty class filming really go notchi found story interesting despite lot character liked invested themthe film hour length went quickly recommend watching cinema like fan first sure love would recommend film anyway amazing
another movie would much better without sequelreally disappointed movie copy previous one different animal environmentthey still tried introduce new feature child villain like avatar insufficient reach level first filmi dont much say film wont see sure unlike previous one ive already seen several time shame hope courage make third one theyll find script worthy film dimension although understand wont easy
good sequel first part come visialisation thats basically nothing new visual effect already seen plot kind empty something missing movie didnt touch one point managed shake bit movie asked like couldnt catch reason step character taking expected make sense personally looked like someone tasked make script didnt watch first part write contain spoiler wont go honestly waited hbo show year wouldnt miss thing dont know cameron already prepares another sequel go like numerous repetition really doubt come story anything new added
didnt make sense birth childhood child minute staying village unnecessary hour lengthy exhausting nothing compare st one jake hero made coward king needed save people selfish result lost son introduced villain early without building story last fight boring expectation high result disappointment high considering overrated movie cgi great missed charm emotion st onebut nd child always deal breaker one realistic
first let start fact sequel cult first part must seen imax repeat mustafter watching imax coming home evening couldnt sleep three hour adrenaline rushits rare ive enjoyed sequel cult blockbuster much morei dont know movie filmed watching imax seems like youre watching something live huge windowthe effect idea film comparison anything done far cinemaif describe continuation avatar two word would rebirth cinema
james cameron strike definitely worth long wait hand easily peak epitome generation cgi truly nothing come close absolutely nailed visuals every way possible hail lord weta digital nailing every possible bit cgi adaptive fps movie really dance buttery smooth brain cell keep switching back forth fps fps truly make whole theatre experience worthy even though runtime pretty big story action justifies dig cannot wait sequel
watched movie loved found start like video game playing character first person quality really good disliked colonel avatar form went created suddenly attacking pandora wished hed loved place rather attack place also neytiris younger son didnt need die enjoyed movie though found start video game completely different first one also sad werent people forest pandora would sort recommend completely different also know probably third one colonel still alive
new movie looked crisp cleaner remembered first movie already best movie time small nitpicking fire movie looked artificial movie pretty long hour runtime honestly didnt feel like reason feel bored weakest part script far original author named surely didnt help also borderline pesky sam worthington rambling family value lot repeat movie paint story greedy corprorates invading paradise like moon movie big concluding movie preparing next movie coming
technical aspect clearest crystal clear best scene ever seen hour full jawdropping moment im still totaly speechless especially waterbased scene lot em stunning soundeffects amazing well honest disappointed scorestory ok good avatar felt like whole movie like part bigger one see fit along upcoming avatar movie according james cameron depends much avatar bring box office let hope enough see onesgive chance enjoy
start perfect water photo well assembled character passion every thing film scream perfection cameron made another blockbuster maybe even surpasses predecessor long way film made cinema imax experience movie keep edge seat keep glued hour run time long thats way masterpiece story told feel emotion character get appreciate oneness nature everything character resonates world around definitely must watch film hope surpasses b mark set avatar cause thats way get justice cameron true god cinema
visually film great definitely fantastic experience dive world pandora unfortunately film doesnt want marine documentary educational film underwater animation blockbuster want tell u story story bad lazy really horrified especially considering year write good screenplay even without prequel plot would bad fact additionally identical plot part really shocked saying hey look show best underwater animation enough opinion sequel successful movie time
basically story watching since star war lovely family scene preyed uswestern style military might coupled alpha male v alpha male fight name kid designed tug emotion kid induced peril cgi scene reminiscent serious war crime child held hostage really couldnt write emotionally awful scene many baby child even pregnant whale like creature attacked destroyed military hardware worst kind maybe positive people better understand whaling industry work problem come lose empathy real war watching stuff need child see train future world director need responsible film add nothing positive world likely untold harm find new story ridiculously low film least

honestly one best film ive seen since thing like batman endgame wouldve preferred spider died instead older brother despite still liking spider added movie older brother much better character cared himim glad colonel came back main villain like actor ive seen kinda annoying hell villain next movie felt like side villain military woman dont know name wouldve lot better opinion hopefully another character balance next movie
great though sometimes redundant world building character building three hour movie wish intermission would return thing soon bc love longer movie format sometimes need bathroom break snack im left hungry pain dont want miss anythingi loved movie felt transported invested nostalgic first movie rewatched preparation movie leave theater feeling good aboutyou feel care put character world pandora design biome culture different navi language visual auditory absolutely fantastic story simple profound visuals tell half story
least minute film could cut dialogue sharpened least resemblance plot sophistication introduced one kid saying tied get award best injoke yearif happened would great film wonderful effect instead great effect film lead next dont think watch know whats coming effect must costing much studio determined squeeze canoverall disappointing experience could much better

basicly mainstream action flick beautiful setting guess shouldnt expected fantastic story still hoping interesting look beautiful world pandora instead old literally marine grunt spewing stupid oneliners braveheartlooking main character still sound like stupid grunt run family like marine squad much learning pandora way like watching hollywood action movie lot shooting good v evil tough oneliners kind moviei recently rewatched first avatar movie better every way visuals rest disappointing star
visual masterpiece one arguing picture transport another world feel like swimming diving animal avatar effect phenomenal tell took time thosewith said wish spent half much time actual storyline plot character clearly predictable happen wish solid character development everything except visuals subpar best would never call good film spectacle like visiting amusement park
sea avatar go fight alongside sully disappointed expecting see skill way communicating sullly fight big bos never happened ended sully v bos boring cliché give star beautiful sea creature animation movie lack power mote skill waited year even possible think people give thus star love avatar graphic come come story disappointment
want swim new planet among gorgeous creature watch theatersswam avatar orgy magnifique visuals spellbinding performance breathtaking action god created earth james cameron created pandora id rather live latter nobody mean nobody know make sequel better james cameronslow start led amazing story family visually beautiful movie ive ever seen epic ending emotional action made hour feel like short year making well worth itill wait avatar
holiday husband took nephew age watch visuals amazing story predictable lazythe vfx environmental effect best could produce female objectified make bros never listened like human brain dead part anatomy powered genetic construct beingnot one u left theater feeling inspired impressed ingested lacked originality character depthi would recommend waiting come streaming platform
avatar way water really new american movie still without doubt going end one big player award season probably almost everybody western world seen original avatar movie maybe still remember back close fight oscar james cameron wife kathryn bigelow prestigious trophy year bigelow film contention still new avatar film going dominate oscar nomination best picture camerons direction seem possible though maybe even likely one thing film really great shot winning visual effect category might award clearly project meantmeans lot cameron also one writer also among editor obviously cannot call movie dimension oneperson project contributed really much could year already since first avatar film went quickly think plan make four five avatar film total sure situation right one thing safe however cannot take decade film next anymore seein cast find pretty much name key player first avatar movie huge surprise mean given gigantic amount people see film everybody would agree board especially lead actor sam worthington whose career gone super great last thirteen year zoe saldana also still waiting first oscar nomination really achieved anything beyond kid choice bet award far surprising aspect perhaps sigourney weaver stephen lang also part cast well weaver listed really early credit one scene movie thats lang return bad guy first film ie soldiershumans returning avatar like one center story intention honorable though obviously say good guy fight enemy like first film enemy look different also transformed go detail cast member find familiar name rather face maybe like jemaine clement edie falco even oscar winner kate winslet first already dont think guess money make difference starred camerons titanic course biggest negative criticism first film maybe also eventually reason win best picture oscar story new good original enough time cameron got two screen writer board namely rick jaffa amanda silver worked together many occasion familiar blockbuster contribution planet ape jurassic franchise charge surprise subtlety thing running time comfortably three hour confirms eventually also seen throughout film many occasionsone thing caught attention almost comedy movie mean obviously expect constant laugh see slight comic relief even serious film nowadays also fantasy science fiction film look saldanas guardian galaxy movie guess complete absence lighter material cameron want take away one bit gravitas entire scenario term nature threatened true life love main character moment little bit subtlety actually would nice includes neytiri example really struggling character found fitting described bad guy one occasion totally insane mean clearly hypersensitive term sens screaming something bad happens nature peaceful singing mother instinct fully ready kill whoever order protect kid etc bit much also fewer four child already indeed busy procreating tenyear break end first film key action one lot happened inbetween still found bit confusing see invasion beginning everything flame read letter another year passed yeah big jump time movie maybe bit exaggerated must say writing movie biggest strength feared would case horrible still moment like one kid spot another female water people immediately understand probably romance going happen two course also defends little later water tribe folk teach hero skill least take world moment like film could needed subtlety depth instead staying surface time sorry enough water metaphor though lack subtlety crucial positive way could saythose handful negative aspect listed still think film deserves positive recommendation whole visual side breathtaking indeed pretty much keep film sinking oops sorry whalelike creature really cool mesmerizing even bit ridiculous protagonist son would tame creature right away nowhere first encounter mean running already enough coincidence bad guy taming another creature like sully first film felt interesting completely hopeless really created bond son absolutely cold emotional oh yeah screaming character express discomfort also like son final scene many example human exploiting trying exploit nature another area became much much instructive pile message right course sometimes le still many nice moment decent attention detail like saw one female character think falco workout early moving artificial skeleton torture scene looking inside one character brain also interesting watch film also big success visually outside open wild nature maybe cheer one win special effect oscar know hollywood really love james cameron much certainly much would like case film winning said award would travesty effort time put iti critical though maybe making le intensive film every two three year instead one like need decade get released might better idea offense cameron though choice alone outcome convincing never moment would give thumbsdown also box office surely major success would even say think film superior first honestly story totally uninspired time regardless pocahontas improvement overall guess note surprised one male character died towards end tried hard entire film kill bigger player came short emotional side must say still fairly difficult truly care nonhuman nonanimal character middle franchise weaver solid actress inclusion really sake could left reference tail awkward slightly funny way sure intended way rather like depicting closer animal monkey pull others tail music alright maybe often brought back see tune word well dialogue write somebody like song fitting name also given eye whale creature alone better exaggerated segment boy help injured creature way marine creature cool like one get whole lot elaboration really also factor term story alright give second avatar movie thumbsup suggest give go watch cannot say right choice best experience probably crucial watch big screen take time anyway still seen small screen legally would say film pretty much exactly expected delivered visually story weakness solid experience big screen mustsee close favorite though go release date still go see
hate movie plot written solely dumbness kid excuse poor writing screenplay opinion work teen kid definitely adult expecting meaningful story hour runtime absolutely stunning visuals story leaving theatre feel disappointed wasting minute climax could trimmed atleast minute let one main character alive next part many cringe moment like kid behaving dumb extend movie make irritated liked st part hundred time fresh idea visuals effort made even achieve awe first part brought sorry might went expectation really hope dont next part

well bar first movie high sometimes problem sequel match expectation movie stunning visuals imaganarity world stopy seems copied bit piece first part difference soil water story quite slow considering hour long act double edged sword sure coming backdrop already established imaginary world remarkable visuals advantage year advanced technology thing required gripping story
never easy talk avatar average audience seems masterpiece cinema indeed avatar saga general masterpiece cinema masterpiece effect talk cinema let say better market avatar spectacular eye leave magic first chapter left saying beautiful film contrary opinion simply deserve success normal science fiction film average budget try surpass first chapter fails intent point wonder worth seeing another chapter saga focus visual aspect little functional plot construction without making many spoiler film leaf many question mark marketing move work ask much longer willing wait get answer finally want say film beautiful admit one particular scene cried surely collection making excessive opinion
even though people say vfx good one want watch hour national geographic blue water documentary theatre getting movie story average fame avatar go start watching movie theatre look watch every fifteen minute movie end basically vfx good story sks watching digital platform good option skip many part give six star spending much money time worth think watch
took year make seriously directed like videogame overly spedup action sceneshorny teenager buried real james cameron definitely go back theater avatar movie fiasco wait stream watch didnt even feel much time either fairly flat movie moment projectile flying particle floating front image proper pacing slowing scene create actual awe wonder everything fastpaced like made complete maniac letdown wow even visual spectacle time plant animal look like plastic figurine videogames cutscenes made even obvious jarring see hfr failed even basic task many said writing also bottom barrel stuff like script average videogame betweenmissions cinematics considering dark fate fiasco im starting believe james cameron actually dead replaced lookalike keep marketing going
strongest element second outing visual effect dont believe ive ever seen cgi look good good fact put many modern movie blockbuster shame action scene disappoint surprisingly pretty brutal far story found little refreshing see personality character nice family dynamic jake neytiri child colonel quaritch also bit dimension character likely continue explored future film biggest gripe story feel bit thin movie long noticeable plot hole bit jarring problem also carry first film like heavy handed environmental message lack nuance prevents potential interesting idea explored could add depth story credit rolled found film improvement massive one improvement final verdict
youre falling banana tailpipe funny hollywood math first movie good enough make much money secondly mathematically impossible spend million ticket corporate spent billion come let spend rest hollywood think listen anything say think youre stupid since mainstream medium whatever say go mind thats think really going go took star war new hope year three dollar ticket back day biggest legitimate box office success world havent invented math explains theyre day possible im going flow look like gave star reality give zero star
doubt visual aspect movie amazing beautifully donehowever story insult minute introduction see family kid villain first movie seek revenge another war start difference stupid low budget fight movie surroundings beautiful specie blue would another dumb revenge movie cannot understand movie highly rated especially older folk kid would certainly liked well bored left first half devastated really like first part avatar lot one favorite movie
visually stunning great sequence thanks feel lifelike however thats basically end itthere seems bit plot going first third film theme revenge family struggle adaptation new worldbody barely anything going apart visual scene drag way long minute needed whole movie basically drag forever ever including ending neverending plus several plot element basically forgotten therefore quite uselessif least minute shorter better yet hour probably would decent sequel sadly wasnt case
overall okay film sheer spectacle grandeur immensely impressive cinematography effect good show true light seen imax normally like film made exception work fairly well much originalmore made new character esp grace daughter definitely come however despite spectacle story line fairly weak couldnt help feeling original avatar back genuinely original loved really seemed like long around min found looking watch time never happened first one sure ill bother go see original instead frankly much better
come latest film james cameron delivers really made big screen completely different level image color masterpiece film like seen cinema thats cinema made chance look imax sure see unfolds full potential cgi oppressive like film pleasant notice really shot water totally see film film multifaceted deal many topic family feel outsider much film build slowly doesnt change quickly take time individual character thanks james cameron great film minute fly rather long would imagine forgive everything fit ill watch wednesday imax watch cinema biggest screen cinema offer
endeavor garnered positive attention smack engine mass ass thing bloat way via predictable narrative inevitable nonconclusion whatthe paper thin story dressed cgi remains paper thin rambler amount window dressing foster interest unremarkable character yawn lotcamerons heyday come sadly gone emperor new clothes treatment idea there sequel pipeline save precious time avoid sequelproduction value ace everything else hard pas hence deuce

expectation high film visually beautiful place cgi look unrealistic strange overall film definitely stretched far wanted rewind film hard sit still think hour running time would perfect lot unnecessary redundant place plot boring predictable seen lot similar event seems copied first part something slightly changed definitely try watch second time third part definitely watch cinema

really liked first movie one number two seemed long film last approximately three hour seemed endless say kept watching wife wanted finish watching view original story water protagonist relearn use mean transportation instead air water part monster save one child reminded story pinocchio monster swallow gepetto end bad guy saved strangled drowned revives nowhere save saga continue look like looney tune comic thats folk
dont get anyone would make visually stunning movie storyline ten year old put together james cameron thinking plot weak end excruciatingly long three hour movie thing didnt care happened character main character weak confusing plot hole could hour movie max wanted watch something based underwater would watch david attenboroughs blue planet even finding nemo least decent storyline whats going avatar pathetic drivel thank
overarching plot may leave wondering writer thought thing enough subplot action scene pretty scenery make rough framework meaningful emotional journey spiritual essence first avatar film remains character relationship film feel genuine although quite bit loose end left definitely entice avatar subplot consists teenage naavi coming age story jake sulleys son find sense belonging new clan much like jake find spark romance creature bond difficult relationship resolve time father second son often stepping line character journey feel familiar different sense much lie ahead character additional film probably franchise new protagonistand good move film heavy cgi use sound feasible expect another lengthy wait time avatar make clear aging cast put constraint long movie take deaging special effect going take another number year perhaps best involve new castwhile avatar sort feel like two different project merged one sequel first film basis third offshoot film still james cameron film classic moment within there merciless mechanical action like terminator claustrophobic sinking ship sequence like titanic snappy oneliners ethereal music course ending credit pop songi also see movie imax movie theater glass fun immersive experience there lot swimming fish burning ember holographic screen etc nice absolutely necessary
enjoyed sequel much remember enjoying first avatar film back storyline anything fresh mind blowing many element movie done well expected visually captivating film made sure see biggest screen possible wasnt disappointed underwater sequence imax made movie story experience time really gave sense water james cameron knew giving u something beautiful look made sure plenty scene showing scenery color interesting sea life way water treat eyeswhen action really take final third film thrilling would even describe battle action epic surprisingly brutal given pg rating story even managed make bit emotional eye welled tear couple time way water daunting hour minute runtime credit didnt feel long pleased well sequel work standalone havent seen first avatar film since first time film made want go back finally watch think may case like original film prequel one

visually experience need see film cinema fully embrace experiencebut story simple also major plotholes thinking watching movie may dislike movie movie see one time cinema visuals probably wont need revisit movie visuals storyline seen time alreadyin conclusion film left bitter taste really wanted enjoy movie story developing movie
avatar way water definitely met expectation enjoyed every single momentthis movie visually stunning straight gorgeous every single movie shot mind blown storyline great nothing wouldnt expect character good depth character felt bit unnecessary like spider spider set next avatar movie felt like purpose acting work great although hard rate cgioveral beautiful movie mind grasping moment looking forward avatar
avatar film attend purely visual immersion sparkly magical like first film water time narratively needed good minute trim two le kid character addition coherence first film evil human relentlessly magical ore meet energy need film human back colonize pandora since weve apparently trashed earth moving mission well second act focus shift whale hunting purpose getting antiaging oil except human download entire memory computer chip rebuild new alien body capable reproduction also military spend million regenerating unhinged colonel whose purpose personal revenge entailing death dozen military paramilitary type loss armada supply process there lot type convenience plotting nothing move character one crisis another dont go insight go imagine cool would ride dragon

story human wanting something extract planet sell back earth valuable sully main character go tribe learn way hunt rise local animal end big fight scene one local animal thats bigger one defends navisorry thats avatar meant review avatar story human wanting something extract planet sell back earth valuable sully main character go tribe learn way hunt rise local animal end big fight scene one local animal thats bigger one defends naviyou catch drift basically first movie
see traditional movie experience emotional visual ride dive back like existing experiencing pandora first time like traveling foreign land leave expectation behind let take tripthe story actually quite simple really family like first film really connected aspect like feeling like outsiderthere moment drag little couldve edited shorter found audibly gasping stunning scene behold also became emotional specific moment acting superb especially zoe saldanaif enjoyed first film must watch worth jaw dropping visuals alone watch imax
another visual masterpiece james cameron avatar film one see visuals actual story visuals absolutely incredible im glad cameron decided hold making movie technology really show weird time whenever character go underwater feel like film shot world best iphone mean positive negative visuals look amazing frame rate different make feel weird beautiful underwater scene jarring go back surface frame rate different first avatar well story okay fact story little bit worse feel like hour movie stretched character acting kind place quality wise acting good like zoe saldaña kate winslet actor like sam worthington arent great job sam worthingtons character great kate winslets doesnt feel important story okay im going avatar movie story im going visuals since visuals good feel satisfied movie james cameron keep making visually spectacular movie ill keep showing enjoyed first avatar want visually breathtaking movie would definitely check
saw avatar last night bit dissapointed basically nothing new deeper story kind copy first movie much war deeper storythere error strange decision end water tribe help fight sky people suddenly gone go outcast whale help beginning og dissapearswe also wonder water tribe end say sully neytiri part neytiris family come fromwhen kiri get sick nowhere norm arrives sully neytiri long away homespider unnecessary cool army man get kid another woman unprofessional strangewe saw movie cool effectshopefully better else buried
hate want plot character good enough mustwatch cinema great experience bad doesnt drag worthy watch way could argue movie would still good without neither recommendation giving experience production high level highest moment action scene visually stunning repetitive dont think character cringe played well towards half movie felt little bit dragging got better maybe jaded movie could give bad rating say great time awesome see possible technology nowadays
waiting year expect something honestly story creative boring understand pandora beautiful graphic strength avatar dont need see movie duration without moving forward plot many interesting thing add story answered simply cut duration many thing dont make sense anyway premise lead way water ridiculous movie humanized predictable creativity james cameron one favorite director movie change everything
adventureaction story always element either doesnt get enough exposure doesnt quite gel settingwhat remarkable avatar way water seamlessly story evolves everything tuned become quite complex thread story line acting photography special effect sound music importance exposureconsidering length took produce much improved follow initial avatar incredible everyone involved managed keep alert avoid mistake recurrent problem working long time projectpresumably project vision director must provided always right directionit well worth going watch version although screening extreme show offered guess going disappointi enjoyed every moment fully immersive experience avatar way water although story much smaller scale able transport fantastic world title stay story cinema experience journey story make forget everything else theatre stranger avatar way water
great experience dont want story complex want movie like set bar movie experience nothing capaired thisi like amrita mention sanskrit word india country like way james camerons mind work imago place landscape love way jake sully family shown want watch world also show earth earth habitable human anymore human coming kind advanced technology also discovered pandora
important thing movie lack plot mean meaning predictable dialogue best poor repetitive phrase like see way water try give u deep meaning apparent reason also effect hype created didnt see meaningful difference way felt like addition wasnt constant scene like effect lastly duration hour serf purpose weak plotall dont thing ever see avatar cannot give anything
follow original sully family move water tribe avoid drawing danger peoplethere lot movie right worldbuilding thoughtful character creature design pacing family dynamic focus kid way parallelism real colonial history setting future instalmentsthere thing movie wrong enough focus jake neytiri bringing back quaritch maybe much actionoverall think slight improvement original one hand movie little le focused enjoyable people go movie anyway
would given length think overstretched least hour star deducted james cameroon felt overdid time length story wise referred element according hinduism first one covered earth water remaining come well focus firewind space story wise turned personal revenge story rather focusing destruction pandora time water visually one counter movie spectacle watch director reduced length hour would ideal watchhowever hat magician james cameroon pull winner part mega movie series

long film boring dry area good final fight however general predictable elongated story line based around family longer term film franchise vision doesnt really pack punch middle area film incredibly long dry beginning end best part shame film first hosted great platform however nd certainly fails deliver cameron produced stunning visuals ultimately great visuals make good film way component film however put together correctly maybe im wrong im harsh film
sad second edition avatar truly magic eye production crew create truly beautiful world highlight movie there zero emotional connection character never seem develop way one character particular especially painful second screen sadly dialogue poorly written poorly executed jakes child say bro least time like bondi beach pandora jake remains character memorable name whole movie odd moment film ruin overall story totally predictable expected whale important girl epilepsy diagnosed scene never returnsa movie youll never want watch
despite incredibly beautiful movie showed great meaning good amount story building setting assume super intense final two movie understand people may enjoy fact le happened like think stepping stone part enjoy big fish friendly big fish youll know mean scene looked bad also like character spider one bit horrible acting mistake integral story think true main character something made movie feel organic surprising thing movie dont think anymore james cameron captivated intensely

female writer would really helped dumpster fire script really gonna female character constantly ignored husband little consequence jake sully insufferable husband father also year couldnt come new villain reallyi wish couldve enjoyed vfx without character ruining moment exposition every secondsbut visual effect really stunning see beyond distracting expositiondriven dialogue treat audience like theyre stupid youll probably like movie couldnt watch vfx youll probably like
yeah decent visuals point absolutely amazing one others obviously rushed mainly metkayina attacked rush counter attack poor cgi scenesthe story absolute messi get lang wanted revenge killed last outing ffs really really weak plot point zero requirement movie made literally sense whatsoever earth spend fortune cloning guy shipping space get revenge single guy isnt even fight anymorespyders war paint constantly touched beginning scene touched latter movie yet look like permanently freshly donewildly inconsistent water breathing made little senseill concede wasnt shown much time jake nyteri spent learning new way life kid definitely able spend lot time underwater without issue yet end seeming impossibility spend minute get sinking shipto go along wonderful animal seem respond daughter go snag convenient air balloon backpack one doesnt think ahead slightest half dozen follow ship rescue attempt simply wouldnt make sensethe human supposed reasoning hunting torkun get magical life halting serum ok sure yup totally possible magical serum exists world discovered absolutely nothing whale easy hunting first unlikely human happened kill one second unlikely anyone happened drill skull foot drain random fluid point would fluid third who testing drinking injecting random brain fluid year evaluating apparently stop aging process one literally one odds finding slim even slimmer theyd testing anti agingthe main thought movie much mirrored happened native american new vastly superior technology brought bear themall mostly beautiful film made little sense
excellent cinematography cgi visually stunning throughout even without story pick first movie book endedlots family interaction new habitat creature seems target youth adult avatar child engaged story could better sun plot added seems get little stale confusing middle pick endbut lot fighting graphic violence time could reduced similar first avatar movie probably could trim film back minute without losing contentoverall still great movie
jake sully protect family pandora huge threatsound familiar plot thinner wafer top later denying impressive visual feast avatar love special effect action sequence simply sense nostalgia original would recommend however youre seeking something new may find little lackingive read several review comment didnt feel long personally felt least hour long could easily edited little trend three hour long movie isnt everyone hard sit long especially get little olderwhat concerned quiet screen highly anticipated film screen half empty decade long gap much people abandoned cinemaopinion worth going see support cinema

avatar way disappointmentlong awaited disappointment long screen time seems national geographic animal planet show sometimes feel like happening supposed watch thatover hype best director highest budget make movie good watching didnt find good reason make sequel without good storyplease wake mr cameron dont interest avatar series please show brilliance good story screenplay eagerly waiting another masterpiece
overall pretty enjoyable way long given amount money spent achieved tricky task actually looking cheap time switching digital film medium made disconcerting watch like watching two completely different film crudely stitched together maybe something u watching version felt like watching film reverse rendered bit weird film thats pleased course look beautiful aesthetic definitely dominated storytelling first hour could done min get theyre happy flee protect people happiness doesnt need hour lockin cameron needed strong presence alongside force tighter edit
awesome movie actor fantastic job dont even really understand kind mysterious special power secretly wields u dont even notice thats keep tricking u spending hardearned money see movie much weve made commercially successful director time james camerons typical trademark pretty much movie dutifully employed avatar story paperthin visual treat watch movie cinema hall
dont know guy im impressed visual part movie cant stop thinking bad execution first one much better depth overall thing front eye awe part like im watching avenger stuff converted real depth anything coming screen remember first avatar filmed camera wich made movie expensive ever one obviously disappointed could great movie lead u story ok average thats

visually avatar certainly provides sadly storyline well expectation crap different daysame confused confrontation without real substance opportunity pull something stunning instead rehash marketing people believe pull plenty spiritual inspiration mixed bit whale rider titanic fact scene almost thought watching titanic felt script would worked yr ago spiritual awareness shiftedthe inspiration mixed marketing think sell ended something lack contradicts leak like sieve hopefully avatar keep pace globe intelligencewe well beyond spoon fed outdated idealsmasculinity shifted beyond kill zone gender isnt defined physicality spiritual divinity balancing divine feminine divine masculinebalancing nurture action feeling practicality avatar needed incorporate evolving global understandingkeep pace audience involves creative risk confidence script sadly script doesnt keep pace visual capability let hope avatar doesnt get lost delay production keep pace suspect might need storyline rewrite otherwise might like watching yr old sitcom
largely thought avatar boring long predictable inconsistent cgi video game esc movie filled poor writing conventional hollywood story structure lot beautiful definitely groundbreaking technical filmmaking aspect however uncomfortable frame rate water scene including strange place poorly made cgi initial water attack loak stuck like sore thumb furthermore genuinely started drift asked surely hour drag could engaging hour epic initial antiimperial postcolonial proecological message first movie powerful uniquely done shoved throat without ever taking originalchanging angleoverall fan first film definitely wasnt worth year wait cameron prioritise character development credible writing original story structure trying break box office making big buck

really liked first movie saw release day cool new thing called nose hurt like hell heavy glass hour worth watched time year really looking forward sequal time skipped chose normal version really glad movie art phenomenon every frame like painting really like underwater world almost much forest first movie cast solid time fly basically copy first movie defend home family attacker basically story movie get extra point beauty cgi get additional point dare kill main character get final point dare go norm today must include wokeness movie try give audience really want people think everone want
loved first one high expectation one bit disappointing im judgy fact always try enjoy movie matter watching felt like unnecessarily extensive childrenparents drama etci dont know decided would entertaining see avatar giant sea creature weak hopeless instead itd greater see realistic fighting scene superior robocop techsyes movie everyone shall see effect fine episode like nightmare watch force finish ittook year making critical fair know screenplay nothing impressive hereby mention mr camerons fetish sinking boat although beauty pandora greatly displayed
visuals story james cameron seems forgotten he making cgi alien lifestyle documentary movie storysadly story completely missing sure funny wholesome scene start slowly start feeling boring movie hour long constantly looking watch see itll endthe action good climax lackluster mention wasnt much different part one actually wasnt different allit complete waste time hero villain ending duel result victory side villain even survived unscathed heck hero suffered insteadthere zero conclusion anything end story whole movie making hero realise need fight instead running away yes im even disappointedseriously knew itd boring id rather slept home waste weekendi seriously hope one flop dont deal james camerons senseless flexing oh look mah graphicshe may genius aint
overall enjoyable experience breathtaking visuals however definitely time felt like trying drag relatively simple plot purely sake cgi flexing sometimes feel like taking cgi tour virtual museum actually watching story go anywhere understandable want audience get full experience different fictional region explored movie dont know enough justify making movie three hour long real meat storyline could arguably covered likean hour lol still think pretty good movie

accumulated longing sequel filled heart every cinema fan past decade sadly demolished mediocre shocking movie honestly cant believe actually waited year disappointing sequel although knew sure watching last night wouldnt dethrone first part highest grossing movie time even reach level artistic dramatic contentavatar way water without doubt one visually stunning movie youll ever see big screen breathtaking scene leave disbelief poor narrative made feel like watching episode national geographic one thing learned year beautiful visuals dont necessarily make good movie rather enhances viewer experience get maximum feeling director want convey unlike first part one nothing add whole avatar story term plot dramatic emotion nothing action film even merged first one without even noticing even though first one sequence abrupt event first hour actually served plot revolves around human conflict deciding whats right wrong moral code someone play pivotal role serious decision makeis bad absolutely avatar great battle scene water world beautiful creature thats shallow beauty substance

spoiler withinwas really big fan first avatari felt like first half movie similar first avatar except sea instead forest learning ride shoot etc also except son learning similar feel like star war ep bit mirror ep would give first half nd half really good action packed fit together nicely get nd half wasnt action made better first half felt like rehashing wehreas nd half felt actually telling story first half felt like crawled whereas nd half flowed welli also kind hoping would different bad guy doesnt really explain spider kiri whole immaculate conception thing doesnt doesnt really jive unless explain later otherwise seems like lazycheat way put character storyline without actually needing give rhyme reason got might turn later explain part also maybe later give background spider kind felt instead growing story first half son couldve spent time explain two piece
story avatar way water quite similar first movie avatar came back vfx better feel much realistic first moviestory wise connection first movie able make audience bit missingnevertheless sequal great job compared move sequalsits sequals generally cant exceed prequelswell happy see old character first movie back action also beautiful view moon pandorathis movie left cliffhanger end let see happens third movie avatar
movie letdown graphic may people plot nonexistent time felt like direct copy movie lion king holding baby sunstar leaving offspring forbidden zone black panther pretty much whole movie feel like black panther continuancetitanic end scene terminator random wanton violence destruction hr long movie congressional approval needed movie longer hrsi reluctant criticize james cameron creation certainly huge disappointment
first avatar movie outsider creating chaos money navi suffering greed wanted protect land way life culture let ruined men greed sky people clan united fighting land leader story strong substance connected u emotionallyin one however chaos revenge bad guy system played along master villain leaving agenda back burner couldnt get connected storystunning visuals expected jc

movie beautiful visual effect another level patent new cgi method incredibly boring feel like time nothing everything happening plot predictable best non existent worst plot line utterly senseless adding drama extending film wont watching next one theater wasnt money spent would left scene felt like replica scene first movie right word movement character youve seen youll know mean point dialog felt extremely childish

thats real masterpiece literally new revolution cinematography admired wonderful water animated especially know incredible work hide behind best experience life connected avatar saga thats main advice watch wide screen cinema dit feel story isnt ended thats maybe people think light simple disagree really enjoyed every single part maybe little bit disappointing someone see beloved hero getting older stepping second role thats way life way water
came seeing amazing film highly impressed cinematic brilliance visual sound effect well written story linelet u start fact wait year witness sequel worth introduction great way pull audience new story yet linked previous film narrativeto young audience introduce mr camerons movie please make sure watch avatar go watch way water get full grasp remarkable plot sure develop third film lesser time framei rated movie solid every scene crucial development building perfect plot giving character personality top notch director feeling moviewhen seeing magnificent story please enjoy full artistic cinematic capturing essence plotalthough rate movie complaint audience get see previous war sea folk happened rest forest folk welli edge seat amazed pleased cannot wait third film release shorter time frame waiting decade help fan interest movie dropped monthlyfantastic film james cameron pleasure witness work thank
first movie story clear motivation natural evolution plot second part story almost non existent entire movie jake family run hide company rda mercenary deployed sole mission kill lazy story writing make impact viewer area like animation vfx cinematography sound etc excellent without strong storyline movie struggle keep interest alive entire length minute point feel like watching natgeo documentory marine life
avatar one favorite movie guess thats reason harsh itoverall admit special effect part movie amazing combine new technology actually give audience another great opportunity feel planet one time detail great ship cooland think mr cameron really try many new element movie see point many family scene movie reflect family important u however guess havent enough time neither express idea incorporate element whole story seems like pasta many story lined intertwined full randomness word themotivation character sufficient justify action example main character jack often unaware consequence actionslastly really surprised single part movie actually touch emotion somehow feeling watching soap opera believe movie meant bring impact emotion definitely failed
rarely someone improve something good original avatarbut wonder took long next installment series happen term special effect story presentation new character next generation took time two side movie epic get point development story confrontation discloses obviously military presence going go away invested pandora put exploitation type exploitation described movie sea sea people undoubtedly brilliant move uniquely different water people movie good right way water spiritual definite heart however good movie looking forward next
review scoring think give fair indication quality movie fidget lot hour passed without even noticing however would recommend watching gold class extra comfort like first visuals incredible new creature introduced brilliantly done story line time make scratch head colonel know daughter honestly story move along good pace big screen time almost make feel like themcertainly recommend watching gold class whilst watching dvd streaming service still great belongs big screen
year write much better story first avatar clever interesting sadly opted rip previous movie instead bringing back villain practically plot device whale brain matter instead magic rock adding dull revenge story seemed even reuse dialogue line first movie well new character way water poorly written lacking personality making poor decision good reason justify hour screentime left disappointed movie visually stunning world building pandora mesmerising first one part captured attention excited sequals doubt cameron take risk offer new idea series liked first one enjoy one
way water grand spectacle like earns star purely visual experience absolutely worth watching thatshould watch well executed effect stunning first minute forget wear glass cant stand visor youre missing much watching dunfortunately way water feel small compared original plotwise one would accuse twow epic hour episode mini series epic movie lot filler might generously filed world buildingusually would earn movie much lower score book awed stunning imagery willing accept twow merely setting stage future installment tighter meaningful story
nothing like even close quality visuals unimaginably outstanding like coming much capable future cinemayet isnt one greatest movie writing direction plot hole allover shallow acting especially disposable bad character exaggeration human evilness take away didactic experience story doesnt dive deeper depth could happen many way sequence different scene problematic familiar talking james cameron
avatar presenting humanitarian issue main case storyline movie humanitarian issue replaced personal issue related character revengeand totally fine see movie copying story arch first movie even though two movie arent walk line sharing issue clear writing technique completely movie repeating archanother unsatisfying point spiritual ritual spiritual musicsongs first movie missing one ritual gave depth first film unique stunning vibe couldnt see vibe movieover music score le expectedpositively speaking art department production designer job correctly stepped game much higher level comparison first movie unique artistic set design island village outstanding costume prop could bettervisually movie spectacular joyful outstanding
movie many opportunity great instead went way marvel phase never ending battle scene lack quality storyi went group agreed introduction water tribe great scene water creature training awesomethat said ridiculously long fighting scene praying would end movie could hour minute long cutting nonsense way antigun fact im much pro nd amendment movie abundance battle shooting really hurt overall quality film story character development awesome creatureanimal interactionsthis movie failed succeeded time weve waited long would watched matter next installment like ill wait til watch free homealso warning parent child could real problem never ending violence movie graphic first come violence violence sully child might want watch first allowing child watch
name movie loved first avatar well wait see gun kept waiting movie become energy drink commercial american flag flying background shot liberal disney james cameron pretend issue cultural appropriation insane amount gun even poorly timed teen gun seems boring film literally exact first one dialogue insane amount gun almost point gun fetish guy loos arm
film technically brilliant especially underwater scene like diving tahiti whale amazing glad see communication people sea creature character stereotyped woman mostly fearful men largely courageous two third film fighting major turnoff conflict could cut hour look like target audience teen boy isnt good first avatar focused environmental message violence save time money stream first film
visual effect unparalleled depiction bond relationship family race tender smooth three hour long total worth ticket price episode reduce big battle two one focus life ocean pandora imax dolby cinema release full potential film recommend people go two type cinemathe new character amazing im particularly fan kiri year old sigourney weaver magnificent job portraying year old girli couldnt believe acting saw cast list charming
overall sitting first right theater visuals spectacular especially always fascinated biology pandora lot potential showing different adaptation environment time marinate poor writing cultural appropriationan anticolonization movie anticolonization movie still perpetuates white savior trope steal indigenous culture different outfitsbeading african people stolen haka maori culture good look movie talk respecting navi culture environment simultaneously stealing real world culture character blue mean forget white actor behind face jake sully character never locs spider never locs could go cameron close hitting point passed himif franchise continues like never left
story continues first movie visual effect exquisite sound editing well seems director obsessed ship sink world watersometimes thought watching titanic happen watch imax theater fully appreciate art course sound plot good first one music good outstanding want see good special effect go see bare mind extremely long least hour could cut dont wait extra scene end credit
movie give immense satisfaction film lover really enjoyed watching big screen special effect action scene underwater scene good missed mediation part calm mind refreshing help connect across specie story gripping would loved individual depth power part character really missed xray eye vision part original story provided time ocean view cinematography visual experience good editing could crispbut would definitely watch

movie absolutely worth wait every frame beautiful much passion hardwork put felt like journey another world everything look real story simple yet there something beautiful really show person passion achieve thankyou james cameron creating pandora character spider confusing didnt care rest movie good ive watched theatre time already cant wait watch cant wait next avatar movie hope directed james cameron
completely forgot story first avatar movie movie started documentarystyle intro world pandora swiftly dove smattering spaceship combat scene raising child loosely tied together thread exposition think trying make subtle confused getgo movie go take many different storylinestangents manages tie together somehow endits still confusing though grace daughter remember scattered scene extending backstory know epilepsyor also really epilepsy im professional vision seems convenient boy get fight first girl get bullied jakes younger son get fight apologizes chief son try get murdered apologize thing become actual friendsat least think thats go think tuk supposed comic relief get effort point doesnt work gritty serious movie feel also still dont understand paikon fish considered outcast considering quite obvious didnt even killingthe write review realize many cliche disjointed story wonder even watchedof course visuals amazing even since privilege seeing immersive imax like tookoon thing nice big pentagon mouth girl one fish shes cool shes favorite charactersoyeah
movie almost must see cinema visual experience watching amazingnot message carry also beautifully shown way navi connected world around basically continuation message first movie think shown even better form tulkuns whale experience world avatar connected get good feeling cruel human towards living thing prepared horrendous thing self interestthe reason didnt give movie higher grade plot designed way lot unlikely scenario happen thing turned way also found recycling villain first movie little bit cheap move better villain could thing found annoying navi humanised way behave speak like human living modern first century city given culture physiology structure personality completely different human never behave similar human
like golden vial effort based marketing greed movie feast eye storyline beyond empty lack logic many human character lack richness character without provided dimensional depth reasoning leave viewer questioning script storyline writer actually able get wrote screen whether manipulated marketing profit return calculation algorithmsimply put storyline insult intelligence viewer whether marketed solely audience defined test audience giggle guess know live hope someone decides take potential gem something unexpected original intelligent decide write script character actually make sense actually bring everyone life visuals amazing storyline contradicts lack dimensional richness putting paper thin character perspective going provoke response moving direction wish left feeling experienced hr min void stuck pile chewing gum certainly feeling drawn view avatar going tangent paying watch silent movie rerun imagine character actually something communicate
fantastic movie quite literally unrivalled term visuals found got invested character gravity situation faced went cinema thinking would far long movie watch found flew quickly engaging start finish way quite simply magicalim likely watching first core avatar magic theme bond family get see character explore role within unit face existential threat absolutely fantastic
dont know james cameron made sequel avatar titanic time honesty great movie well worth watch definitely must see cinema atmos glory amazing visuals expected passable storyline obvious plot hole well worth time enjoy cinematic experience like ive finished review stupid reason deliver another letter stop reading want character left till post review ive managed get zero
visual spectacle one miss watching big screen best visual effect far ever seen movie cameron far best directing capturing action sequencesas far story concerned quite similar first one le consistent however hr run time enough hr would better enough character development engagement character seem unnecessary edition doesnt serve real purposein inference extended version first avatar film sharped visualsawesometecular
marketing movie undersold movie movie generation movie lifetime nothing could prepared beauty james cameron team filming past decadecameron called manhattan project totally correct blew away hard getting hit bomb wouldthe movie minute time wasted honesty didnt feel lenny movie grip firm properly could watch another hour get tired enjoyed every second movie highly actionpacked beginningthe visual effect close perfect better million movie released far properly keep title effect simple stunning fall love exploring waterline pandorathe movie little corny dialog beginning theyre overwhelmed beautiful story best visual effect seen far absolute mustwatch cinema great finally blockbuster like quite since last
let clear avatar thing beauty animation sea sea animal everything else fluid pun intended hardly believe special effect visual effect bigger bolder previous movie point found literal awe seeingnow let discus everything else storyline isnt exactly original lead character new family danger must flee home lead character past sin basically predict movie go deviation new character added jakes child member navi water tribe sea animal even arent enough keep storyline interesting dont get wrong plenty action three hour literally flew glued screen whole time end movie left wanting something moreas predecessor idea present visual masterpiece avatar succeeded regard avatar raise bar expect oscarwinning performance wellwritten dialogue original storyline
movie visually stunning groundbreaking far amazing following reason get every avatar trying push boundary technology capable point visual detail dont matter done budget allowed make good movie ultracomplex well done hairrigs super realistic water rendering best motion capture animation couldve madefor least make good movie overall artistic value cultural value provide get detail lot subplots senseless also make already extremly long movie even longer really need another minute fight scene loud explosion two feel like lot potential wasted someone high position decided need ten subplots add nothing main plot dont push story forward pure entertainment subplots rather blunt senseless therefore really entertainment rather reason keep cinema seat longeri imagine difficult make movie quarter billion dollar without writing producing way certain level kitsch predictability mass
admit seen film twice opinion completely changed first time round found quite overwhelming missed finer detail film seeing second time thought absolutely fantastic equally emotional love james cameron holding mirror humanity done planet went second time family loved new character introduced likeable give avatar fresh new feel beautiful vfx excellent acting emotional storyi cant wait return pandora
great movie feel like first movie better introducing character tha cgi smooth wish felt sad older son passing didnt feel like enough connection kid definitely watch list liked started storyline definitely left open rd filler story whole movie great made want miss happens next gripe really animation animal really bad compared first might water gave choppy feeling

avatar way water basically first installment character unfortunately arent fleshed well enough care storyline second version avatar basically almost exactly first movie year ago even seemed didnt know direction wanted go mashed different event idea randomly together hour movie eventually left unsatisfying feeling effect however yet top notch feel character real alive screen however afraid gimmick worn time alone wont contribute significantly enough anymore make film watchable

looking forward movie amazing visuals weak story excessive violence throughout three hour basically battle movie highresolution video game character mystlike cg environment definitely proenvironmental movie movie maker seemed celebrate rather condone violence whale hunt scene zoe saldanas character best part avatar unfortunately given little finally editing jarring surprising given four editor credited including jim cameron looking forward avatar
first movie magical jake sully free bold simple changed man movie extra weight pressure husband strip away character barely recognizable guess thats life thing loseadded onto intense atmosphere convoluted theme one kid hate dad another kid meet dead dad another kid want know dad isso think many new people place introduced without giving enough time audience properly absorb theme miss simplicity sure kind message movie wanted convery manywith negative way really enjoyed naytiri performance there something captivating presence visual stunning could look day felt like magic idea earth produced family bonding nice though abit pushed sometimesevery scene felt like made soul thats think love avatar world

im going honest fan first avatar movie lot people love movie ill admit used one people nowadays find pretty boring fact think kind suck yes movie visually beautiful strong acting performance good moment held back done story hollow forgettable character awkward dialogue terrible pacing weak grasp message upon hearing sequel work would feature kid lead previous film jake neytiri well stephen lang coming back sigourney weaver playing kid thought going disaster despite impressive trailerscome opening night see showing first half showing little girl like six year would talking nonstop think heard people say shh like seven eight time get young seemed enjoying movie get annoying good hour remained quiet final battle happened became loudest ever heard second movie turned woman sitting beside said annoying kid ive ever seen theater responded yeah rightnow im done talking awful theater experience actual film enjoyed lot think improvement upon first movie basically every possible way think interesting character interesting story better visual effect obviously memorable action sequence top movie three hour long never bored second ive seen movie four time already didnt even like first one thats high praise isfirst idea jake neytiri parent kid something paper sound disastrous execution work really well three kid character get really fleshed development going get better every new installment seems like trend bunch kid character running around movie show going adventure nowadays disastrous work well whole film revolves around kid dont like least one film work youi especially liked middle child loak first come bit emo edgelord throughout course movie make baffling decision end one decision result death brother there even blood hand symbolize he responsible brother death also bit hiccup toothless thing going whale creature named payakan scene beautiful narratively visually also idolizes jake feel like jake doesnt love way love sibling come full circle end save others life there see scene thought quote stupid romantic dialogue first movie pretty beautiful lot way he main character film way charming likable jake ever throughout first movie whenever jake succeeded something reaction whenever loak succeeds come top im screaming mind yeah anyway thought great child actor gave fantastic performance love interest interesting though maybe shell get next movienext there kiri who played sigourney weaver pretty odd character pretty interesting opinion control environment around like poison ivy like loak bit emo sometimes could really tell sigourney weaver time bought year old there spider who tarzan looking dude promotional material he okay performance left lot desired ill go easy since he kid actor interesting idea character sure human wear oxygen mask run around loincloth navi character sound awesome also bit romantic thing going kiri bit weird considering age actor im sure theyll find way make work revealed biological father quaritch boring human general villain first movie played insanely underrated stephen lang im sure thats really possible whatever ill let slide form bit friendship navi clone quaritch two child neteyam one dy tuk one who like seven comedic relief super flat forgettablenow brought let talk quaritch massive step first film actually depth im evil military commander he really character think impressive thing doesnt single screen kill yet james cameron successfully created charming charismatic antagonist gotta give credit something havent heard people talk final battle thought way better movie wasnt high consequence thing first movie focused character struggle small scale battle middle oceansadly cant said jake neytiri theyre boring character nothing sam worthington zoe saldana think theyre fine actor seem like nice people dont really like character jake little better film neytiri basically development think like one navi commando clone also get guy first movie least personality although like scene see brother character afterlife end really good moment im sure anyone who lost child felt something therevisually speaking film marvel every single bit cgi look good whenever human besides spider front center film somehow looked worse underwater scene stood heavily easily best looking water ive ever seen movie ever make actually go swimming saying lot im terrified oceanive seen people saying opinion movie basically opinion first movie cant agree thought one way detailed deep emotionally satisfying first movie could ever also saw people say thought first movie better dont know movie better one basically every single aspect besides maybe music rest peace james horneroverall enjoyed movie lot know might reading review thinking im overhyping ive seen film four time already ive liked every time ive watched flaw like couple plot hole stupid narrative moment like immortal whale juice throwaway line payakan saving loak nowhere eaten shark thing admittedly pretty tense scene water clan disappearing halfway final battle mention inconsistent frame rate issue beyond really nothing wrong movie think majority people prefer one original year come yes think third film better probably think said done avatar one franchise repeatedly binge watched like lord ring trilogy original star war trilogy guess well wait see

never really found kind movie good man movie amazing made cry time watched second time cried im emotional person fact movie made cry amazing build movie good professional watch let know agree scene didnt really understand graphic amazingly put together ending good heard others saying wasnt true waited decade movie entirely worth watch plot amazing well connected first avatar however think acting kinda trash kid annoying asf think spent much money graphic couldnt afford good actor human movie
dont listen snobby critic movie true spectacle world james cameron created full life seems real way hundred creature unique design people culture religion truly created masterpiecenow onto story thought fantastic definetly better first thought colonel amazing bad guythe first felt like generic action film much going one feel lot heartfelt emotional really make want good guy succeedgo see movie imax look fantastic much effort attention detail put every scene
hard believe sequel avatar actually come year feel like halfadozen delay officially hereas someone surprised much movie held recent viewing therefore high expectation sequel id say lived hype maybe little le great id sit little longer could sureandi word define movieits amazing experience unexpected end vfx cgi wow say thank james cameron sirthank sir giving u experience

money story dialogue bad sadly even stunning visuals found getting bored restless relieved finally compelling story character pull get reminded glorified saturday morning cartoon blockbuster movie better graphic liked anticolonial environmental theme went pushed patriarchal nuclear family ad nauseam irritating found pondering couldnt better story telling resource disposal guess spent much money production risk averse fell back following tired holywood formula well seems worked appears film looking big financial success
avatar way water beautiful movie probably best seen yearsince first avatar great ending afraid sequel however movie much better expected good firstmaybe best part movie trapped specific label movie fiction romance beautiful relationship family friend action scene really good one heartbreaking momentsthe new character interesting relevant plot loved see another culture environment among navi tribe different even though specie basically movie beautiful visually emotionally

visuals avatar amazing breathtaking might say movie messy came story many review discus storyline furthersomething noticed jake neytiris kid finger isnt jakes avatar human real navi neytiri kid real navi wouldnt chance kid also fingersim sure finger made see difference avatar navi see who halfblood wouldnt realistic child jake one hand finger one hand watching avatar way water high frame rate fun want see really good movie story wise avatar best choice watch
im sure people exactly looking story found breath fresh air pun intended lot desired felt purpose considering plan movie main thing breath taking movie effect world building lot world building sometimes take away story hand story pushed along bit faster much time spent looking effect world building story opinion nothing hated nothing adored either im sure everyone looking youre looking break marvel star war disney b great film escape honestly checked box good movie everyone else said bad im honestly curious say good film feel review pretty harsh concerning story character
highly movie critic far best movie year usually research watching movie hate idea wasting time movie really didnt make feel like waisted time make really appreciate nature god wonderful creation like usually lot research watching movie let save time go watch wont regret itwhat didnt like story kinda slow patient help build stronger connection actorsfinally recommend watching imax general im probably going second time around didnt first time
ive loved avatar ever since little girl mustve watched time safe say long cut character exploring beautiful world fantastic job cgi team problem allfurthermore character first film written perfectly new environment really enjoyed seeing life changed last yearsits slow paced film work art focus exploring world character detail rush thats say there action really good fight sequence holding breathon whole absolutely loved movie similar original yes also new exciting emotional beautiful think believe pretext film get nitpicky plot detail enjoy ride course fault story strongest said fan first one need watch one truly magical experience get absorbed story one didnt want end also go see version really well done avatar mean come onon hand expect every interaction plot slow paced one film feel like drag forever rhythm really nice dislike sequence director explores world dismiss naavi blue constantly complaining long film dont even bother watching leaving bad review film thats clearly suited taste
completely taken visuals story animal world creature movie far favourite part realism graphic created phenomenal semblance fakeness seemed completely realnow reason giving ten infuriating writing plot literally bring bad guy back avatar form first mission happens bump child enemy u military apparently abandon strategic thinking order seek revenge one man family move another tribe order put tribe danger instead putting new tribe danger bit grief conflict resolve run anymore would think mean going back original tribe nope mean staying tribe like two week final battle must also mentioned entire tribe disappear end could better finale epic fight scene thats matter make senseanyways beauty underwater scene magic pandor connectivity nature way human decimating land machinery bring totally enjoyable seeing dx really quite great well
graphic plot arc many cliche revenge arc teenage boy arc poor wounded outcast animal become friend arc many unexplained thing like sigourney weaver character get special power jakes communication device come character acclimate water easily answer lot hole ending obvious lead another sequelwas daunted initially three hour run time went quickly might actually see week get full effect
visual nothing wonderful story really couldve better bad simple story cameron magic even average story make amazed good movie pretty message family difference also usually cry movie prepare hour minute went past flying least usually get bored movie long nothing happens whileall character likable spiiiiderrr get attached there also really good balance suspense comedy jump scaresi noticed thing left kind open story probably make sequel
seen first movie like yes like one dont expect overwhelmed definitely keep awake hour movie duration appreciate genius cgi new world enhanced navi water ecosystem advanced script writing storytelling attention detail storyline continuum remake first one fight jack sully invader planet earth believe room improvementdefinitely james cameroun spent decade imagining sequel content script cinematic decor character new environnement paid could spent time imagining maybe different story line like disney successfully star war saga return investment would much much higher
mainly movie last one good hour movie scene move really slow thought would interesting like last one turned really bad asked people around told asked smaller cousin liked told boring movie got lot hype really dont recommend going waste money time say action action part movie last bit enough since hour movie want take opinion would really recommend going even friend told waste time money

never review movie even like experience feel compelled say something show appreciation james cameron everyone involved createdthe stunning visuals creativity innocence love power raw nature movie immaculatebefore watching slightly doubt movie could add first one really delivered unique waynot necessarily main plot carried movie sense quite similar first one half hour there lot go
kind watch theater watch kind movie unparallel experience cinematography watching movie theater watched imax never much mesmerized visual effectsbut movie fall behind story line story pretty much predictable much engaging movie literally stop flowing point recovers would definitely recommend movie theater experiencealso average viewer sometimes got confused different character look similar sometimes big issue
film lacking wellthoughtout plot scene character spare give work must cost itthe length excessive considering plot extremely basic messy reason sustain hoursoverrated effort involved special effect deliver easy overloaded beautyit even entertaining basic way qualifies panorama go cinema see short film full repeated long scene unnecessary dialogue character full firework could justify massive audience enjoys
immersed visuals wow pretty think huh cool place wonder whats going downfall villain surely wont human last moviesurely plot wont stunningly beautiful waitcontrol c clickcontrol vclickmaybe experience ruined started looking plot around half hour instead waiting till h min mark even rather disappointing entire experience summed wow thats pretty cool thats also amazing visual effect plot would recommend watching cause look cool would leave around hour forty ur wasting time staying longer
honestly couldve plot storyline would still love movie visually breathtakingly stunning world pandora james cameron created unlike anything ive ever seen avatar twow expands even farther beautiful world made u experience let tell truly experience especially seeing film beautiful storyline anything protection family connected nature truly get right heart thats film centered around
idea movie star know film feel like hour long bad indeed long depressing hour love fantasy story way told poorim sure anyone else go cinema fun enjoyment whole film brutal cruelty injustice without much happiness make worthwhilewhat shame created amazing world amazing special effect becomes self indulgent long spell underwater scene dragtrying think positive found whole experience painful disappointment hindsight would paid double ticket price see waste eveningso disappointing would think talented people world industry could sooo much better

visuals action scene stunning consider choice moving plot seaside area good one recommend watching dthe plot hand leaf thing desired premise earth resource depleting let risk loosing little personal vendetta someone charismatic leader resistance gave u lot trouble since stepped character choice often make little sense one liner feel childish cringy despite breathtaking visuals movie way long felt exhausted end good way

film good opinion avatar design also good havent watched try watching film exciting besides opinion avatar design also smoother previous avatar second avatar also took quite long time watch exciting neytiri already child child adopted sully family also moved another village live want try watch watch directly cinema avatar currently airing also contains sad scene
sad movie sad waiting long time presented travesty im even really surprised still hurt even thin hope dashedi refuse believe james cameron much anything writing reek hollywood swine infecting botching everything intelligence sense even logic there creativity either recycled bunch recognizeable favorite original well facepalmingly shameless cut pastethe movie seems like different imitation franchise took script low budget ripoff hired camerons effect time got uwe boll directsuffice say im interested however many installment follow feared avatar gone way matrix amazing first movie one worth watching worth forever
movie jaw dropping visuals unlike film ive seen us advantage make extremely immersive easy get lost also serf curtain hide problem hole plot character james cameron set failure right beginning adding many new character story little explaining part narration jake character easy attatched yes dont much individual personality james cameron explores bit interaction within family doesnt time explore fully bit way hour could chew older brother who name forget crudely created character personality watch sibling said perfect brother never shown personality apart relationship younger brother similar character little time dive character always someone neglected every scene possible personality left like absence jakes wife water scene seen comforting kittiekatie im sure little crisis scene add nothing overall movie im sure addressed one sequel serf purpose film waste time could exploring older brother making sacrifice meaningfulyes film beautiful look especially contrast narrative detail dumpster fire impressive directing cameron poor writing improving last avatar thankfullydangerously hopeful see sequel hold

okay let get something straight beginning yes visuals amazing get unreal engine promoi never expected wished outstanding plot say honesty went cinema without expectation plot yet matter much good armed nothing could prepare horrendousness ive witnessedthere absolutely nothing coherent movie whatsoever there many character many plotlines much stuff going there many moment require massive narration explain backstories much handle nothing go direction never purpose neverthe character part unlikeable could bondempathize single one themi add really big fan film plot character always make bad decision without exception also without learning outcome character development film absolutely missing gonei dont think ive ever felt much disappointment film ever life deeply disgusted
thats itthe good thing graphic imagination overall find fantasy novelnot mention movie didnt tell meaning curtain word predict flow also expect curtain act new character like water tribe way fighting monster le memorable moby dickthe bad side jumping hitting hard story plot nothing worth mentionits sally stick together family kind thing cliché boringthe protagonist way strong may arrow made vibranium
film easily best film ive seen term visual quality quality cgi impecable used scale never seen beforeunfortunately ilogical cornercutting plot stoped apreciating quality special effect seemed due focus cgi story suffered particularly beggining decision made character simpily didnt make sense felt like poorly written excuse change setting lost count number hostage situation end lost meaning started assuming captive character would escape two character looked identical sounded simmilar made difficult dicern felt like maker film relying viewer question choice made character blindly belive protagonist
debate movie one stunning cgi work ever james cameron employed unique technology imagination produce wonderful worldregarding movie theme touch scientology faith oppressor v oppressed human greed family healing love doesnt hit like first avatar case enjoyable make perfect family movie plot simple dont think thats weakness movie kindthe weakness however dialogue character didnt feel like belonged especially spider felt place cheesy many time
whole expectation crossed overall good experience excellent vfx storyline liked want part visual effect production highly situational meaning there lot different approach art successful vfx shot first training ever seen acknowledges right front proceeds numerous example walk viewer number approach technique achieving certain effect showing doesnt work often educational value showing training excels throughout course viewer left good understanding possible sense best approach tackle particular challenge
bad follow initial hit film main plot second film first film bad guy come back confused motive human prescience need new home resource local bad guy advantage avatar count nothing subplots prolonged often resolution first film dealt connection pandora environment jake learning inner conflict original mission new found love assumed knowledge going second film seriously lack depth need long run time drawn poor film wanted far better

film enormous potential unfortunately plot choice made led inevitable tram holesfrom visual effect point view obviously flawless cant make resttheres many thing answer example sort forest villagewhat happened precious metal everyone wantedwhy water village razed ground one think ask scientist original villagei dont know almost seems like film right thanks lame apology given title avatar
avatar way watermy personal opinion movie enjoyable although flawsthe graphic film really good amazing breathtaking character also rather interesting entertainingone thing missed voice acting actor example battle jake cloned colonel neytiris scream son death felt realistic really impressed itthe plot movie le impressive thing mei sometimes really confused happening movie fast scene changingin end think could recommend movie others perhaps theyll enjoy
great movie full well researched people group lot great storyline family honour loyalty love friendship emotional roller coaster ride post production would taken hour hour workweta digital amazing doi seeing go onto disney awesome storyline wonder go rd onefull blue people semi green peopleit great watching towatched behind scene work amazing technology used make thisthanks great movie james cameron team many business people poor soul movie
movie long editor pushing back enough simplistic plot clearly setting avatar love invested movie theater must seethe original better concise enough allow repeat viewing story simple enough fit oneoff movie movie shot foot making run time long le screening occur per day one come back repeat viewing bc longstill amazing movie definitely need seen theater like first movie
though jake sully child enjoy spotlight movie script show getting captured repeatedly violent killer thrown life threatening situation yr old distressed movie obsession keep sully character alive sequel see violent death one child life threatening violence another child cmon family movie depicting something gruesome end sigh relief gun knife pointed child used childrenon child idea family movie imho
happy magical native invaded big badass shrewdly evil morally corrupt military zero conscience empathy nuance wildly unrealistic excessively violent duel lasting minute real life one single blow dealt would fatal crazily unrealistic fight countless bad guy get killed miraculously one good guy family hardly get scratch ho hum tired templatethe special effect fantastic prolonged scene underwater vista beautiful story twodimensional predictable
like first film visual effect spectacular story lot bland first hour rehash first film except underwater even go exact bonding wild animal sequencelike first film well sam worthington incredibly bland actor big problem effectively voice overthe plot colonel downloaded memory saved case died also incredibly lame like year old boy asked create story could bring character backthe colonel feral son another unnecessary plot line colonel attitude completely inconsistent characterthe biggest issue run time film need three hour run time simply get everything could properly edited least hour nothing would missed three hour film epic three hour long simply poor editing something consider third part marvel also take note
look fantastic dialogue leaf much desired switch subtitle english early crowbarred allows u skip reading let script revert american english accent still alien make senseplotwise film relies character original provides familiarity whilst introducing new alien live nearin seawhilst underwater scene genuinely spellbinding attempt use next generation main character give much le serious feel character introduced insufficient confusing explanationwhen alien specie youngster asks yet get sense low scriptwriter aimed disappointing

definitely recommend movie amazing visuals beautiful reference nature however plot follows really old fashioned stereotype cringy moment father protects child woman shown overly emotionalalso make sense army disappears end leaving poor family fight entire army fighting suddenly trace themi also dont think necessary kill one child felt like ran idea closer end started putting random typical hollywood thing like killing good one getting everyone else revenge everyone already good fighting extended movie real value added

wanted rate came theater like bad movie liked le thought itthe writing film chaotic mixed messaging clear theme way first movie character motif dont feel authentic number side plot get lost somewhere gun fire sinking boat explosion none add anything viewing experience alien robot fighting burning boat exactly original idea daysthe animation certainly beautiful time except every action sequence basically felt like marvel movie dont consider compliment youve probably heard lot buzz technology developed make movie honestly feel like moana impressive ten year ago nothing special postmarvel era cinemaoverall worth hour minute dont imagine ever sitting

regret waiting year time great value small ticket price even though didnt see imax regular screen made possible viewer concentrate enjoy although story beginning boring work image graphic make u unable take eye outstanding graphic design flow profound scene still considered mellow extreme sad sad excited super excited scene extremely exciting best movie ever dont know say thank make dream true
stunning cgi definitely worth paying extra see imax however year wait money must spent cgi film shane effort made ti deliver full packageit shame didnt write better storeyline though film almost carbon copy storyline original film relying simplistic tweak themewould still recommend see though would recommend seeing cinema imax fully appreciate iti know third film coming honest le excited due expectation another weak storyline

let start saying particularly movie popcorn type person butas avatar movie james cameron introduced new character give movie depththe character build newbie amazing emotional give warm fuzzy feeling story plot fantastic bearing mind avatar movie incoming movie lead perfectly onto avatar visuals masterpiece mona lisa cgi movie james cameron pinnacle creativitydo question watch long runtime believe finish think want wont even notice time went
visuals amazing next level even absolutely beautiful today technological advance movie huge budget certainly nail graphic movie thatand thats unfortunately movie plot extremely ordinary felt connection character wanted feel sad angry loss life lost cant none event compelling enough create bond viewer character induce reaction event also cliche predictablethis felt like case movie trying tell many story set sequel
could broken separate movie released time would gladly paid see part part physical pain sitting almost hour movie longer minute long great entertaining film people complain writing probably wannabe critic snooty film student im excited see disney ride department go see movie family fun night give opportunity talk kid global issue related destruction natural resource
visualy stunning like first film cant see took long make sequal story weaker character new charactrers lack substance old character uninterestingi lost count many iconic scene character film ripped mad max star war jaw moana free willy jurrasic park name fewmaybe expectation high spoilt many wonderfull film thought provoking plot subtexti felt film lacked eitherif blessed child subjected watching disney film feeling get dvd case pulled cabnet shelf selected whatever streaming service heavy sigh sinking soulders feeling would best describe avatar
u yet still scenario movie hour seems rather trivial go yet againthe thing save story small interesting bit seapeopke forrestpeople play entire scenesyoung blood meet young blood old blood meeting old bloodthis surely enough give one higher expectation avatar character developmentall get star effect wauwexperience star plot definitely top three mist beautiful moviesd glass must goto
id say watching expience amazing every angle great visuals emotional storyline personally loved easy dive story within story movie exceeded expectation every way find movie deserve hard critic iti feel downside tad bit long could packed storyline bit together however big downside movie couldnt really feel time passing catching plot mesmerizing visuals
lot illogical point film first part talked wonderful property crystal give infinite energy dont people mine theyve driven avatar planet earth dying would million people live pandora needed oxygen would people kill avatar werent aggressive human could simply live another part pandora planet avatar behaved aggressively thats another matter show aging fluid discussed film scientist initially learn liquid
overall give im enjoy watch something miss effect plane landing nothing wind effectthe second spider broke ship controller people watch stop people stop himat least goodi like grapich sound story etcfor hour show enjoying watch end feeling boredand want watch watch first movie watching previous movie feeling little bit confused story line character etc enjoy grapic
watched first movie time came month ago isense dthen last week part isense dnow yesterday part imaxthe plot forgetable maybe star even part better therewas bored watch yesterdaybut difference imax isense experience big im sitting write reviewdo imaxthe perception depth light detail much better imax format difference really strongthese technique demand special expertise dedication screening director two option make great leave drawing board wearing glass almost hour theater hassle unless movie super great said go imax go home
movie marvellous visuals demonstrated sad side humanity emotionally draining best way way movie make feel especially scene whale really affect youmy expectation low given second movie find generally tend worse first case james cameron disappoint absolutely fantastic normally find hour movie long time flew really get immersedi really recommend going cinema see visuals take sea world
movie wonderful contains wonderful visual vision lengthening event beginning beauty directing visual vision make wonderful experience especially family highly recommend itsome event ended cause kiris power water sacred tree father fate spider whether father return definitely come back point view expect new part hope sooni recommend watching movie theater using wonderful experience
thought could put aside bad plot enjoy spectacle spend waaaaay much time jake dumbass kid water scene neat far minute film delivered cool visuals sense wonder rest stale revenge plotthere different composer music recycled instead epic wasnt immersive like original story felt extremely contained didnt imply going worldi havent felt let theatrical release since last jedi insulting boring derivative safest garbage disney coulda pumped
movie captivates get go stunning visuals captivating cinematography technical workaround movie seems make pleasant experience viewer story simple predictable hour seems like long time story line could easily cut short min easily one best movie year movie experience watch big screen movie touch emotional cord base storyline family parent continuous struggle keep family safefinal thought dont miss thisover rating
think topnotch special effect film ecosystem beautiful marine life presented film made feel real however shortcoming film narrative main character family flat beginning make people feel little sleepy watching feel plot strange narrative human being film undoubtedly failure convincing reason audience explain human weapon fragile kind understand necessary plot movie cant fool really weapon human year also understand cameron want use film describe growing child way move forward third film problem family part really boring gave movie special effect amazing imax really worth
reason avatar movie always attract large mainstream audience always looked skepticism people saying long boring back people enthrilled movie theater went mass three year later boom pocahontas mixed dance wolf happening watching sequel ive started figuring dont know something movie grab first avatar probably one technically immersive visuals ever made one far yes vfx improved unknown level honestly remained stationary since wouldnt complain look unbelievably good even day still cannot deny movie organic alien environment ever sometimes navi look real look like blue people weird nose im saying negative technology also upgraded much since first movie got robocrabs inflatable harpoon weird mechas dispense eye candy people fed start reject inertia first one already appeared backlash seriously good bad dont think fact think sequel superior predecessor many aspect although sure overallso main problem movie funnily enough agree majority movie needed enter editing room bad h min long scene completely distracting baggy example action sequence first act could resolved without entirety wouldve given movie lot momentum later confirmed find third act already full action considering already kidnapping need another one first act ask writer guess another example whale second act lot sequence lot whale one main protagonist pack number sequence could trimmed one two wouldve made second act much tighter yeah thats problemi know people want hear complain character admit time around character vastly superior jake neytiri child actually enrich dynamic cast distinct trait maybe exception neteyam bland old brother jakes character seems different little compelling he tough vulnerable coward time character drama neytiri something either absent poorly executed avatar quaritch better since much threatening charming sadistic tough much bigger role action true character retconned like hell basic villain yet thought concept interestingly enough kind movie spider human adopted son well character lot problem specially towards end movie acting felt alarmingly amateurish think struggle motivation defining people would like admit yeah dont like spider hand kiri probably best character entire film yes voiced year old woman didnt really bother thought added aura weirdness mistery character meditative ethereal yet mature personality lastly wanna talk neytiri first movie absolutely showstealer almost saved movie wonderfully well casted act great sound great feel threedimensional actually think sequel still see great zoe saldana much brings character example scene see emulating sound animal warn child also prejudiced towards sky people way even year character seed fine say really disrespected character sequel barely appears exception third act serf emotional support kid jake cry much good sometimes justified sometimes eventually neytiri still one compelling character sadly squandered enormous potential character overall decent clearly improvement must warn rotten apple way like one already mentioned forgettable one like youngest daughter edie falco character kate winslets characterwhat plot uh boy time get rough around movie serious case sequelitis meaning great chunk feel like retread first one literally ton example here five annoying exposition beginning voiceover literal repetition shot avatar repeat literal action sequence forest trimmed would much much better instead cameron copypasted dumb catchphrase think fast kansa anymore excessive amount filler scene give wow factor second actbeyond movie filled plot convenience evenso first movie headscratching line dont make much sense fact plot hole big brings whole movie one everyone talking sully family move forest live reef people wont spoil anything reason leave omaticaya behind flee quaritch doesnt make lick sense also brings quaritch care sully family know jake known leader navi insurrection thats mission quaritch assigned engage omaticayas forest leave alone mean plot hole big could fit space shuttle god sake problem plot simple people say neglected important plot point got much time ahead refine script absolutely excuse thati also want talk character moment really dont go anywhere like scene kiri seizure scene seemed pointless helped engorge runtime maybe gonna relevant future sequel doesnt quite fit onewith doesnt mean script terrible fair much le lackluster first one character seed flourish later movie thought cool like relationship neytiri spider spider kiri way tie whale subplot water training third act good enough worst script worldthe action boy ready witness full display movie basically got one hour pure unadulterated creative action james cameron pull punch character go ballistic probably best action ever directed since true lie know people saying rehash titanic truth us resource improve upon formula setting fleeting environment battleground something absolutely done better action first one every aspect except one action first avatar feel much grand epic stake huge every single animal navi part thats something somehow lost sequel dont get wrong bigger scope doesnt always mean betterthe score ok bring back lot track first movie add piece sense beauty grace like songcord zoe saldana specially underwater soundtrack good hand lot generic string piece unavoidable guess james horners soundtrack first movie slightly better smidge thoughall dont trust socalled critic eye candy end day action movie family set another world alien specie sequel work well enough movie passable riddled problem yes fix problem first one yes creates others yes
family talk avatar revolutionary special effect overwhelm support movie story portrayal navi affect movie emotional impactwhat theme cameron consistently work film compare strong female character avatar terminator titanic similaritieswhat political message cameron exploring movie theme relevant whats going today world think message stand test timewhy important respect different cultural group treat tradition practice valid importanthow navi human ally use teamwork achieve goal important character strength
longer needed hour go quicker expected story flow expected really surprise classic story arc seen would ok character stood made care also regard nothing ordinary spending hour sully family dont really feel know well left little emotional impression mean hard care look forward rd movie technically well made well crafted overallin summary feel like decent way kill couple hour good excuse eat popcorn memorable

let start pro cgi music overall ambiance amazingi personally prefer experience feeling playing game explore live fictional world etc get look goodthe plot spoiler everything go downhillon first movie jake sully brought pandora fill brother shoe avatar explain investment cost time taken make avatar complicated would better train start zero new scientist understand doesnt matter theyre reviving grunt making avatares purpose even reviving scientist behind data pandora make sensethe coronal theyre unit respond whats purpose investment whats mission hunt navi familyearth trying move pandora dying spending resource coronal doesnt make sense main plotfinal scene water avatar attacking human ship seem winning help whale nowhere everyone gone sully family didnt surround finish enemy go doesnt make senselater appear holding hand jake sully saying home etc theyre alive left battle seems sloppy im nicethank reading
give major cred visuals seamless cgi vibrant color beautiful environment story mediocre many sub plot meaning conversation unnecessary watch want fun long movie fill friday night personally ill never watch againim honestly surprised star entire movie set fast pace hoping create sense urgency dont really feel character there many keep track also entire point movie jake would save people family obviously would followed wherever went seems pointless leave first place
overall movie decent opinion visual art definitely make worth watching theatre story line unfortunately similar first one mainly depicting criticizing imperialist mindset american use force obtain want war story war aside movie beautifully shot acting good film consistent showing cutting edge visual creation use water left theatre appreciation creativity anything else long movie could shorter story line however beautiful cinematic experience felt like right amount time
really liked movie visuals fact kiri sound like old lady brought experience every time screen wasnt voice either didnt speak like teenager whole performance felt like meme doin fellow kid far realistic ask dont get didnt use young actress least aged voice hollywood always seem think important thing personal brand reputation far outweighs actual performancehaving character speak dialect apart sully also bit weird anybody would speak differently would since first language one speaks perfect navi translated englishall good movie wish producer would le blinded stardom true reality thing

movie indeed truly beautiful visual effect amazing storyline contain twist general feeling aligned general superhero movie necessarily bad pretty unexciting visuals make movie average worth watch id probably ask shortened version watching though even film run three hour hole unfinished part start wondering movie ended however movie definitely worth watching preferably cinema get effect

effect impressive good youre mentality year old youve seen movie two life youll know science end exactly going die protagonist respond also half movie plot visual effect make sure pack lot patiencethe fantasy really lacking especially compared universe marvel lotr star war know rick morty like specie entire stupid planet one type bird half type fish nothing make sense anymorein retrospective sure loved first avatar movie reminded didnt probably inceptioned believe
picture atmosphere movie stunning obviously cutting edge technology story like someone took american family teenager including typical problem argument clichees different planet paint blue avatar much intense storytelling disappointing listening teenager debating parent tough marine papa trying teach military discipline whole planet attack superstereotyped human exploite everything come way without second thought bit much time story simply make sense hightech aggressive human fighting alien arsenal weaponry including bomb alien defend arrow yet outcome uncertain would great wasnt unrealistici may watch next part sofa certainly spend money cinema
unfortunately movie everything much visually stunning beautifully done butthere action scene charachters get multiple time lost found rescued action wceneromantic nature like avatar scene take soooo long eventhouth think look beautifull take longlastly im sad direction story instead focussing beautiful people story avatar main focus standard bad guy come back bigger army kidnaps child boringso big dissapointment whole movie could litterally done min opening another movie

visuals amazing everything water incredible story hand existentrecycled plot character development minute scene whale minute scene whale huntingthe movie could minutesthe first better th story wasnt great flowed kept engaged sequel leaf lot desired could done much story line stopped short screen time visual effect typical hollywood anymore lazy writingits worth watching theater affect
three plus hour runtime entertained character leap swim dive throughout spectacular imagerybut think good movie usually iconic scene quotable line unfortunately movie neither story place create storyline fill missing piece dialogue predictable move thin plot along seems like cgi done first pieced together make storyvisually entertained remembering film
beautiful emotional film poorly written script amazing scene fell short writingjake child wonderful character arc however felt though missing neytiri main character lack focus meant able evolve course filmthe movie villain bland motivation boring manages nevertheless unlikable first moviealso child different accent one another maintained throughout film bizarre plot holeon whole thrilling exciting film absolutely stunning watch

visual performance great even though lot better st movie gothe storyline however thin character evolve much ran mistake like seven time deal boy thing wrong six time one month plot turn completely random whale suddenly magical substance sold lot money okay interesting new heard nothing news published nothing heard anymore plot twist wtfhonestly quite dissapointing expected
first want watch way water cinema highly recommend watch imax visually world like first one also delivers effect either however dont want judge people opinion somebody tell storyscript boring finish conversation right politely possible way water family emotional connection navis environment perfectly shotcapturedpresented throughout whole mooviethe score impeccable mention weeknds soundtrack post creditthe reason didnt give masterpiece im looking forward upcoming sequel want blown away ending character improvings final battle etc also would thankful mr james cameron wont leave director chair end somebody could fulfill fan expectation himin summary love cinema visually stunning film experience avatar imax however year ago first chapter came opinion completely worth waitbest regard fan hungary
didnt bother rewatch first avatar enjoyed watching cinema though enjoyable see next level lack good story make one time show next level incredible action take place literally lap add reverberating seat make heart pound chest explosion recliner pop corn youre set memorable experiencethe movie started fast pace died became slow hour national geographic portion maybe intentionally allow better appreciation effect pace became fast could hardly notice effectsits cameron director producer writer team writer help think told scene wanted direct put story job also decided reuse titanic set lying

first movie look insanely good expected totally worth see least side plot kind interesting like grace daughter control eva something st part movie great streight action human return blue cat fight back like jake naitiri seem like good teami would give didnt like important personal opinion thoughmain story feel like written year old seriouslyif jake run away chase pose threat anymore knew soldier chasing didnt done anything prepare water people ship crashed human got wrecked full military first movie come fishing boatbasically first movie scaled would jump st one rd one wouldnt miss muchhonestly confused cameron planning make movie one lore whatsoever hook story main bad guy besides human war human gonna last movie beat first oneand oh boy biggest sin villain movie generic villain cant even imagine human greedy soldier kill stuff motivation nothing show soldier thats right put hidious sunglass fking avatar
term cinematography sound visuals design movie superb partly due lengthiness however found bored couple time throughout movie mainly middleat start end action packed whole middle segment sometimes felt like filler timesome story moment actually managed make feel sadness dont often experience movie give good representation immersivenessnonetheless grealy enjoyed immersive experience action scene story although latter couldve also deeper opinion
