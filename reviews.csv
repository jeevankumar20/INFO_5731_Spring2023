Review Content
"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No."
"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale."
"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is."
"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?"
"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise."
"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while."
"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.Also, if I have."
"Massive advertising will make sure (just like me) that many people will go see it anyway, no matter how bad the reviews. Especially kids will want to see it. Because let's face it, this picture is particularly targetted at kids and hurrah for them if they are into this sort of nonstop action packed game adventure movie. I am not into it though... NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids. Adults be warned, you are gonna be numbed down after having watched this for over 3 hours.What a DISAPPOINTMENT!"
"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so..."
"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class..."
"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man."
"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable."
The visual effects were great on the actual Navi people. Everything else just looked like a PS5 game. For about 2 hours all you get is Cameron's gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money invested i just cant wrap my head around this.Would definitely not pay to watch part 3. If you haven't watched part 2...dont. Not worth it. Wait for the stream.
"There is a reason Aristotle placed ""spectacle"" last behind plot, character, etc., in the elements of drama. This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes."
I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.
"Okay. I'm just gunna write from my heart here on this one, mainly because that's what was impacted most by this ""movie"". We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE."
"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading."
"Fake crying, fake smiles, unnecessary moaning and random CGI shots that instead of taking the story forward make you forget that you are not watching a cheap documentary but a Sci-Fi movie...There is not even one dialogue worth remembering for next 5 minutes, character building is so bad that director and writers forgot that biggest strength of Navi people was that they were disciplined and loved their culture. Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...Absolutely waste of time and total insult to the intellect of the viewer..."
"This film is visually stunning. It simply has to be seen on the biggest screen possible in 3d. That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira. I know I haven't seen 2001 in imax so maybe that would knock this film out the park but who knows.I'm probably gonna see this movie 3 or 4 more times at least in imax even if it means I'm broke it's just one of those films that is just breathtaking."
"The movie while not fantastic storywise was very enjoyable and well worth going to see it. The visuals where beyond fantastic and makes this years other blockbuster CGI look like a joke. Would recommended strongly seeing it in 3D, while its mostly a novelty that because in most cases its done cheaply as a gimmic. Not in this case .The biggest suprise was how they returned some of the characters from the 1st movie which just fit right in.You either go see it in the cinema (biggest screen possible) or don't bother watching it at all. If your thought is to wait and stream it, save yourself 3hrs and don't bother (unless you have a great home theatre (even then....)"
"First off, there is no such thing as a perfect movie because the way we all experience movies is different. Subjective. I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda."
"Seriously, I've just come back from watching the film in the cinema in London and cannot recommend this film. I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks)."
"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10."
"James Cameron gives James Bond's Thunderball competition on how many underwater sequences he can fit in a feature length three hour film. As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10."
"I liked it, but it wasnt worth waiting 13 years to see. I dont get how it took 13 years for this to be made. I felt like I was watching Titanic again near the end. It was beautiful, but lacked any real story or anything new. I guess I was expecting so much more waiting so long and having to sit in the theater for so long too. I did cry a little, so I gave it 6 stars, but Finding Nemo was more interesting. The story was weak and cookie cutter I've seen that before kinda thing. Why couldnt we have more animal fighting? I loved that in the first one. I just feel so empty and wish I could have some kind of warm fuzzy feeling and glad I watched it, but I dont think it was worth the wait. I guess I'll be dead before the 3rd Avatar comes out at this rate."
"Bad. Just bad. Avatar 2 was a bore fest. Pretty on the outside but hollow within. Style over substance is the right term for it.Pure evil hick soldier is back and now he's even more malign. He has a son on Pandora breathing off of an oxygen mask that has an infinite supply of oxygen. With whom and when did he consummate ? Unclear.Same everything.Entangling pubic hair with beasts, ' we're not in Kansas anymore ' line , taming a big flying vermin , whale juice as valuable as unobtainaium , neytri sobbing again and again , Jake being a wooden protagonist , Quaritch being pure evil.....What's with there language? How is an alien civilization speaking fluent English ? The navis are very much Americanized with stereotypical African accents. And all the kids were f irritating.' Bro. That was insane, cuz. ' Cringe dialogue all throughout.How are hybrid navis even biologically possible?What's with the narration here ? Jake ain't recording himself no more.Doesn't it ever rain in pandora?Repetitious orchestra song in every single scene.A generic, cliched, lazy, pointless, predictable, contrived, silly, stupid and implausible plot with awkward, unlikable, obnoxious, puerile, cheesy and undeveloped characters.Animation does not even look as good as the first one. Everything looks cartoonish. And they got glowy sprinkles on their face now. Desperate attempt to make em cute and lovable over boring ol'humans.Is Avatar the new franchise to replace banal marvel now ? Just as marvel is killing itself with it's dull projects these days , James Cameron is here to excrete right besides em.Funny thing they both share is that no important character dies in both franchises. We got to think about sequels , don't we ?Hated way of water. Found it worse than the first. Still baffled on how the mass is easily fooled by bright lights and explosions every 10 mins. Won't bother with the upcoming sequels."
"I really wish I could appreciate it for what it is, a demonstration of cutting edge CGI, but I just couldn't this time. The novelty factor carried the first movie but the sequel unfortunately doesn't share the same advantage.Since the prequel had some very obvious flaws that were unanimously agreed upon, it is very confusing to me that the creators instead of working on them, doubled down and amplified them. After 13 years and hundreds of millions of dollars; the writing, the cast and the acting remains lacking, if not even worse than before. To be frank, the plot is now so dumbed down that it becomes insulting and many of the characters are so unlikeable that I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Jake in particular, is somehow still celebrated as a hero even though all his actions are those of a spineless coward with no care for anyone but his own flesh and blood.For the aspiring filmmakers out there, I also think this movie serves as an excellent example of poor exposition. I personally found the narration in particular, exemplary cringeworthy.Is it a harsh review? Yes, but with the resources spent on these productions I really think we ought to expect a higher standard of writing."
"Avatar 2 is a huge disappointment. It is a poor rehashing of the original film with nothing new to say. The movie is far too long, clocking in at a staggering 3 hours. I found myself constantly checking my watch, waiting for it to end. The pacing of the film is slow and the story feels dragged out. The special effects were impressive, but they couldn't save the film from its lack of substance.The movie tries to replicate the success of the first one but fails in adding anything new to the story. It is a rehash of the first movie with the same characters and themes. There are no new ideas. The only thing that changes is the location, but it doesn't add much to the story.Overall, this is an overrated film. Skip it."
"I decided to rewatch the first Avatar last night before watching Avatar 2 and I am always in awe of how stunning the visuals are; it was a crowd-pleaser and more agreeable for the general audience. However, with the first Avatar, the story was basic and simple---it was rather forgettable. The thing is, the Avatar franchise has a simple story but it was told grandly. 'Avatar: The Way of Water' was a captivating visual feast, with every attempt beautifully framed via painstakingly flawless CGI, but the message about protecting your loved ones is not new to us, but it was ingenious. James Cameron's level of perfectionism translates to the audience; the details of every frame are precise and I can't help but wonder how on earth he has done that. It is the simple plot accompanied by such technical achievement that has always been the formula for almost all of Cameron's movies, not just Avatar. Simplicity is not a bad thing.Just like in the first Avatar, characters are established a lot, and there is not much emotional attachment during the first half. However, the thrill and excitement peaked during the second act were worth it---This is the trick for most highly-budget films, they will entice you with visual and technical achievement, but the story is not that grand nor special for the audience to keep talking about it in the next 5 years. The Pandora world Cameron takes us to is excellent and magnificently conceptualized, but the story is missing the emotional draw that made this film a pretentious masterpiece. Though the visuals are still magnificent, it's difficult this time not to recognize the repetition of the story and the limited character arcs the movie presented. You will remember Avatar---aside from blue people---as a movie with impeccable and out-of-this-world visuals, but the story remains forgettable.Some films are just pure escapism and sometimes that's what audiences need, and this is what Avatar 2 delivered. Avatar 2 doesn't necessarily check all those boxes to become a great film, but what it does right will offer viewers moments of astonishment, full-body immersion, and beauty. You can easily watch the movie and points out its mistakes and flaws, but it is hard to resist the fun and adventure the film delivers throughout its 192 minutes runtime. It is clear that James Cameron is making this movie for a general audience, and while imperfect, it certainly seems to serve its purpose."
"The original movie was very fulfilling spiritually. It wasn't perfect, but it had heart.This movie isn't half as profound. The visuals are stunning -- we all know that. But the plot is so lackluster it is almost laughable. I'm so done with Hollywood creating these huge blockbuster films with absolutely nothing deep for the audience to grab onto. Apparently we are supposed to forgo the desire to be sincerely impacted by film (or simply not notice because of the insane CGI).For one thing, Miles Quaritch's return is almost ridiculous. We didn't need to see him again. He died in the first film, and they should have left it there. In truth, there are probably very few plotlines that could have made his return seem genuinely congruent with the story as a whole, and this wasn't it. The fact that he just has to come back and kill Jake Sully, and Jake Sully alone, to the exclusion of doing anything to actually further his crew's mission, is poorly explained at best. Why Jake Sully when he has left his people entirely exposed in the forest? Without Sully's aid and knowledge of the ""Sky People"", they might be easy to subdue.Along with the other apparently heartless, one-dimensional humans still involved in this tireless, war torn endeavor (which I guess is now about finding a place for human civilization to relocate once Earth is uninhabitable, yet this motive is only mentioned once!), Quaritch lacks a true character arch. In the beginning of the movie, once it is acknowledged that Spider is his son (although not really, because the Quaritch in this film is just a clone of the original... As the new Quaritch poorly explains to Spider once he is captured), I figured he would have the opportunity to grow. Surely his son (whose not really his son) would help him do that. While it's true that this kind of happens, his development is poorly fleshed out -- like everything else in this movie. Further, much of Avatar 2 depends on the dubious advancement of technology, to the point of absurdity.Speaking of Spider, I really stopped feeling one with the characters of this film when Neytiri pulled a knife on him. I have plenty of understanding for downtrodden, heart-broken individuals who do messed up stuff in a time of extreme pain, but this pushes the limit, and there is literally no resolution to it! The entire film emphasizes the value of family sticking together, and although Spider isn't technically a part of the family, he might as well be... Neytiri's treatment of him was so disappointing given the insight, wisdom, and sense of self-control she displays in the first film. We all go through hard times, but this was just totally out of character; it didn't seem right. She could have just snuck up on Quaritch when he had Kiri anyway (there were plenty of other far more fantastical moments). Or Spider could have done so beforehand, when Quaritch was truly vulnerable, instead of trying to reason with him. At the end of the movie, Jake echoes Neytiri when he says ""a son for a son""... Is that supposed to be some sort of resolution to Neytiri's behavior?In short, Avatar 2 is chaotic and disjointed. Very few subplots are fleshed out and carried the whole way through the film. The result is something special effect ridden, but jaded and confusing, not very impactful on a heart level, and very lacking in all of the depth and profundity of the first film. It's worth seeing if you loved the original Avatar, but you'll probably be disappointed."
"What the hell happened here? We really waited more than a decade for a script full of cuz this and cuz that and bro this and bro that? Where's the story? What's the plot? What's the point of the movie? I knew it was gonna be so disappointing after the first 15 minutes - the scenes are cut so bizarrely that some scenes drag on and on, while others feel like ure watching a commercial for 2 drastically different products. There is no soul, u just dont care about any of the characters, u don't care about the animals (why was he so lazy to just copy paste 95% of the wildlife??) The first Avatar was liked by everyone, no matter on what level u were at as a person - the basic u got the marvel of the avatar world, the deeper meaning too was there, so what's here? U couldn't care less about any of the characters, and some scenes are just funny with the hissing like animals, it was just comical. It felt like a 3 hour commercial for kind kind of sea world. The script was terrible and the only time Jake said to his son "" i see you"" had no weight at all. I went with my dad thinking it was gonna be at least 60% as good as the first one, I left pissed off actually 1.because it was so long 2.at least if u make a 3 hr movie, dont let teens write the script!! Soulless movie. Really disappointed. What was the point exactly of filming underwater and making a huge fuss over it? What was the point of the entire movie actually??"
"What I just saw must have been the Avatar's avatar....can't be the real thing.I can understand that stirring the broth of an old success could be, in the desolation called post-covid cinema, an appealing idea for trying to hit again the box office but this was just ""Avatar goes to the sea""...
Was it too much to expect at least one new idea? Some surprise? That at least some of the ingredients of the old, stale broth would be innovated?Apparently yes, if one has call old Sigourney Weaver from the dead it was clearly too much.And, by the way, did I see some scenes from Titanic? And some others from Jaws? No, I didn't.... Or did I?So Avatar's avatar, with more water, too many bang-bangs and way too many kids around. For never-ending three hours and twelve minutes...."
Very disappointed after watching this movie on a regular theater. I was a big fan of the first movie and loved that visually stunning material was shared with an excellent script that had many parallels. The new edition was a pale shadow of the original. I was underwhelmed by the visuals but that could be because I was watching this in a regular theater and not 3D. I was most disappointed by lack of story (soul) of this movie. Editing was rather poor too with scenes being excessively long. Old characters were stale and new characters were not developed at all. Didn't really form bond with any new characters. It looked like producer and directors were thinking of something else while they made this movie. I understand that there might be more sequels but this edition in itself is not worth the time and the money.
"So Avatar 2 needed to entertain audiences of all ages for over 3 hours. Introduce a huge group of new characters and balance a dozen plot threads. Once again revolutionise CGI & 3D technology. All while providing a satisfying sequel to the highest grossing film of all time, after 13 years. This should be impossible.. Well James Cameron is no normal director.I read reviews that say the plot is a ""repeat of the original."" What movie did you watch? Let's see.. The antagonist resurrected in the body of the species he was trying to eradicate - crushing his own skeletal corpse. A human child marooned on a planet where he literally cannot breath the air - being raised by aliens, now meeting his father from beyond the grave. A teenage girl with supernatural powers - the product of a messiah virgin birth, who is possibly the reincarnation of a goddess. An outcast boy dealing with sibling rivalry and failing paternal expectations - who forms an emotional bond with a genius space-whale who shows visions of the past by swallowing him whole. Parents facing the trauma of losing a child, and survivor guilt. Commentary on accepting refugees and destructive human impact on the environment. And it also happens to be one of the most beautiful blockbusters ever made. Overall, I would say a pretty remarkable success. Looking forward to part 3 already."
"While being a visual feast for the eyes on the surface level, Avatar: The Way of Water has nothing beneath the waves to hold viewers for the over three-hour runtime.First, let's get it out of the way. This movie looks very pretty. The CGI work to make not only the Navi, but the entire world look realistic is incredibly impressive. Unfortunately, these fantastic visuals are not presented in any interesting way. The cinematography leaves much to be desired. It is not bad per se, but nothing is done to uplift the incredible CGI work. Once the luster of the visuals fade, there is not much to hold the viewers eye for the rest of the movie. This is also overlooking the strange framerate issues that pop-up throughout the film. These inconsitencies immediately pull you out of the experience.Outside of visuals, Avatar: The Way of Water has little story to justify its runtime. The middle portion of this film needed a weed-whacker to cut away at least 30-minutes, if not more. The characters offer very little to keep the audience interested, and outside of a handful of well acted scenes and emotional moments, there is little fat on this steak.And that this is the movie's biggest flaw. Why, with an over three-hour runtime, does this movie feel so empty? It's because it is. Devling past the surface-level beauty, viewers will find very little to tide them over."
"The first one did not by any means have an original story, but at least it had a story! The story in Avatar 2 is all but nonexistent, this feels more like a three hour benchmark video for the latest graphics card.Jake and Neytiri are more or less supporting characters, the focus is on their children. The movie really shoves the nuclear family agenda down your throat. One wonders if James Cameron has spent too much time in Pandora to realize that the world has changed, and a family doesn't have to be a nuclear family, if one even decides to start a family in the first place.Jake keeps repeating the gagworthy line ""A father protects his family. That's what gives him purpose."" Only problem is that throughout the movie he FAILS to protect his children over and over again. Because despite the vomit-inducing family theme, their dumb children break the rules repeatedly. Here would be nice place to have some character development that Avatar 2 sorely lacks. When one of the brats breaks the rules for the umpteenth time in a row, they could come to a conclusion: ""Maybe I should actually listen to what my parents say?"" They problem then would be that this is the only way that the movie progresses the plot. A child does a stupid thing -> We get ""drama"".I saw the movie in HFR, and it boggles the mind why the framerate is so inconsistent? It is very noticeable and takes you out of the action.The characters have no depth, a big problem when it comes to Jake's identical two sons. They are impossible to tell apart. 14-year old Sigourney Weaver has almost no purpose except the ending, same with Spider."
"I'm sorry, but wow. I went into this expecting very little and still walked away feeling underwhelmed. This movie is beyond tedious and the pretty visuals only distract you for so long.The runtime is beyond 3 hours, and it is readily apparent throughout the movie. Everything is dragged out except for the story, which is a distant second on the priority list behind visual effects. Our power couple has a bunch of kids who never do what they're told, ever. Angry soldier man is back in an avatar because Cameron couldn't think of a different antagonist, so he implanted soldier guys memories into an avatar to keep him alive. Humans returned to Pandora to kill Jake and extract goo from whales. I'm sure the goo had a name but I don't recall what it was, hopefully it was more thought inducing than..... Unobtainium. Sigh.This movie was to the original avatar, what ""the force awakens"" was to ""a new hope"". Same story, new names.The children were mediocre characters that were more annoying than necessary. The new tribe were a slightly greener color, otherwise they were the same as the tree tribes. Some new animals that were virtually the same as the last one, just water based.RatingsSpecial effects - 9 (3d in the Imax version was pretty meh, but the movie is very visually attractive).Story&characters - 1 (both give mediocre a bad name)
Plot - 1 (there isn't one)
Ending - 1 (There isn't one, this feels like an episode, not a movie)Overall - 4/10. 1 star removed due to the runtime which shouldn't have cracked 1.5 hours but is more than double the length, mostly to add more special effects to distract you from the lack of story/plot = 3/10."
As a HUGE james Cameron fan make that fans my wife and i were let down it started out promising but quickly became boring and the story to us seemed to be basically the repeat of the original just not as good. Part 3 looks to be more of the same this will not be anywhere near as successful as the 1st film and it took him 13 years WHY?? It had some brilliant scenes no doubt but after the huge success of the 1st film he should have pulled his HUGE EGO head out of his ass and made the sequel with 2 -3 years TOPS lord of the rings BLOWS this trilogy away already and it didnt take 13 years for part 2. I believe his perfection or OCD or whatever is so way beyond where it needs to be its creating a limited amount of product and with only 100 percent of his visions. He needs to move on from avatar and do it quickly I can tell you this part 3 will bomb!! It wont do 100 million domestically. On a final note him giving the middle finger to fans that boied cause he left without acknowledging them or giving autographs shows what a pompous jerk he us if it wasnt for THOSE fans you wouldn't have the life you have and YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AT THAT PREMIER!! WHAT A JERK!!
"As the long-awaited sequel to director James Cameron's 2009 megahit sci-fi/fantasy blockbuster, ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" has been one of 2022's most anticipated releases. And, for the most part, it's a visually stunning and modestly entertaining piece of cinema. But is it the masterpiece everyone has been anxiously waiting for? Hardly. While the film is long on style (it truly is gorgeous to look at), it comes up short on substance. The script is the main problem here, telling a tale that's not overly engaging or insightful (certainly much less so than its more compelling predecessor) and full of story threads that either regurgitate material from the original or borrow from a variety of other sources, both narratively and visually. Then there's the runtime, coming in at a whopping 3:13:00, far, far longer than it needs to be, especially in the overly protracted closing hour. The action sequences become a bit tiresome and gratuitous after a while, and other segments feel like a polished travelogue for the Pandora Chamber of Commerce. What's more, there are storylines left unresolved, making this a picture that can't fully live up to being a standalone entity (one of my moviemaking pet peeves). To its credit, though, the picture's pacing is surprisingly tolerable for a film of this length, and it makes excellent use of its 3D technology (perhaps better than any other movie in which I've seen it employed in recent years). Still, for an offering that's been 13 years in the making, I expected something a little fresher and more inventive than this. But, for those who can't get enough of this franchise, this installment should satisfy nicely. And, if not, fans can look forward to three more sequels scheduled to be released over the next six years (though I'm not sure how many of them I'll be seeing)."
"There's a moon that's called Pandora far away, its unique flora and its fauna hold the sway, keeping everything aligned, a rooted network gives a spine, but vengeful enemies return, to have their day. The indigenous in this place are called Na'vi, harmonious and peaceful and they're free, with Jake Sully as their chief, they have the power and belief, to force adversaries away and make them flee. But these invaders play their cards as Avatars, it gives them strength to match the locals and it jars, so Jake moves his family, away to islands out at sea, taking to the air, while traveling afar.101 years before Avatar The Way of Water was created, Charles Chaplin released what must have been to cinema goers at the time a work of amazement with 'The Kid', to this day one of the greatest pieces of film projected on a big screen. Comparing these two films is impossible, the advances in technology and the way images are presented today is mind-blowing. I left the cinema excited but a little sad, that I won't be around to see or experience what magic film lovers might absorb, and how they might absorb it in the year 2122, but I did feel overwhelmed at the incredible effects, the imagination, and innovations used to present an analogous story to ones lived out on a planet whose environment's not too dissimilar to Pandora. While the themes it transmits are by no means original or new in their translation, the way they are presented, over three hours that flies by, is truly awe inspiring and almost beyond belief.See it on the biggest screen you can, in 3D, and savour every moment of it."
"Not to say I did not like the first one cause I did, but it was not the best movie I ever scene, and this sequel is better than that.The story is actually not as tight as the original tale, but it's a better story. It just flows slower than the original. There will be a point for all of us where the story slows down enough to make you realize you have to go to the bathroom and that's how much you actually love the film. For me I think that was 12 or 15 minutes before the end credits rolled. That's pretty good.As a sequel we got a more Indepth look at the characters from the last movie, which included some surprising comebacks, and of course we got some new characters as this story is no longer about Jake Skully's adventure, but the adventure of the family he made snice we last saw him.What I found interesting is that the hole hoopla of the film is that its filmmaker James Cameron had to wait the 12 to 13 years for the technology capable to make this film. You could say the sign of a good director was that I could not tell what that technology was capable of, but I have to say, visually, that first film was far more outstanding than what I saw here.I did love the introduction of some new characters that brought us the new culture of the sea people, but in comparison to the original I was expecting a lot more underwater spectacular, I was expecting to see dozens of alien marine life, but Camren chose to concentrate this marine life to one creature which was not a bad idea cause it led so greatly to a well-formed story.I'll admit this adventure had a few loopholes that I think were done on purpose because we know the franchise is growing, but this second Avitar movie, not surprisingly worth that IMAX 3D ticket price in every way possible."
"'Avatar: The Way of Water' is the long gestating sequel to the mammoth hit from 2009 'Avatar', also directed by James Cameron. If this teaches us anything it is that more than likely you shouldn't bet against James Cameron as his high profile sequel soared to $1 billion dollars worldwide in only 14 days and, when all is said and done, will probably be one of only a handful of films to make over $2 billion. Despite a 13 year hiatus all of the principle actors return to reprise their roles including Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang and Sigourney Weaver. The film is a technical marvel and much of the delay was due to the need to actually develop the appropriate technology to allow filming Cameron's meticulous vision. At least one more Avatar film will be produced with the potential for more if they keep being successful.It is 12 years after the events of the first film and Jake Sully is the chief of his clan and lives with his wife Neytiri and their 3 children plus the adopted daughter of Grace's comatose avatar who's conception is a mystery. The daughter, Kiri, is also played by Sigourney Weaver who played Grace in the previous film. Another constant presence is a human boy called Spider who is a child of the deceased Miles Quaritch. The kid was too young to be put in cryostasis at the time most of the humans were expelled, and thus was allowed to stay growing up wild and much more Na'vi than human. Spider is, of course, practically inseparable from Sully's kids so you can see the potential for drama here. The ""Sky People"" as they are called have returned with the aim now being to colonize rather than plunder as the Earth is dying. The Sky People once again return with avatars of their own but this time instead of transferring a live human's consciousness into the avatar they were able to upload the thoughts and memories of deceased soldiers including the major antagonist from the first film Quaritch who serves as this avatar contingent's leader. On a raid Quaritch's avatars manage to capture Jake's kids including Spider. All of the kids are liberated except Spider who ends up begrudgingly aiding Quaritch. There is some sort of father son bonding that does occur, however, Spider remains predominantly loyal to his adopted Na'vi family. Jake Sully decides the best thing for the tribe is for him to take his family and flee. They eventually land with the reef people and need to learn the way of water to live there and be of use. There are growing pains for the family as they attempt to learn the ways of the new tribe. The children especially struggle as they don't fit in with the other kids. Of course Quaritch does not just let Sully and his family run and eventually tracks them to the reef people and begins a shock and awe campaign of violence to flush them out. The kids get captured again, and eventually a big showdown occurs, and of course with Cameron it is a spectacle of a showdown and while the side of right prevails, as one would expect, they do clearly leave room for the story to continue on.Cameron has clearly created a sumptuous visual feast with motion capture technology at the most cutting edge that it has every been, and I don't want to undersell the special effects as those special effects are why people are tuning in. It is why people are spending top dollar on premium seats at the best screens they can find because, story aside, this film demands to be seen in that format. Much like the first film 'The Way of Water' feels like all of the creative effort was put into the technical aspect of the film and the story is, for the most part, basic. In fact there are many very similar themes to the first story. As Jake initially needed to gain the trust of the forest people and bond with their mounts the family goes through the exact same trials when they get to the reef people. This film actually may take a step backwards with the plot due to some gaping plot holes that they just plow through with all their fancy effects hoping nobody is paying too close attention to things like the narrative. It is an incredibly bizarre shift that in the first film the human invaders were looking for the universe's most expensive mineral, and only 12 years later the Earth is dying so now finding a new home is the mission du jour. Somewhere in there they just managed to uncover a completely different substance that everybody is after, and there is no mention of the unobtanium that drove the entire plot of the first film. The other huge flaw is the main driver for this film which is Quaritch's pursuit of Jake Sully which seems very much like a vendetta from his past life although it is not framed that way. The story only casually mentions why so many resources are being exhausted to hunt down this former chieftain. The script does not make it clear whether or not the Sky People seek to inhabit Pandora along with the Na'vi or if the are seeking to destroy them or pacify them. I think ultimately the aim, for now, is pacification and they believe getting Jake Sully will somehow accomplish that although once his family goes into exile that makes zero sense. It is super frustrating to see such an impressive display and see the narrative squandered. I will give James Cameron all the credit in the world as he has made a movie that everyone believes needs to be seen in theaters on the big screen, and I agree with that sentiment. Due to the visual effects alone this is a special film, however, these films of his are never going to be great until he can really develop the narrative beyond these basic confines he has lain out while also making the story actually make sense with in the larger framework of the film. As with the first movie 'Avatar: The Way of Water' is a beautiful yet flawed ideal.Eric's Grade: B-"
"More artificial worlds are waiting for the masses. I still can not understand the hype. There is nothing special about both Avatar movies. They just look like a videogame or PIXAR movie. They are so successful because they are so simpel, that really everyone can follow the plot. Switch your brain off and forget everything else. It is just escapism. Some people would watch this 24/7, just to forget the world and themselves. James Cameron is the master of distraction. This is entertainment for the brainwashed masses. Their brains really need this silly movie. And of course it is also about the money, lots of money."
"What the f did I just watch? Avatar 2 is probably one of the most boring movies you will ever see. There is Zero plot, nothing happens throughout the entire movie, and as if that isn't really bad of itself, they somehow revived all of the characters from the first movie, on the same mission as in the first movie. The first one actually had a plot even though it was a really generic one, it is still much better than this. There is no excitement at all throughout the entire movie, it's basically one long, boring soap opera. The movie had so much potential, they have created such an exciting universe that could easily be made many more movies of but after a storyline like this one we are done with the avatar franchise."
"Seriously 8+ ratings??! Have we watched the same movie with the blue and green monkeys?This movie is a whole repeat of the first, nothing added. What was great is the first film? Not much but the few interesting aspects were strong. Pandora was something unseen before really coming out of a dream. The principle of avatars was also an interesting idea and well developed. Those two ingredients really made it an original addition to hollywood blockbusters. What is original in this second film? Nothing. More avatars, more pandora. Storyline is flat, and acting is poor. But of course picture and CGI are beautiful. But are CGIs really justify an additional movie? I dont think so. Sometimes it feels too much plastic texture and computer water. I still put a few starts because I respect the hard work of the team but this is definitely the worst movie of cameron."
"Well, that was.. something. Yes, like everybody else I agree: the visuals were stunning. That's why it's getting 1 star.I wasn't expecting anything from the story seeing as the story in the first movie was average but fun to watch. So I went in blind. It really felt like a next-gen video game and if it were a game I would've liked it more - I think. But for me it was just awful.Let me put it this way, if you are able to ignore the macho sexism and every tired trope, then you'll probably have fun. I couldn't. It was too much, too cliché, too cheesy, too stupid.Regarding the tired tropes, we have for example,the ""sweet little daughter who gets caught every time""""the weird ""freak"" who is strangely attuned to the nature and gets to show it off at the end""""the outcast who befriends another outcast and both get to redeem themselves""""the bullies picking on the new kids but hey, new kid saves them, so they're besties now""""The distant, stern father who is too tough to show his love for his kids in a healthy way""and so ond, and so forth. But the thing is, I didn't care for any of the characters because it simply felt empty. I didn't root for anyone and what the hell was up with their marriage?? No chemistry, no love?It also felt like the qriters didn't know what message they wanted to send, should it be a movie against whaling? Against genocide of indigenous people? About friendship? Nobody knows.And lastly, do the women actually have any dialogue except for grunting, screaming and looking like psychopaths? Honestly, it felt like they had maybe like 5 sentences or something. Jeezes."
"Possibly the longest movie i've ever watch in theater yet one of the most fascinating movie theater experience i've ever had in my life, Avatar: The Way Of Water is fun, emotional, and powerful, it hits all the notes perfectly, i never enjoy an adventure films specifically outside planet earth this much in a long time, the movie never stops amazed me not only in the details of all the visual and special effects, but the story of Avatar: The Way Of Water was just incredible, all of these characters are so well written, so well perform, and again i cannot say how much i'm still amazed by all the visual and special effects in this film and it basically 95% of this film was all freakin' CGI, it definitely some of the best ones i've seen, it's so detail and so good that not even one frame including the human where i found some CGI flawed, where i can see the green screen or the blue screen in the background just a little bit NONE of that!, everything is perfect, praise for all the effect team and they deserve all the awards for it, this is how you use a CGI in movie rightly people, back to the movie itself, James Cameron recently reveal that he had planned to make Avatar 6 and 7 and one of the sentence that he said was basically the only person that can make Avatar is him, and you god damn right, i don't think anybody can ever make an Avatar movie than the creator himself James Cameron, because The Way Of Water is simply go down as one of the best movie sequel ever made for me, yes, i like it even more than the first one, not only we got more characters on the film and specifically great characters, upgrade visual, i think a better far more superior story and again even though the villain of the movie still the same, somehow it works, we also got the world of water instead of forest world, now i'm not saying that Pandora isn't beautiful, but the world of water excited and amazed me even more, it's an 3 hours and 12 minutes of epic, with the first two hours being one of the most well paced also entertaining, emotional, and powerful build up, ended with an epic climax in the last hour that basically feels like a combination between both James Cameron Terminator and Titanic, lot's of emotion, solid, exciting, and epic battle, entertaining, and mind blowing, i love Avatar: The Way Of Water, it's simply top 10 movie of the year for me, never been so hooked up and locked in a 3 hours movie like this in a long time, it's like i was converted to the movie, it's spectacular, it's amazing, i don't mind if James Cameron will only do Avatar now, do not let anybody take over, Avatar: The Way Of Water is a superb sequel that fills with incredible performance by all the cast, amazingly detail visual and special effects, gorgeous looking film with gorgeous wild world, fantastic score and use of sound, fascinating story, a powerful journey with a lot of emotion and hearts to it, Avatar: The Way Of Water is perfect!, bring on the next one James Cameron!"
"Its a little disappointing if I'm honest. Even the much touted special effects didn't deliver the wow of the first film.The story is very very basic which leaves plenty of time to get fully emersed into the world of Pandora. Except after a time that world fails to deliver any great discoveries compared to the first film. It feels very much a repeat.What I really don't understand is why the movie had to run for three hours? Nothing is gained by doing this. It seems log for the sake of being long.Its entertaining enough to not be a waste of time and the big screen in 3d will be the best way to see it, as once the effects are diminished in the lounge room the story, or lack of it, will come to the fore :)"
"Oh boy... where do I begin?...""Good special effects do not a movie make"" - hey mr Cameron (or rather Cameleon? This is what you've become)The main ""stars"" said in a video/trailer that this movie is like the first but on steroids, or 100x more intense than the first one... but hey, what else should they say? They gotta promote it, right?Truth is, this is like the first (literally!) but on Alzheimer... or on drugs... Nothing makes sense, nothing matters anymore, like it did so much in the first one... the dialogues are excruciatingly poor, the scenes follow each other without any flow, just thrown there randomly... What happened to you dear James? Did you microdose with something? What the heck, man?!...The first movie was a literal book about how-to-make-a-grand-piece-of-art! Everything mattered, each line of dialogue, each vehicle, each ship, each animal, each character was well-defined, well-played and well-written. Here, aside from copying lines and gestures and even grunts of old characters, none of them matters anymore, there are no real emotions, no spirituality (except for some fake watered-down attempt)... just some good special effects, especially the underwater ones. Scenes don't flow harnoniously anymore, like they did in the first one, they're just thrown there one after another senselessly... like a bad soup or a bland dish made by a bored or angry cook (who got lazy after being given some Michelin stars).But these alone do not make a good movie.The music is inexistent, some rehash of old tunes from the first movie. Nothing carries the scenes, musically.The HFR does this movie even less of a service, since now it feels you're watching a reality show with Navi people, or a poor Navi-tional Geographic documentary...All in all... Hollywood is becoming more and more dumb... But perhaps it's just alright for the new generations that they want educated without real principles or values or spirituality..."
"I am really not sure why Avatar and its sequel are a thing. The first one became the highest-grossing movie of all time, and yet it made zero impact on culture what-so-ever. Just think of the momentum and impact movies like Lord of the Rings, Toy Story or even Twilight created. Regardless of whether you like them or not, one has to admit they made it possible that new genres entered the big stage, they created fanbases that span the whole globe and engage people up to today. But Avatar? At least here in Germany, the movie disappeared from the public conscious after it left theaters. It was a simple story, told in a new (at-that-time) interesting visual way. The story was also finished after the first movie. The humans lost, they left. The End.So I was very skeptical why they would do a sequel to the movie. Even people that liked the first one, cannot name any character beside the two mains. And this sequel is so hollow and devout of creativity and logic it is depressing. As I said, the first movie basically told a finished story. Cameron and two (!) other screenwriters had more than 10 years to come up with a new story. And what did they come up with? Humans invade the Navi-Planet. Again. They could have imagined a new, more nuanced villain. No. They bring back the same cartoonlishly evil guy. They could have added depth to Jack and Neytiri. No, they bring in new, underdeveloped characters, while the two mains become empty extras. Just imagine this: they were not even creative enough to give Neytiri an own personal memory with her eldest son, so instead she watches Jack's instead.The script in terms of dialogue and logic is not good. The ""logic"" of the story falls apart while you are watching it unfold. THe dialogue is hollow. Even the music is creatively bankrupt. James Horner, who died in 2015, wrote the music for the first Avatar. And he just copy-pasted the music he wrote for Apocalypto. And this rip-off is again being used here. It is not enough that the movie looks pretty. Many movies do. Yet they go beyond that and try to tell a compelling story. Avatar 2 is so empty, you forget about it in 2 days. Which is good I guess so you can enjoy the next part (should you decide to watch it), which will be the same story again."
"Avatar: The Way of Water is a phenomenal sequel that wisely chooses not surpass the original in scale and instead offers a more intimate tale focusing on revenge and the struggle to be a good father whilst still delivering some truly awe inspiring set pieces and advancing filmmaking technology like never before.Also, as it is well documented that it's supposed to be part 2 of a multiple film saga it's so damn refreshing that the film feels so self contained. It barely sequel baits, focusing exclusively on this story and has surprisingly genuine stakes as no one truly feels safe or guaranteed to make it out alive.Sam Worthington gives a better performance as Jake Sully this time around, with his character showing more maturity and a stoic nature. Zoe Saldana doesn't get as much to do this time around but still has her fair share of emotionally powerful moments.Stephen Lang as Quaritch was one the best parts of the original and here he somehow manages to be even better, bringing more of the expected ruthlessness and tough exterior as well as showing a more human side to the character that's unexpected but really works.All of the new, younger actors are superb. They carry their scenes really easily and fit in naturally so it doesn't bother when the film focuses on them opposed to the adults. The best performance is Jack Champion as Spider whose a joy to watch and is particularly impressive as the only practical element in a lot of his scenes.James Cameron's direction is incredible, the CGI is insanely detailed and real, improving vastly on a predecessor that honestly still holds up. He also once again proves that he's one of few filmmakers to actually understand 3-D and uses it to its fullest. He even makes the higher frame rate good for the most part which is extremely impressive.The 3 hour 12 minute run time definitely sounds imposing but surprisingly flies by thanks to excellent pacing, keeping the film constantly moving without feeling rushed and is a testament to how a film's pacing matters way more than it's actual length.The music by Simon Franglen is really good, it's not an easy task to follow in the footsteps of the late great James Horner and even if most of the score is just the old themes recycled it only proves how well they work at evoking the necessary emotions for their corresponding scenes."
"I will admit it. I am one of those people who are skeptical with the idea of having a sequel to the highest grossing yet forgettable, to some audience, of all time. That being said, I remained optimistic and hoped that it would at least be good. And boy was I surprised by this movie. The Way of Water was not only great as the 2009 technical masterpiece, but was somewhat, better than I expected.In this movie, it does follow the same formula like the first one: you have your first act that has a lot of exposition and information needed to be made, the second act which is basically world-building around a clan, and then the third act which is nothing more than full on actions and emotions felt. Just imagine this plotline but with more emotions on high, dazzling spectacles in the bodies of water and amazing fighting sequences - that is how the Way of Water felt for me. Not to mention unlike Avatar, I was already in for the ride just from its second act which was a plus for me.With regards to the cast, Sam Worthington as Jake Sully is greater compared to his acting from the original. I connected with him a lot more as a family man considering he puts his family as his first priority. Britain Dalton, for the most part, was a standout character especially his connection with a certain whale and how he struggles to step up like his father Jake. Stephen Lang as Quaritch was developed a lot better as a villain though his return still feels like a mixed bag alongside Sigourney Weaver's depiction as Kiri since she doesn't act like a teenager that much even though her character is interesting with regards her connection with Eywa. I wish I could see more of Zoe Saldana's Neytiri more in the next film if ever. And lastly, Jack Champion as Spider was difficult for me to understand as a character.But what I can say for the most part is that I was definitely enthralled by the visuals that James Cameron has done in almost 13 years of the film's production. I am inspired by him for how he was able to level up from the first movie and actually doubling down on the theme of environment. The water is definitely a great idea considering at this point of our lives, humans are also abusing the creatures and resources of the water. His activism does shine a lot and was not shoving down like other films with a social commentary would do. Not to mention there are scenes that remind you of his previous films like Titanic and even Aliens.Overall, I had an amazing time watching The Way of Water. For me, regardless of the same formula utilized from the first movie, the fantasy-sci-fi film shines by using a simple story and making it a cinematic experience. While I am skeptical of seeing more of this in the future, I encourage people to watch this film to support theaters and filmmakers that have a lot of passion in creating films and putting it out for the world to see.8.5/10 - Great."
"Honestly, your be better watching a David Attenborough documentary, it's far more interesting and no way near as boring. Most of the film is dire storytelling interspersed with overwraught battle scenes, you really need to switch off any common sense or scientific understanding when watching it. Basically Rambo level of stupidity.I need to write another 268 characters for some stupid reason, but really I just feel worse the more I think about this awful film. The first was okay, not fantastic but okay, this is just total garbage along the lines of the recent Alien movies, hopefully that is enough to convince you to save your money."
"Cameron minions will act as if they just watched the second coming of Jesus but this movie, just like its predecessor, is nothing more than smoke. If filmmaking is all about wide shots and technological achievement then yes it is the greatest movie of all time. Unfortunately, some people enjoy deeper movies, with strong narratives, great performances, deep themes. Avatar 2 offers none of that. James Cameron has once again achieved something unparalleled: another 3h+ movie with absolutely nothing of substance. Nothing. It's the same terrible outcome the first one offered wrapped in the most beautiful package. It's enough for some but I'd like to think those with a little more intellectual curiosity will see right through the joke this movie is: Dances with Wolves in Outer Space Part II, Dumber Edition."
"Avatar was a visual tour de force with the storyline borrowed from Dances with Wolves or is it Pocahontas.The belated sequel is another visual feast in 3D. It probably is the first 3D movie I have seen in years. At least James Cameron knows how to make the best out of the format as others do post 3D conversions.The 3D is brilliantly realised both in the jungle world and the sea world. Although you do wonder at times if you are watching a CGI motion capture animated movie or a live action one.The trouble is the storyline is hackneyed. I was reminded of the Matrix sequels where Agent Smith was brought back as the antagonist even though he was defeated in the first movie.Some of the movie did not even make sense. The Earth is dying and the Sky People have returned from Earth to colonise the moon Pandora. A year later ruthless Marine, Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) is resurrected as an Avatar of a native Na'vi along with others.Their job is to track down and kill Jack Sully (Sam Worthington) whose consciousness became part of a Na'vi Avatar body. He has been leading the resistance against the Sky People.Now Sully has to flee with his family to keep the forest tribes safe. He seeks sanctuary with an aquatic clan in the reef islands of Pandora.Given the Sky People had returned, some of them are hunting the Tulkin sea creature. You would have thought both people would had united to repel the prospective invaders. Not just for harvesting Pandora's resources but they are planning to repopulate it.At over 3 hours, this is a long movie. It is a kind of film you get the most out of in the cinema, I doubt I would watch it again on home viewing."
"James Cameron holds no punches in Avatar: The Way of Water, testing our characters to greater limits and how much we can see ourselves reflected in this epic tale of cultural identity and mother nature. This movie has a special place in my heart not solely because of the technological evolution on display, but because this is modern myth-making at its finest. I'm not going to go on a hyperbolic word spree but it was phenomenal. The best action paired with the best visuals I've seen in years. An amazing journey. The 3 hours flew by. I loved it and I can't wait to see it again this weekend. Man, what a film."
"I can simply put my opinion like this: Expectaions - My Opinion about the Movie - Disappointed
I am in an in between zone where i can't say that the movie lived to my expectations nor did it really disappoint me, however i still enjoyed it with the great visuals but being perfect made it a bit weird at times! Also the movie has a unique problem which i never encountered before which is a frames problem. There were cut und shots where you will see everyone moving faster than the previous shots with something being strange about it! Also discovering the world during the first half of the film and trying to amaze the audience with beauty of the visuals was waaaay too long during the first half of the film, then the second half of it the action started and it didn't disappoint. Don't miss the movie at the theater."
"As many others have said, the visuals and the imagination that went into the visuals is the best I have ever seen.The quality of them frankly just dominate the movie.The acting is good too.However, the story is just lazy, in my opinion, feeling like a shotgun appropriation of ideas central to American and Western culture.Want a little of the Vietnam War burning of villages there? Got it!A little of a Western vs American Indians with their arrows and war cries? Sure!A little military might and blind capitalism being mis-used to destroy traditional cultures and murder whales for economic gains? Done!Even a little New Zealand Maori tattoos and Haka? Just slip it in!All wrapped together in a neat parcel of David vs Goliath little guys beating the big guy.Maybe Cameron is showing us the most awful elements of Western culture, to shame us, or laugh at us? Or, maybe, he is just recycling familiar stories for us to pay for?Who know?"
"Avatar: The Way of Water begins similar to the first installment and then becomes this magnificent story about fatherhood and family; about loss, humanity, nature and of dangers of corporate greed that director-writer-producer James Cameron executes brilliantly. James Cameron used real world problems with the rainforest for the first film and here he does a similar thing but with poaching. It fits the story and the world so well of the Avatar franchise. You notice it as much with this film as its predecessor how big of a passion project it truly is for Cameron. Back then he brought us a whole new world to experience and ground breaking technology to witness. With The Way of Water, he does it again, showing more of Pandora through its sea tribes; meaning new culture, underwater sign language and the new technology in order to film performance capture scenes underwater, a feat never accomplished before.Jake Sully lives with his newfound family formed on the extrasolar moon Pandora. Once a familiar threat returns to finish what was previously started, Jake must work with Neytiri and the army of the Na'vi race to protect their home.Cast members Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldaña, Stephen Lang, Joel David Moore, CCH Pounder, Giovanni Ribisi, Dileep Rao, and Matt Gerald reprise their roles from the original film, with Sigourney Weaver returning in a different role. New cast members include Kate Winslet as Ronal; a free diver of the Metkayina and Tonowari's wife, Cliff Curtis as Tonowari; the chief of the reef people clan of Metkayina and Ronal's husband. Edie Falco as General Frances Ardmore; the commander in charge of the RDA's interests, and Jemaine Clement as Dr. Ian Garvin; a marine biologist. The Sully family have grown to include James Flatters as Neteyam; Jake and Neytiri's first son and oldest child. Britain Dalton as Lo'ak; Jake and Neytiri's second son. Trinity Jo-Li Bliss as Tuktirey (""Tuk""), Jake and Neytiri's eight-year-old daughter and their youngest child. But also an adopted teenage daughter called Kiri who's played by Sigourney Weaver, also Jack Champion as Miles Socorro (""Spider""); the teenaged son of Quaritch born in Hell's Gate (the human base on Pandora in the first film) who was rescued and adopted by Jake and Neytiri and ""prefers his time in the Pandoran rainforest"". The acting was mostly superb, except for Spider who was played by Jack Champion (a newcomer) although an important supporting character, his acting was ranging from good to bad, mostly average. But let's dig into the great performances, starting with Sigourney Weaver as Kiri, Jake and Neytiri's adopted teenage daughter. Just the idea of someone aged 73 is playing a teenager through motion capture, it shows her acting range, a brilliant performance. I expected Zoe Saldana to have more to do, but I think she'll have an even bigger role in the third film, she was terrific though and had one of the better performances. Sam Worthington and Stephen Lang were also phenomenal. The performance that surprised me the most were Britain Dalton as Lo'ak, what a great performance, truly. He has a future in the business. That's what I love about James Cameron, his casting. Like Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, but also giving Sigourney Weaver another role after her death in Avatar which was one great and memorable death but also a brilliant performance. I also found that The Way of Water had more emphasis on drama and acting, the longer run time is a reason for that, the actors really got to act, but also learning to free dive. The cast did most and some even did all the underwater stunts, which is impressive.James Cameron co-wrote the screenplay with Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver (who wrote Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and War for the Planet of the Apes), with a story the trio wrote with Josh Friedman and Shane Salerno. The writing is in my opinion quite great, mostly, my criticism is at the end of my review. The direction and James Cameron's hard work is one of the film's highlights like the previous film was. Having read interviews before and after having seen the film at the cinema, I've read how supportive and great he was at giving direction to the actors. It's his vision and visual storytelling that makes him one of the greatest. Not many have succeeded with sequels, James Cameron have done it again and again (Terminator 2 and Aliens), and now he did it with The Way of Water.The visual effects and CGI these days, these last couple of years, have been extremely bad in comparison to this film. Avatar: The Way of Water has scenes full of visual effects, each frame with so much to please your eye, scenes with so much going on that multiple rewatches is on my agenda. It's a treat for your eyes, a real eye pleaser. The groundbreaking technology and visual effects is two of the major things that made Avatar into the memorable and biggest movies of all time, along with a lot of other things. But Pandora, the mind blowing planet that are so easy to get immersed to, the Na'vi and everything that went into them. For this film we got to see the sea tribes and thus getting to see the new technology James Cameron helped create, performance capture in underwater scenes. This man have changed lifestyle during the first Avatar and the second, but one thing that haven't changed is his love for the franchise, his passion, a true master at work. I also want to praise the cinematography, Russell Carpenter (who won an Oscar for Titanic) does some brilliant work, photographing so many stunning looking shots with spectacular angles. Overall perfect. Cameron and him are a great duo, you see it in each scene regarding how it was shot. Also, the editing deserves some praise, music definitely needs it. Whilst James Horner is missed (having done the musical score for Avatar), Simon Franglen comes in and does an amazing job, giving us a score both gripping and emotional. He's a great replacement for the maestro, James Horner.I've heard people calling it too long and for me and my girlfriend, the 192 minute runtime felt right as time flew by quick. Scenes could have been trimmed, sure, but lots of the drawn out scenes of nature and overall slower pace is there for a reason. Character development, mostly for Kiri who is the spiritual in the family. I actually think the film could have been longer, but this length is perfect for the film. In the writing and overall story, I think The Way of Water is better in every way than its predecessor. Yet it have been criticized for having a thin narrative. Yeah sure it doesn't have this mind-blowing narrative, it's actually quite simple, but it works so well because of the visual effects and Pandora as we get to explore lands uncharted to us viewers. Thus the simplicity works here, it's a story about fatherhood. Like what Sam Worthington said in an interview; ""He could have quite easily told the story of Jake and Neytiri going on battling the wars,"" says Worthington (who, like Saldana, has three children of his own), ""but when you add in the kids and having to keep them safe, or not wanting them to emulate you because it can get them killed, they're operatic themes.""Avatar: The Way of Water currently has a critic score of 77% and an audience score of 93% on Rotten Tomatoes, a site I normally never visit, film critics have more knowledge of film than most audience. I think it's fair, but honestly, I love this film and agree with film organizations; organizations such as the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute named Avatar: The Way of Water as one of the top ten films of 2022. I agree with that, completely. Also worth noting is how the film also received numerous other accolades, including nominations for the Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Director at the 80th Golden Globe Awards. Avatar 3 is coming in 2024, I'm ready. The Way of Water was everything I wanted for a sequel, but more. It's a magnificent film, with groundbreaking technology and visuals, a true visual masterpiece."
"He's right. The motion capture, technology, cinematography, story, action sequences and phasing all great. One of the movies you must watch in your lifetime!! It's beautiful, touching and speak right into your heart...Cannot wait till the next movie is out. This will for sure break all the records. The Academy should recognize all the efforts put into making this movie. It's good that they took all the time they needed to make it. It gave us the right time to warch this movie with the mind blowing experience.PS: I'm a MCU and DC fan but now I understand why James Cameron said those things about the MCU...You got to see it to experience it. Highly recommend."
"Problems. This films got 'em. The main one being that James Cameron thinks that we all want to take a holiday on Pandora, a world that is nowhere near as cool as he thinks it is. Secondly, every character has turned into a blue alien now - even the bad guy. Jake Sully has a tonne of kids and they all look like him! There are so many identical looking characters I couldn't tell them all apart . Finally the plot is so simplistic and can be summed up as follows: Hour 1 - Hero has a family now and they are under threat. Hour 2 - Family runs away to hide and goes swimming. Hour 3 - Villains find them and there is a battle. The end. Save the Alien Whales is the ultimate message of this film - an ideal we have been aware of for 50 years. To remind us of this Cameron has to create a lot of evil Earth people who have somehow forgotten their own history. Could happen but ultimately you walk out being reminded not to do something you grew up knowing was wrong and Jim spent millions on this redundant message. The whole thing played like a crazy sequel to The Sound of Music where the Von Trapps run off to the Bahamas and get pursued by Nazi U-boats. Kate Winslet totally disappeared and I'm not even sure which character she played. Sigourney Weaver however was excellent as usual and her character stood out in a literal sea of CGI clones."
"I loved how beautiful it was. The CGI and cinematography is a work of art. Also, I saw it in the cinema which everyone should absolutely do! But the plot was such a snooze fest. Just insert any classic sequel plot - here's your hero, they've grown up, have a family, and there are some bad guys, the heroes are threatened, they have to fight back yada yada. I mentally clocked out a couple times only snap back into it and realise nothing had happened. At least the Aussie guy was entertaining.Also it is looooong. So maybe that didn't help things. I can imagine watching this at home with an interval in between and enjoying it more.Go see it for the visuals. Just don't prepare to use your brain understanding the story."
"I'll admit that there's a lot that I forgot about with Avatar 2009. I remember not really being that impressed either. I mean, it was a very well done movie and Jame Cameron never fails to satisfy it seems but I just didn't think it was as good as his previous masterpieces.Avatar Way of Water was VERY visually awesome!! And was very entertaining and had me on the edge of my seat. Great movie. It was a little long but overall, my wife and two daughters loved it as well. It had a great message and great acting by all. We saw it in 3D and that was awesome as well and highly recommended. Go see it.. I mean, you have to right?"
"It's been a long, long wait, it's taken forever, when I think of where I was back in 2009, it's a whole new world, James Cameron takes us back to Pandora, to pick up the story.If you're wanting a hugely deep and meaningful story, you may be a little disappointed, as the plot itself is thin, and hot too dissimilar to the last, but, if you want an epic cinema experience, I would recommend Avatar 2.The visuals, nothing short of spellbinding, I would be astonished if this film doesn't win an Oscar for the visuals, they are truly staggering. It's so bright and vibrant, I saw it in 3D, I'm not sure I'd recommend that over a regular viewing, that's my plan for tomorrow.It was long, but it's one of those films that moves on by quickly, I didn't fidget or shuffle about, meaning I was engrossed in the story.At times it's a little corny, and some of the dialogue will make you want to roll your eyes, but in the context it's a minor irrigation. There was a degree of predictably and inevitability about it, but who cares.I see the new one comes out in 2024, so not too long to wait.I enjoyed it, if I'm honest id hoped for a bigger plot, 7/10."
"To say I'm disappointed is an understatement. This should have been much better than it was. This was basically a rehash of the first movie's plot with added family drama and a switcheroo of who was becoming an avatar.First off, since when did they start growing avatars with human imprints in case someone dies? I thought avatars were piloted by humans and the only reason Jake was different was because their god chose him to be in that body. That part felt completely hamfisted into the film and seemed like an excuse to get some original cast members back.Secondly, where the hell did the human kid come from? There was no mention of him in the first film that I can recall and also seemed completely forced into this already bloated story. I enjoyed some of the extra family drama and characters. It added an extra layer and, to me, that's all it needed. Apparently, not according to James Cameron, who felt the need to bloat this film out to over 3 hours long for seemingly no reason at all other than to stroke his own technical ego. I couldn't help but sit there during certain sequences and think, this really did not need to be in this film and could've been cut with no consequence to the plotline whatsoever.Speaking of plotlines, did I mention this film is essentially a copy and paste effort from the first? They have to leave their island because they are being attacked and they go and learn the ways of the water people, similar to Jake Sully in the first film learning to live with the Na'vi. Then we have some drama here and there, and it all narrows down to the big showdown at the end. In that, I feel like the film lost the storytelling magic that occured in the first film. Also, not having any sort of romance or love story kinda killed the passionate feeling you get when you watch Jake and Neytiri mingling in the original. There is no feeling of love in this film other than the love for family, which basically makes it The Fast And The Furious with water beasts instead of muscle cars.My last gripe that I'll share with you is that it seemed like the creatures in this film were gentrified compared to the first. They all acted like humans for the most part, and lost their native ways and actions in favor of the screenwriter trying to make us connect with the characters, but it honestly had the opposite effect. It made me bored of them almost immediately and generally lost my interest throughout.Now, onto the reason why I rated this a 6 and not a 3. The special effects were outstanding! The IMAX 3D presentation was sublime. Definitely the best use of 3D I think I've seen on screen since the original. I also enjoyed that the entire film filled the screen, instead of films like Top Gun or Marvel movies that only utilize the technology for their action sequences and everything else(80% of the film) is presented with black bars.But here's the kicker for the visual effects that I think Cameron failed with. His use of fast framerate technology. The near constant switching between 60+ frames per second to 24 fps was jarring to say the least. I wished he would've just chose the 24 fps for the whole film. As a gamer who games on a pc with a 240hz monitor, the 60+ fps made it feel like I was watching cinematics from a video game instead of a movie. Some of it I thought looked fantastic, but most of it made me feel like grabbing a controller because it was basically a cut scene from a game. Took me out of the immersion, unfortunately. I do commend him for trying, but I wondered if he actually watched the final product himself and saw how strange it was on the big screen.Overall, it's not a bad movie if you're going to see some cool 3D and wonderfully realized, hyper-realistic animation. Just expect more of the same with this sequel, as opposed to the evolving we would expect from a 13 year production.3 blue beings out of 5."
"What a ""none- movie""!! The story is so shallow as to be nonexistent. The characters and the dialogue are weak. Everyone hypes about the ""visuals""? Really? A top tier director with a budget of a billion dollars should be praised for producing good visuals? You can get that on an Xbox game. It's like saying the toilet water was almost as blue as the sea, it was so visually stunning. My teenage son was bored beyond belief and couldn't believe I made him sit through over 3 hours of nothing!! Nothing intelligent. Nothing moving. Nothing memorable. Another over indulgent and over hyped Director serving up meaningless video game content."
"I watched the first Avatar out of curiosity and I must admit, I appreciated the imagination put into the creation of the initial world. I hated the new age message though and wasn't planning to see any more episodes but, you see, I'm married to a boy who enjoys the visuals, so...... we went to the second Avatar but even my husband was bored after an hour because what we have here is, first of all, a story badly told. In terms of scriptwriting but also - of cutting. The scenes seem randomly ordered, more like for a gallery exhibition rather than for a coherent plot: now, I'll show you this, and now, please, look at that.Second of all, there's no logic neither to the character development, nor to the story itself. Where, for example, comes the rivalry between the two brothers from? We hear of it in a brief exchange between them but that is all. There is no accumulation, no nothing.Why does the little brother feel like a such an outcast as to associate himself with a giant killer fish?An why, the hell, does the killer fish happen to not mean being a killer fish after all? Are we some kind of kids who cannot bear a morally stained character?Why is the big brother left without a story whatsoever? Ah, yes, because of the same reason - the big brother is the only one of importance who dies and we, as the kids we are, cannot bear the death of someone we know, let alone - someone we sympathize with...Storywise, what are the earthlings doing on Pandora anyway? Trying to inhabit it, or take this magical fish juice as to stay forever young? And why focus on one indigenous enemy when the planet is obviously full of armed tribes?Plus, nothing new is added to the alien world - we see the same creatures with the same features but this time - more adapted to water.The message is a chaos. Not that it makes it any less pertinent to just one side of the political spectrum though. The anti-imperialist struggle is somehow combined with tribal values, allowed to some but denied to others. The absurd pacifist whales still need to eat smaller fish to survive and in nature they will definitely choose a weaker victim to guarantee their success. But somehow when we humans do the same, we are monsters from hell and this movie tries to make us rejoice when we see our spices destroyed.Twisted much?Definitely don't count me for a third episode."
"Avatar: The Way of Water is the cinematic equivalent of a wet fart. It's a bloated, overhyped, and derivative mess that leaves a bad taste in your mouth. The plot is as thin as the CGI is thick, and the characters are about as deep as a kiddie pool. The dialogue is cheesy and cringeworthy, and the acting is about as convincing as a politician's campaign promises. The special effects are about as groundbreaking as a flip phone, and the 3D is nothing more than a cheap gimmick to hike up ticket prices. In short, Avatar: The Way of Water is a cinematic travesty that's about as enjoyable as a root canal. Save your money and watch paint dry instead. Trust me, you'll thank me later."
"James Cameron FINALLY releases the highly anticipated sequel to the wildly ambitious and visual masterpiece Avatar. While some may have completely forgotten or just lost interest in another film after waiting years and years, this film truly does deliver nearly the same ambience and excitement. At times there are some aspects that become a little more predictable and cliché but the visual prowess is just too magnificent to deny and once again the driving force in this spectacle. Cameron creates settings that are phenomenally breathtaking while bringing the heart pounding action. The emotional parts are still prevalent and help with the overall product. The voice acting and motion capture is once again terrific. Powerful symphonies ensue in the score. Overall this is a fantastic sequel though can meander slightly. Let's just hope the next sequel comes before another 13 years ..."
"Most filmgoers have spent the past decade in agreement that 'Avatar' was okay, but rather clichéd and definitely not deserving of the biggest box office gross of all time. At the time, the special effects were astonishing, zipwiring over the uncanny valley in a way which had never been done before.Of course, now we see that standard of CGI everywhere from video games to the cat in 'Toy Story 4'. So we have to focus on the aspects of filmmaking other than sheer spectacle.It would be very easy to dismiss a film simple because it's popular and expensive, but reviewing this film on its own merits I thought the opening was strong and had the potential to be a very gripping film. It started to falter when the villain from the first film was brought back to life in a new body and immediately started attacking people in his confusion. He is then sat down and forced to watch a video of his human self explaining (and barely understanding) that his memories have been saved so that if anything happens they can be uploaded into a new avatar.The sensible thing to do would have been to save his memory after he's already been told this, so that when the avatar/clone wakes up it would already know what's happened and wouldn't go on a confused rampage.The special effects are very impressive, but the film very slowly becomes a remake of the first film, only set on the coast rather than in the forest. Does anyone care? Is there anything to be gained that wouldn't be from watching the first film again?The twist this time is that Jake has four children and the baddie is planning to cause Jake suffering while also killing off the entire Na'vi race. So when the villain captures threePicture a scenario: you're the most evil man in the world and you're planning to commit genocide, specifically hoping to cause suffering to one man. Then three of his kids come to you, your henchmen take them hostage and you try to use them to lead you to their dad. Instead, they resist you and repeatedly call you a butthole.What do you do? You'd kill or torture one of them so the others would be terrified and do your bidding, right? Well, in this film nobody ever seemed to want to hurt the kids and even the bullets almost always avoid them.So you quickly realise that nobody significant is going to get hurt in the first two hours of the film, by which point you are bored senseless and thinking this will end up being a 4/10. But to make it even worse, the third act is a shameless merger of 'Avatar' and 'Titanic' - if they each became the highest grossing film of all time, why not remake them together? Who cares about integrity, originality or storytelling, right?Not only that, but some scenes are direct remakes of 'The Abyss'. When you've made some big movies, do you feel obliged to just redo the same things? If was incredibly boring to watch.The thing to ask yourself with a sci-fi movie set on another planet (or moon) is: if this were set on earth would I care, or is there something integral to the story which means it must be set on another world? The answer in this case is neither. It would have been very easy to swap those birds for horses and all the other animals for terrestrial animals. What you'd have is an incredibly boring movie. For some people, the visuals might be enough to distract from the lack of substance. I wasn't convinced.The plot holes were glaring. Early on, we discover that everyone knows they can connect these jellyfish to their backs and breathe underwater. So all the characters who drowned could have easily been protected. And it's not as though they have any objection, since the entire world is tailored to fit humanoids. Even the animals they ride have evolved to have a handle on the back and a port to connect their tails.And what are we to make of the character who is supposed to be heroic for spearing fish, then ten minutes later he's judging other people for harpooning a whale's fin. These people 'are connected with nature' only so far as they can see human-like life in the animals they're using. We're told it's wrong to kill a whale because they're very intelligent and can appreciate music - but any other animal is fine to be used. This leads to one random scene where the baddies extract the elixir of life from a dead whale, which is never mentioned again. If there's a material which can stop human aging, would that not be the villains' motivation for everything? Forget about revenge on Jake, you could live forever.The plot makes no sense. The characters are either one-dimentional or have no dimensions or thought whatsoever. The dialogue sounds like it was written by an algorithm, the plot is self-plagiarised, the acting is... well, let's just say it's a good job Zoe Saldana is there, because nobody else was even trying. The main character doesn't even react to a major tragedy in his life.And the absolute lowest point has to be when Spider swims past dozens of dying morally grey characters in order to save a genocidal dictator simply because... no, there's no explanation given. Even the character doesn't give any indication of why he did so. The only reason anybody could possibly give for saving the villain is to make three more shameless sequels.A 1/10 film could potentially become a 3/10 based on its visual prowess - were it not for the case that this is such a shameless cash-grab with not a shred of originality. Still, the nostalgia value will appeal to some and six months from now this film will have taken $1.7bn and be the 7th highest grossing film of all time. Shameless."
"Let's jump right in and talk about the visuals. They are, to the full extent of the word, unbelievable. I was in complete awe throughout the movie. The details are ridiculous. A new standard has been set.I have to gush a little more. The original Avatar had groundbreaking visuals, but The Way of Water is MILES ahead. I couldn't imagine how much better it could get. And there are hundreds of stunning shots and beautiful images. As South Park taught us, James Cameron is always raising the bar.As for the overall movie, I thought it was pretty awesome, but not as good as the first (8 stars). I was more emotionally invested in the story for the original. I remember being legitimately angry at the sky people.And while the first one is so fast-paced, this one slows down drastically in the middle portion. It's still enjoyable but we stray from the main story and fill it with less important stuff like bullying drama. I think it was also slowed down by maybe showing off a little too much with the visuals. The original had a great balance of story and showing off.I had a great time with this chapter and look forward to more. I'm not entirely sure 3D is worth it, but IMAX is a must since the entire movie has an expanded aspect ratio. (2 viewings, opening Thursday IMAX 12/15/2022, IMAX 2/7/2023)"
"After flinging the humans out of Pandora (apart from a few friends who remained) the Na'vi settled back into idyllic life. Jake and Neytiri now have a family - two teen sons, a young daughter, a teen daughter (who is actually the mysterious daughter of Sigourney Weaver / Grace's avatar), and a human lad called Spider who was too young to be packed into cryosleep. Then, guess what? The humans arrive back in force for a bit more planet-scale rape. And this time they are accompanied by a batch of avatar marines whose leader is implanted with the mind and memories of Quaritch, the baddie from the first film, who has a grudge against Jake. When it becomes clear that this squad is hunting Jake and family, the small griup flees the forest and takes refuge with a clan on an island.The story of Avatar came in for criticism because of being derivative, and a similar criticism can be levelled here. The story is adequate, but we've seen it before. Having said that, the film is over 3 hours long and doesn't drag. It does take some time for the new young characters to be distinguished from each other, but we know them by the end. The film is essentially a retread of its predecessor, but with major changes in location/milieu and the added complications of family at risk. For me, that was plenty for me to be invested with.As before, the visuals are absolutely outstanding. The world of Pandora is, again, completely immersive, and even more so given that a large part takes place in and under the water this time. The action is terrific.There is a major plot point which is brought up and then left unresolved. Because this film ends halfway through. And I'm already looking forward to the next part."
"Visuals are the main highlight. Saw it in 4dx 3d. Incredible CGI and effects. Story was a let down. Old wine in new bottle. Felt like they were reusing the first story at many places. They had like 13 years and still couldn't develop the story properly. Found some plot holes which contradicts the first movie. There were also many cliché scenes. And felt like the ""humours"" guys in the boat were bad actors. Took me out of the movie. Runtime was too much coz I felt bored. Overall it's an average movie. Still one time watchable. First movie is better in terms of story n visuals. This movie didn't have that balance."
"First off, I'm a HUGE fan of James Cameron, and not just his biggest hits, I also recognize The Abyss as a brilliant film. So I was obviously waiting impatiently for over 10 years to see this. The first Avatar was a visual feast with a story that served it well enough to draw us in and make us care once the action (and deeply subversive message) of the third act hit. Now that we're already familiar with Pandora and the characters, I was hoping this one would build upon that story, while also introducing a new villain, raising the stakes, and pushing the subversive message further, but no... that's not what happens. (I won't spoil it, but if you've seen the film you know what I'm referring to here.) This just felt like a lazy script that was thrown together quickly so they could spend the majority of their time on the visual FX, which don't get me wrong, are absolutely jaw-dropping. I gave the film 5/10 almost entirely for that reason.It's worth seeing in the theaters for the visual experience alone, but I'm disappointed because I expected so much more from a master like James Cameron. I was so bored and had such little investment in the characters by the third act that I actually found myself laughing at moments that were supposed to be heartfelt. (""Noooo! She was my soul sister!"")If I wanted a CGI theme park ride with a lazy story, I'd go watch a Marvel movie. You can do better than this, James. I mean, come on, you have to put more in than ""Ok... same basic plot as the first one, but now we're underwater..."" And the dialogue of the teenagers... I get that their father is originally from Earth, but they are growing up in a village on another planet full of those who aren't. They're not going to go around saying ""bro"" every other word. That's just lazy, sloppy writing. I'm really hoping he puts more into the script of the next one, if he really does plan on making more of these."
"As a huge fan of Avatar 1 which literally revolutionized 3D viewing I'm utterly disappointed with the soulless, plotless visual sensation.. Hoped Cameron wouldn't mess it up a sequel of a masterpiece.. After all he is human.. Avatar 3 must be a kickass else this franchise will be buried in time.. With the expectations and precedence set by 1st and bottomless pit shown lack of imagination in 2nd part definitely you got your work cut out..Come on James let your testosterone driven wild creativity do it's magic once again like good old days when you had it in you.. Don't torture audience with this imbecile graphical experiment!!"
"On my 10 year old son's persistent demands, I watched #AvatarWayOfWater yesterday evening. I was interested too but not as much as my son. There is enough feedback online on the movie being long, monotonous etc. Here I am presenting my views on the movie. Hope it is interesting enough.I watched the 3D, English version of the movie even though other languages were available. The only reason was that regional languages usually mess up the translation of English movies. What I have seen is that the feedback of negativity has largely come from people watching other languages.The movie starts off where the first part ends. Jake Sully has amalgamated into the Navii community and is leading a happy life with his wife and children. But, that is about to end when the Sky force comes back with greater power and in the Navii form to extract revenge by eliminating Jake Sully. Jake realises that this time, victory would not be easy and so runs away from his forest community to seek refuge in the water world clan of Naviis. The rest of the movie is about whether Jake succeeds and what price he ends up paying for success.Before I talk about VFX, I have to comment on the skill with which James Cameron has given space to emotions. For all its VFX, Avatar 2 is an extremely emotional movie about a family's fight for its existence. The skill with which he uses VFX to tell this story is amazing. The movie has huge VFX portions, but it does not take your attention away from the storyline or emotions.The VFX indeed is pathbreaking. I had seen the first Avatar in one of the largest IMAX screens in the world in US and I had great expectations therefore on the second one and believe me, it did not disappoint me. The climax portion of around 35-40 minutes indeed takes your breath away. The underwater visuals are so skilfully done that you become a part of the movie itself. You literally feel the water on your skin.Just don't believe any of the negative reviews. Simply go and watch. Its a long movie no doubt and you need some level of patience to dig into the movie. Believe me, its not time wasted."
"It's a good movie overall but certainly not the emotional epic that it seems its director wants to believe it is. The visuals are stunning but the story is heavy handed again and lacking in depth. If your story includes dialogue like the following then it lacks emotional depth: ""BRO. We've got to go now!"" ""I know cuz, I'm coming!"" ""Ok bro!"" It's still worth seeing in the theater for the visuals and the action sequences. And honestly the movie doesn't feel like it's over 3 hours. It's just disappointing that they couldn't come up with better dialogue and story than this in 13 years. I'm hoping now that they have the effects in place for the next films, maybe they can spend their time crafting effective stories and dialogue to accompany the fantastic visuals. This is a good but not great movie and one that I probably won't go out of my way to see again. Contrast that with Top Gun: Maverick, a film that was made with half the budget but lots of heart and fantastic action. I'd love to see that one again."
"I think we all need to accept that James Cameron is not a good director. He likes aliens, water, sinking ships, and expensive movies. The guy doesn't have much range.I don't like the first. My wife somehow loves it. I only went to see this because she wanted to, but multiple times during the movie I wanted to walk out or shout ""are you serious?""I have a lot of issues with this.1) They say bro so many times. It's annoying.2) Sigourney Weaver is great, but voicing a kid is weird.3) Jake Sully likes to make these profound statements that are completely ironic. ""Sully's stick together"" yet the family constantly gets separated or the siblings watching each other don't. ""Father's protect"" yet he's leaves his best chance at protecting his kids behind. He leaves an army he LEADS that defeated and killed the villain already.4) Death clearly doesn't matter because the bad guy is back. Sigourney Weavers character is basically back too. Do they just plan to make the generic army guy the villain in all of these? Cone on. If it wasn't 15 years in between these we'd all be mad.5) They say it took so long to make because of the visuals. That's a lie. Looks the same as the first. Some scenes look like a crappy 2010s video game. Telltales Jurassic Park had better underwater visuals. I also heard someone say this had better visuals than Aquaman. No way. Aquaman looked fantastic. This is crap.6) Spider is a weird character. He's like 16 maybe but he's still a child. Yet he's nearly naked. It's creepy.7) Spider is ""family"" only when convenient. Mtiple times they forget about him or leave him behind.8) The second hour drags. So boring. This movie is already too long.9) Characters are only smart or remember things when it's convenient. At one point they need to get around Fire on the water. I don't understand how this is an issue. Swim under it. They hold their breath super long. It's not an issue. Summon those water animals like you did 5 minutes earlier. Swim under. Summon your flying creatures like you did 80 times and fly over. This is plan dumb.They are also afraid to drown in a boat, yet they are all insane swimmers who can hold their breath really long.Spider saves his dad, only to later leave him for a family that left him behind and threatened to kill him?????They go to attack the humans with a bunch of Navi but don't. Then a whale thing attacks and now the Navi are all gone??? They just disappear.Multiple times in this they say Jake and his family are being hunted. They go somewhere else and as for sanctuary. They are then attacked by humans multiple times, yet in the final battle the Chiefs wife says ""you brought them here"". No crap. That's been established like 10 times.There's a ton of other things I didn't like but 15 years for this????? Crap. Give the money to someone else. When the Marvel movies don't rush CGI, it's just as good as this. James Cameron sucks."
"Today watched Avatar The Way of Water in IMAX 3D. After very long time seen an movie in theatre with excellent visuals. It's really worth to watch this movie in 3D. Pandora looks so real and amazing. James Cameron sets very high standards with each of his movie. To create complete water world with ocean creatures is a joy to watch. Sam, Zoe, Kate and all cast did good job in their role. This sequel is worth and waiting for other parts. Whole theatre was immersed in the visual spectacle and at the end of the movie everyone are still sitting and watching rolling credits. Don't miss it, go and watch it in 3D, 4DX, IMAX or Dolby theater 👍🏼"
"My Review - Avatar: The Way of Water
My Rating. 10/10Avatar: The Way of Water written directed and produced by James Cameron is the perfect example of a movie that deserves to be seen on the biggest and most high definition Cinema Screen you can find .We saw it on our local GMAX screen and for any movie that has a running time of 3hours 12 minutes to hold this movie goers interest it has to be special.Watching Avatar : The Way of Water on a television screen or tablet of any size would be an insult to the technology geniuses involved in the production and James Cameron's vision .It's been worth a 13 year wait between the first Avatar movie that broke all box office records becoming the top box office lifetime grossing movie of all time earning over $ 2.8 billion .I think one reason for Avatars great success is it's humanity ,which may sound odd as most of the film we are watching non human characters but the characters are warm and vulnerable with many values that we could well duplicate on our own sick planet, especially natural conservation and respect for our declining species of plants and animals.I was a bit doubtful about this sequel after being so underwhelmed by the Black Panther: Wakanda Forever sequel but The Way of Water is one of the most memorable and beautiful movies of the Fantasy Action Adventure genre I've ever seen.In this sequel we get to visit two wonderful worlds for the price of one of beginning in Pandora the Forest Kingdom then moving to the beautiful Kingdom of The Reef People . Jake Sully his partner Neytiri and their children have to flee their Forest Kingdom . They decide it's their only option after being hunted down by Quaritch a hybrid guerrilla Commander with the blue appearance of a Pandoran Na'vi to camouflage their intent and plunder Pandora .s Jake ( Sam Worthington ) leave their forest home behind to seek asylum with the tribes of the Metkayinan Reef people.The Sky invaders have returned to Pandora to colonise the Forest Kingdom due to Earth dying from neglect, overcrowding and lack of conservation does that
sound familiar? Earth today is spending billions of dollars on Space exploration to find intelligent life and suitable conditions for human habitation when we eventually ruin our own planet.There are many similar parallels and situations for humankind to identify with in this movie ,especially the suspicion and lack of acceptance of cultures other than our own . In this case the Reef People who have reason blame Jake Sully for bringing danger and conflict to their Paradise .It is a Paradise of beautiful undersea plants and fantastic creatures on the Metkayina reef including the Tulkun ,giant whale like creatures native to the Oceans of Pandora who possess their own names and culture as well as sophisticated music and poetry.The Tulkun play a vital role in the movie when they are hunted by the Sky invaders from earth to draw Jake Sully out of hiding.Avatar -The Way of Water already holds a number of production records I was interested to read that Kate Winslett who plays Ronal the partner of Tonowari the chief of the Metkayina Clan broke Tom Cruise's underwater Mission Impossible underwater filming record of 6 minutes when she swam underwater for 7minutes and 14 seconds.Also Avatar :The Way of Water is now the 7th film in history with a production cost of over $300million it's estimated the forthcoming sequels which are being filmed back to back will cost approximately $ one billion ,
There will be new worlds to discover in the future Avatar series as it's divided into 4 nations The Water Tribe, Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation and Air Nomads so we have many visual experiences ahead of unless James Cameron ends the Avatar series after the third movie if The Way of the Water isn't profitable.I doubt he has any worries in that direction as Avatar : The Way ofWater is the epitome of what great cinematic art is all about great skill and great talent but most importantly great vision I hope it succeeds .Special mention to Jack Champion who was very impressive in his role of Spider the young boy left behind in Pandora he plays a real Jungle boy captured by the guerrilla invaders for interrogation in their quest to destroy Jake Sully .Please don't wait for it to stream or the Blue Ray see it at a cinema ."
"The film premiered today here in Finland, and as a fan of James Cameron, I went to see it immediately. The version I saw was 3D HFR from the best possible screen in Helsinki.When the first film came out in 2009, I was sure 3D was going to be the future of cinema. Even with it's poor storyline, Avatar was quite good film in my opinion. However, as it turns out, 3D films have been thing of the past for few years. Peter Jackson's The Hobbit -films tried something new with high frame rate. While I liked HFR 10 years ago, I haven't seen any HFR films since. So I can't be the only one thinking if 3D HFR is not being appreciated these days by audiences?Visually Avatar: The Way of Water looks stunning. The effects are unbelievable, especially underwater scenes. HFR works a lot better than it ever worked on The Hobbit films. 3D is amazing, as it was in the first film. 3D is in fact so good I hope it comes to fashion again. This film is without a doubt a technical milestone in moviemaking. I just wish the movie would be good too.It's been 13 years since the first movie came out. James Cameron had more than ten years to perfect the script. There were five people credited for making the story of the film, and of those five, three were credited for screenplay. You would think that in such a long time so many people could figure out how to make a film without script being a big pile of crap.What follows are small spoilers, so be warned.This film's story is basically the same one as the first movie. How it it so is beyond me, as the first film was also blamed for poor script. Basic storyline is that the bad skypeople are a threat, the na'vi cry a bit for their animals, nature and Eywa and in the end they fight the bad skypeople. In between the film is basically about some na'vi kids swimming in the sea, chilling with the whales.In the first film skypeople were in Pandora to mine some metal, now what they are after is basically whale brains that stops humans from aging. That's cool, but since that was told, it wasn't relevant to the story. I would've liked to see some rich guy getting his whale-brain-juice to stop himself aging. A character like that could've made a good villain. Now the villain is the same Quaritch guy as in the first film. A villain so mediocre is maybe not a good thing trying to make what, 3-4 films?The movie lasts over 3 hours. Don't get me wrong, I'm one of the few people who do not mind seeing a long movie. But for that, movie has to have a good script. The script is just poor, and the movie is filled with long, beautifully shot scenes of na'vi kids exploring Pandora's sealife. You don't care for any of the characters, and Jake Sully feels like a side character. James Cameron has wanted to make a film that is a technical marvel. It's sadly only thing what this film is. What he should have done is to cut 30-45 minutes of the films lenght to save the film. Now it's just too long movie that feels like a very well animated video game story animation.The film itself is in my opinion 4/10 stars. Technically it's 10+/10, so for just that, you should see it in theaters, especially in 3D HFR."
"I wasn't excited for the second part but made my mind to watch it. The right decision I made was to watch it in cinema as it is wholly cinematic experience. You will not enjoy this movie on television or mobile. The visuals are stunning but it feels same as the first part. The story, for me, was little bit weak. It was mere copy paste of the first part except that the story took place in island instead of jungle.Movie's runtime also felt little bit long but given that we were given new info about the islands and there people, the long runtime was justified. James Cameron as a director did good job as always.Overall, it was a good movie (not great) and I would recommend you to watch it in cinema if you want to really feel/ enjoy it."
"Welcome back into the media cycle, James Cameron. Sometimes divisive with critics but always pushing forward, Cameron has often dragged the cinema kicking and screaming into the age of digital wizardry. His contributions to the medium have been rewarded by audiences repeatedly, adored by a burgeoning demographic in the eighties and frequently breaking box office records since releasing Titanic in 1997. But lo! Avatar: The Way of Water may buck the trend - rather than gross the GDP of Suriname, the film may only gross the GDP of Belize - a pittance.The film follows the continuing lives of Jake Sully and Neytiri. When marines return to seek revenge and use Pandora as a second Earth, the couple must flee from their forest home and into the water of a coastal tribe. There, they must learn to adapt to their new home as Colonel Miles Quaritch, cloned and in an avatar body, searches for their whereabouts.Avatar 2 is an impressively large and extraordinarily long film, but there is one constant which is unwaveringly distracting - the high frame rate. Talented filmmakers like Cameron, Ang Lee, and Peter Jackson, occasionally allow hubris to misguide them in their quest for innovation and cutting-edge superficialities.To this end, all three are desperately trying to incorporate a higher frame rate into their films, which is said to make look film more ""realistic,"" a supposition I've never understood. How does an artificially inflated frame rate, the most standardized metric in art, look more natural to viewers who are accustomed, throughout their entire lives, to the previous standard? I humbly speak for the film-going public when I answer, ""it does not.""
Avatar 2 further innovates by switching between (perceived) twenty-four and forty-eight frames per second. Although audiences are gifted less high frame rate, the technique only further distracts, as the film schizophrenically cuts between expected motion and horribly smooth action. It's also bound to greatly confuse those who notice the difference but aren't in the loop as to why or how. If the practice, inconceivably, becomes the standard, I may never see another blockbuster. Death to high frame rates!Any given viewer's reaction to Avatar 2 will largely depend on their opinion pertaining to the state of filmmaking currently, relating to its trajectory since the release of the previous installment. Those pining for the days of practical effects and tangible sets having nothing to look forward to, but those accustomed to CGI spectacles will be comfortably pleased.Avatar 2's effects are not dated, bland, or indulgent; most of the CGI is beautifully textured and necessary for the film's sweeping camerawork and general scope. The problem is that the underlying failures of computer-generated imagery are stalwart: the characters and objects are weightless, and the physics remain uncanny, even if the aesthetics are often breathtaking.In 2009, the ambition of rendering the majority of a live action film in a computer (one which looked magnitudes more convincing than even the most impressive CGI of the time) was daring enough to justify a tradeoff in verisimilitude. The first film became the highest grossing film of all time (no, not adjusted for inflation) because general audiences had never seen such expansive use of CGI outside of a Star Wars prequel.Now...it's all they know. Viewers will see CGI landscapes and effects in at least two trailers immediately preceding the film (Quantumania and Guardians of the Galaxy 3) which are just as colorful, creative, expansive, and busy. They might be cheaper, not as luxuriously rendered or detailed, but the novelty is long dead.Pre-armed with knowledge of the industry over a decade, and the alarming gap between the two films, it's reasonable to assume Cameron would ration considerable time, energy, and attention to his script - he has not. Motivations, character development, and structure are still laughably childish and thin; despite the 195-minute runtime, the film is largely uneventful. Obviously, Cameron's M. O. this time around is showing off the technological progress and giving audiences a 2001-esque peak into his imagined world, but it's not creative or unique enough to warrant the length or simplicity.Filling the void when spectacle fizzles is grating ""character work"" mostly centering around the offspring of our previous protagonists, Jake and Neytiri. The children are seen as outsiders to the new tribe and are challenged to fit in for the sake of peace and harmony, a plotline which derivatively borrows from the first film, itself an already-tired Dances with Wolves retread.This desolate, barren story soil could be given fresh nutrients with intriguing characters or complex dynamics; instead, Cameron bashes his audiences over the head with one of the most well-trodden and insipid themes of the modern age. It's amusing: a character from a preceding Shazam trailer mockingly references the Fast and Furious films and their shallow fixation on ""family,"" which is followed by Avatar 2's three-hour opus to the word. There's probably some dystopian subtext to the recent fetishization of familial love, but the surface-level triteness alone signals a need for a new dead horse to brutalize.Additionally, the dialogue is laughably blunt, a painful mix of direct verbalizations of feelings and irrelevant, throwaway banter, all articulated by way of grade-school-curriculum diction. The first fifteen minutes are also dedicated to narrated exposition, so rushed and pandering that Rise of Skywalker is blushing in the corner. If, as some have said, the first Avatar gained no cultural traction because it simply lacked a story and characters worth remembering, Avatar 2 will suffer the same relative obscurity. I hope the international grosses are worth all the monosyllables.The performances are dutiful but unremarkable. Unlike the original, there's seldom a scene with real humans in the film, so the motion capture is forced to do the heavy lifting. Actors become voice actors, and only Zoe Saldana musters genuine feeling without being seen.To be fair to Sam Worthington, Stephen Lang, Kate Winslet, and Cliff Curtis, the characterizations are too stiff and flat for any detailed emotion. Similarly, Jamie Flatters, Britain Dalton, Trinity Jo-Li Bliss, Jack Champion, Bailey Bass, Filip Geljo, and Duane Evans Jr. Work admirably as the scuffling youngsters.Avatar 2 is exactly what audiences hope it won't be: a retelling of the original film in a different location, excruciatingly predictable and free of any character, thematic, or intellectual intrigue. Every story element and conservational ideal has been done before, and better.However, this was also true of the original; it will be interesting to see if the technological promise and spectacle of the sequel are enough to lure audiences into theaters like they were a decade and change ago. Personally, the film evoked no particular emotion, but it did put me in the mood for Planet Earth. At least David Attenborough provides narration for subjects who can't already talk."
"In short: this was a waste of time movie, confusing plot, generic acting, all computerized, 300 million dollars of special effects . . . For what?When you left the movie theatre you realize that you learned nothing, were not even entertained. You just spend three hours trying to understand what the hell is going on.Just a money grab courtesy of a Canadian. I will not be watching anymore Avatar movies. Two is enough.I post a lot of reviews here, but IMDB does not publish them, so I am not sure why I even bother. I guess political correctness is the standard and my analysis is too honest for amazon."
"I don't know about oooh such great CGI visuals... it felt a little better but definitely not 13 years later better than the first because I could tell in every scene where the kid Spider was digital and where not. The body animation up close was fine but in perspective it really felt bad gaming render. All emotion and logic of the first one out on the window. I saw the first a million times in 3D at home obviously my favourite 3D movie of all time. This one surely is not. So they make kids they have a family, there is weirdness in the family which is wonderful and it doesn't have to be really explained because honeys as much as you would like this was never a hardcore science fiction movie just light fantasy with elements of tech blah blah. But they wasted 13 years on their beautiful planet and prepared nothing for defense? That's an offence! They didn't talk to Eywa for a solution? Oh wait young Sigourney, Kiri is the new Messiah that will be revealed in episode 5. Introduce vomit emoji here. The story is exactly the same EXACTLY!!!! With more clichés from the first. I knew exactly what will happen and when. Generic to the core. No soul no depth, the reference to blue whale sign talk was super cringe. AND there was a Titanic moment in there, arrgghhh. Mr J Cameron you are hereby dethroned as the king of sequels. Shame on you."
"Opulent, technically brilliant, even perfect form has completely overpowered the essential, and that is the film. It's like staring at a perfect video game played by someone else. At first you are amazed by the perfect graphics, you want to play too, but you can't and then you just stare blankly. The action scenes are absolutely horrible. God, Water World with Kevin Costner was incomparably better than this. I expected it to be nothing much, but I never thought it would be so shocking. What on earth were they doing for 13 years? Disastrous music, terrible finale, non-existent script, extremely unlikeable characters, endless length. Boring, boring, boring and just boring."
"The first half of this review is spoiler free. The second half contains more detailed criticism of the film dealing with plot spoilers and the problems they create with the film. First off, the movie was absolutely visually stunning and worth the theater experience. Every frame could be a perfectly photorealistic image of the fantastical world of Pandora. The underwater scenes were positively spellbinding, and the new creatures and environments were captivating.That being said, the writing was it's downfall. To be fair, I was never bored per se because the visuals were so spectacular, but the movie had 3 hours of beautiful imagery and about 1.5 hours of actual story. It's basically a re-hash of the first movie, and promises another re-hash of the first movie in the third installment that has yet to come out. It resurrects the same villain from the first movie, with the same motivation, in the same setting, under near identical circumstances, and the same stakes.The worst part is that it could have been so much better. With such a high budget and such a long runtime you would think they could spend a few minutes showing/explaining why humans came back to Pandora. Cameron could have shown a few minutes of the current state of planet Earth and the people living there, as well as the people behind the exploration of Pandora. Instead we just get a few nebulous lines of throwaway dialogue. There are so many unexplored ideas in a world where the storytelling possibilities are endless. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't particularly good either. The incredible visuals didn't make up for the bad story, they only distracted from it.(SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!)One thing that Cameron has never explained is why the military is even involved in the first place. The mining and exploration of the planet is purely corporate in nature, so why is a national defense force involved instead of mercenaries and private security? In the film, it is explained that the operations conducted there are no longer paid for by mining for the previous film's McGuffin ""Unobtainium"", but is now funded by the collection of Pandoran whale oil that stops the human aging process. No explanation, no visual backstory, just one line of dialogue from a tertiary character about 2/3 of the way through the movie.Another thing that is glossed over is the fact that apparently the Na'vi can breath oxygen for hours without any negative results, despite the fact that Pandoran air is toxic to humans. Why this is the case is never explored or explained either. Something else that is never explored or explained is the ""immaculate conception"" of Dr Grace Augustine's daughter, Kiri, or her ability to control the wildlife around her like she was (no pun intended) an avatar of Eywa. Yet another thing that is revealed and then left to the imagination is the fact that now the Na'vi can straight up talk to some animals, whereas the previous movie portrayed it (I think) in a much more beautiful and subtle emotional connection. Speech just feels muddy and out of place.Another missed opportunity is the fact that Spider/Miles is Quaritch's son. They share a few minutes of screentime with one another, and Quaritch even protects Spider on multiple occasions, including saving his life (a favor Spider returns toward the end of the movie). However, it's never explained why this Quaritch even cares about Spider, considering he never knew him or raised him. It would've behooved the story to show Quaritch in a flashback with Spider's mother or with Spider as a baby. It would've humanized and built on Quaritch's character beyond big bad military man.Finally, the movie puts forth the idea that apparently humans now no longer just want to strip Pandora for it's natural resources, but want to colonize Pandora because Earth is so badly damaged. Yup. That's right. Apparently, in a reality where humans can traverse the cosmos freely, the ONLY place in the known universe that humans can colonize is the one with with an atmosphere that kills humans in seconds and does not support any Earth life at all. Why? Don't know. I'm sure we'll find out in Avatars 5-8 twenty years from now."
"Avatar: The Way of Water (2022) is a movie that we saw as a family last night in the theatre. The storyline picks up after the previous film with Jake an Avatar, happily married and with a family of his own. When the military returns and it is overheard their mission is to kill Jake and his family, they move from the woods and go into hiding with the people of the water. How long can they hide before the humans find them...and finding Jake may not be their only motive...This movie is directed by James Cameron (Terminator 2) and stars Sam Worthington (Clash of the Titans), Sigourney Weaver (Alien), Stephen Lang (Don't Breathe), Zoe Saldana (Guardians of the Galaxy), Kate Winslet (Titanic), Joel David Moore (Dodgeball), CCH Pounder (Robocop 3) and Cliff Curtis (Sunshine).The special effects in this movie are absolutely stunning and the underwater elements are beautiful and very well done. The characters, both known and new, are fascinating and very entertaining. From a storyline standpoint, this might not be as good as the first film, and there's an overuse of the children for cause-and-effect moments, but it is still science fiction gold and worthwhile. I always adore how these movies highlight the impact of colonialism on culture, nature and the indigenous people. The action scenes are out of this world, whether it is action in nature or the more traditional shootouts, explosion and hand to hand combat. Everything about this picture is fun.Overall, this was worth the wait, a science fiction masterpiece that's an absolute must see. I would score this a 9/10 and strongly recommend."
"SPOILER - Jake and Neytiri fight off a huge corporation looking to destroy the nature on the planet of Pandora so the corporation can harvest a material growing there for profit. The corporation face against the tribe(s) of Pandora is named Quaritch. The film has a message of protecting the planet, but also is a huge war spectacle with gigantic explosions..sound familiar? No, this isn't the plot for ""Avatar"" that came out in 2009, this is the plot for the new 2022 sequel, ""Avatar: The Way of Water"". Just like 2015's ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is a repackage of the 1977 classic ""Star Wars: A New Hope"", this film does the same. Add the ocean instead of the rainforest, add whale-like creations instead of flying dragon-like creations, and sprinkle in some children. It is the same film, complete with some scenes that are so similar the view may think he/she/they are watching the 2009 film. I hope the 3rd film and so on will introduce some new ideas."
"After waiting 13 years, James (Titanic) Cameron takes you back to Pandora in the ineviatable sequel, I'll cut to he chase. Sully has married a Na'vi and fathered a family. When their forest world is threatened, they must move to the ocean world and try to survive, but...... There is not one fresh idea in this purple,yellow, green and blue flourescent world. The story element is derived from films like 'Last of the Mohegans', 'Waterworld','Dances with Wolves', Finding Nemo', 'Moana' ' How to Train Your Dragon' ""Fern Gully' and 'Fee Willy'. The CGI and 'motion capture' FX are state of the art even if the lurid colors look like a child's first grade Dayglow painting. There are also some 'new age' platitudes and plenty of environmental babble to placate the leftist global warning cultists. The character development is, well 'surely you cant be serious' the action moves like a snail stuck on a wad of chewing gum, and the violence is, well violent. The underwater sequences obviously cost a fortune to film but even they look flat and listless. There is no sense of humor , not even any good one liners. The only scenes that have some merit are the waterborne military vehicles pictured in an ominous gray. In essence ,its a standard 90 minute action film without much action stretched into a 3 hour plus ass and bladder buster .Its like being on the Disney 'Na'Vi River Adventure ride for an eternity. You'll be satisfied in half an hour if you can contend with the excess. A truly mediocre movie designed for non discriminating multiplex morons and franchise film freaks. Another P. U .movie review from Lou. Happy Holidays and wishing you BETTER film going in 2023."
"Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?"
"Before we begin, the review, just know that I watched this in 3-D. My score could've been lower if I didn't watch it in 3-D.This movie does a lot of things right. One thing they do right is the VFX. Everything looks amazing and well done. The editing and music is spot on. The direction of the film is good. The actors are very decent. A lot of people return in more ways than one. The chemistry between the actors seems good. Nothing for us. The dialogue is pretty much good throughout the film.Although it is beautiful and well done in certain aspects, there are some things that are wrong with it. The beginning is interesting and good while The middle can drag a bit and the end is very good.The story itself is okay at best. They don't reinvent the wheel or nothing like that. In general, this film is very watchable, but I would suggest 3-D to make it worth your time."
"First of all never doubt James Cameron.Avatar: The Way of Water is beautifully stunning, bigger, better & more emotional than the first one.On a visual and technical level this film is superb eyegasm, make sure you guys watch it on 3D for the most sensation viewing experience of your life.Hopefully the Avatar 2 does really well like Avatar 1 than we will get Avatar 3 and 4 and once Avatar 5 comes very interesting that the Navi be going to earth. As James Cameron tells us that Avatar 5 will see 'action on Earth' - An Earth 200 years from now. Well gonna go see it again next weekend for sure."
"It's nice to see that 25 years after Titanic, there is still no director more capable of capturing and framing the sheer scale and weight of a colossal structure sinking into water in heart pumping, exhilarating mini-sequences than James Cameron, as this film recreates that final 40 minutes of Titanic once again on a much grander scale, except the the added bonus of being set on an alien planet in an ocean filled with sea-monsters.Now, with this long anticipated sequel finally here, I'm once again seeing the same exact criticisms of the first film resurfacing to describe this film, chiefly, ""nice visuals bad story,"" and I've already addressed that tired criticism in my recent revisiting and reappraisal of the first Avatar movie. It's become very popular to criticize the first film for neglecting the fundamentals of character and story structure in service of its aesthetic, a criticism I've come to find unfounded 13 years later, mostly because it seems that people have been conflating ""simple"" and ""bad."" Avatar's characterization is intentionally simple, it is not bad. Obviously Cameron is relying on extremely broad, instantly recognizable archetypes so that its audience can immediately understand the gist of who's who within minutes of screen-time, because Cameron's primary goal is to jump straight into discovery and world building, the very thing that made the first film such a magical and unique experience, which is why he got away with a 20 minute first act and a 100 minute long second act. And people were so quick to jump to the conclusion that the simplicity of the characterization in the first film was a product of ineptitude or neglect, rather than the entire intention, that they missed out on the frequently genuinely funny character interplay and the lovely bits of characters' personalities spritz throughout (seriously did nobody pay any attention at all to the jubilation in Jake's face after getting to walk for the first time in years?) This all goes without even mentioning how solid the original screenplay was, with loads of setup and payoff, as people also like to criticize the first film for its ""weak writing,"" as they are mistaking weak writing for cheesy dialogue, two distinct things that are not synonymous with one another.With all of that out of the way, how does this film measure up to its predecessor? That's a stupid rhetorical question, as you can see from my rating, they're almost on equal footing. I adored every minute of my re-entry into this world. I'm overjoyed I've gotten to re-experience it once again anew at an age where I can finally fully appreciate it. I'm grateful Cameron has managed to (mostly) successfully recreate that same joy in discovery, and that his primary focus of efficiently expediting characterization and setup in favor of jumping straight into exploration and world building has remained (mostly) unchanged after 13 years.Before seeing this movie, I saw an unverified rumor being circulated that James Cameron originally handed in a 9 hour cut of the film to the studios and wanted the VFX team to visualize all of it before he was willing to begin cutting it down. At first glance I immediately brushed this unverified rumor off as a joke (though secretly hoping it to be true, if only for the memes), but at this point, I 100% believe that rumor as the gospel truth and nobody can convince me otherwise. Just so you can understand what I mean, in the first act of this film (which is about 50 minutes now, instead of the condensed 20 minutes of its predecessor), we get three separate retconned storylines added in as events that happened concurrently with the first movie in order to acclimate us to returning characters and explain the existence of two new characters, and a total of eight new main characters are added to the cast, introduced, given screen time and introductions and setup with their own distinct personalities to setup what functional roles they're going to be given throughout the rest of the story, all of whom are going to be tracked as they (along with the returning characters) begin splintering off into sub-groups during the conflicts that arise in the second and third acts. So the fact that all of this plot and all of this characterization is crammed in, as well as an almost comprable amount of world building with even more action beats than the first movie, all manages to fit inside only a three hour runtime is an astonishing feat, and I eagerly await that 9 hour cut (or whatever extended version we eventually get out of this film in the future, as that extra 20 minutes of content in the first's extended edition proved to be extremely valuable) to further flesh out these characters and this world.That being said, as much as people love to criticize the first movie for being light on plot, I hope those people come to realize that they should be careful what they wish for, because this movie absolutely does provide more plot (waaaaaaay more plot). Now I'm going to do some spoilers so if you don't want to know anything about this film before going in (why are you even reading reviews this far in?), then stop reading now because I feel the need to add just how much they manage to fit into this movie:Grace's avatar body was apparently impregnated before her death and her daughter has a mystical connection to plants with many questions remaining to answer.-The villain from the first film returns to life in an Avatar body and is seeking revenge. Oh and also he had a son who was left behind in Pandora who's basically been raised by some scientists and by Jake's Na'vi family and the two of them are given an entire contentious dynamic between familial bonds, mutual resentment for being on opposite sides of the conflict, as well as a mutual desire to connect with one another in spite of their opposition. Oh and also again, this kid has an unspoken interspecial romance with one of Jake's kids and Neytiri also habors some resentments against him which fester in a viscious third act turn. (yeah, all of the plot surrounding this one kid alone is downright LOADED)
-Jake and Neytiri had four kids since we last saw them, and yes, every single one of them are named, given personalities, plot functions, and are individually tracked throughout the action heavy third act -The entire family is uprooted and sent to live with island tribes, and yes, multiple members of the island tribes are given names, personalities, functions in the plot, and are tracked throughout the action heavy third acts.-there's an entire new plot thread introduced regarding plans to colonize Pandora to be suitable for human civilization
-an entirely new resource is discovered on Pandora in order to bring venture capitalism into the oceans with a sub-plot focused around whaling (which adds themes of animal cruelty to the pre-existing anti-colonial, anti-capitalist themes holding over from the first film).And this is all just what I can immediately recall from a single viewing, which I hope has done something to impress upon you exactly how much is going on in this movie in between the real reasons we are all here, for discovery and action, which it pulls off astonishingly well, and if I have even just one complaint this time around, it's that I wish it had gone just as light on plot this time as the first time around, because the segments of this film dedicated to discovery and exploration (which 100 minutes of the first film are dedicated toward) are nothing short of breathtaking. This underwater motion capture tech is on full display in all of its glory and every single underwater scene is bloody magical. I visibly smiled and audibly gasped multiple times, so much so that I wish that they had tacked at least another 30 minutes of non-plot non-action related runtime just to soak (pun intended) this new piece of the world in. As much time as we're given to swim with the creatures in this vast, vibrant ocean, I just desperately wanted more of it before we got into the action heavy final act, which of course, is an absolutely spectacular sequence in which James Cameron flexes for us, for the third time in a row, that not a single working director possesses his ability to setup the kind of heavy, weighted, mind boggling scale that he's done twice now since Titanic.I don't know what the reception of this movie is going to look like several years down the road, whether it will become subject to the same backlash in spite of its achievements, whether it will be doomed to suffer the same cliched, overly tired criticisms that it neglects proper storytelling and characterization, just as the first, but I really hope it's able to rise above that general perception. Either way, I've adored my return trip to Pandora, and I really hope to not wait another 13 years before before I get to go back again."
"Finally, after 13 years of waiting...I'm trying to avoid talking nonsense, but I've never seen anything like this from a technical and visual point of view. It's riveting, maybe too riveting, so that sometimes I missed the main points of the story because I was staring at Pandora's fish. I re-watched the first Avatar last month and was basically ""it was pretty good"". {But} the sequel has much better and deeper characterizationIn this new three-hour movie, James Cameron can turn any viewer into a big fan of his own franchise, who are eagerly waiting for the next movies. The movie ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is considered as a new beginning for this franchise and Cameron was able to further develop the script and characters and remove the weakness of the first movie. He has also created one of the most extraordinary cinematic experiences.Unsurprisingly, the film is a visual masterpiece with rich use of stunning 3D scenery so I definitely suggest you all to see this movie in IMAX 3D. Because without this, you cannot enjoy the movie enoughI was hoping James Cameron would make a slight improvement in the visuals, but these visuals are amazing. Stunning frames one after another. But what I've noticed most is how technical feats are always used in the service of character and world-building.You will find out by watching this movie, James Cameron is a master of technology... and his direction in this film is the most accurate of its kind. Overall, the film is a technological marvel with a breathtaking worldContrary to some critics, I must say that this film is at its best in terms of story, spectacle, spirituality and beauty of this filmmaking and storytelling.As I was already sure, this movie will easily receive several Oscars, including the best special effects and direction, and that it will undoubtedly break records at the box office (2 billion), probably!In the end, I have to say that James Cameron has managed to create a sea and galaxy epic that only he can handle. The movie ""Avatar 2"" is a strange, delightful, dark and very blue work. James Cameron is still miles ahead of the rest."
"Visuals are again 10/10 but unfortunately that is where it ends.Sequal has none, and I mean none of the majesty and awe of thie first film and has relied on recycled junk.I can't imagine how they ever thought this would work let alone make sequals ready to go before simply testing the waters (pun intend) of part 2.After 13 years this film has made clear that the world has moved on from Avatar and the main character. I mean for the last 13 years Worthington has had bomb after bomb and has all but been forgotten, yet we're expected to be excited about his return? Literally everything that made the first film groundbreaking and breathtaking is absent from this film.Finally, let's not forget that Cameron, so sure of himself didn't think ""it's been a long time, lets just make a sequal and see what happens before making a third"". Instead thought ""I'm awesome, I'm going to make 4 sequels in a row all at once"". 🤣"
"I'm over 50 and have been a cinephile all my life and frankly the general trend in sci Fi since Star Wars has been to go big on effects and less devoted to the story line which all are very similar . Greed , revenge, and a fight sequence at the end that goes on for ever.Avatar 2 is no exception. It looks gorgeous , and one has to admire the technology in rendering such lifelike animation using modern motion capture. This is the part which I don't mind. The story however is more of the same , the film is too self indulgent at times and drags on too long . Just because a sequence looks gorgeous or lots of money has been spent on it, doesn't mean it has to be included.The music is forgettable and there is no signature or motif that one remembers, the ending is underwhelming and unresolved , it implies more of the same in avatar 3, Sam worthington's acting is stilted, the screenplay is not well written or exciting, there are no big surprises or twists and there is no humour or relief . My 12 yr old daughter thought it was forgettable and too long. But, it looks amazing; shame someone can't do something original with this technology."
"First of all, movie is 3 hours long. If you are going to watch it on cinema be ready not to go to the toilet for 3 hours. If you want you can go to the toilet but don't worry you won't skip anything important.The movie looks more like a documentary rather than a movie. I watched it on 3D and sometimes the CGI effects seemed like a cartoon. In the first movie we explored many places and creatures of the pandora world. In this one, not too many. Only big whales, and two species of the water creatures, that's all.The script was a bit cheesy. It mainly focused on family problems rather than the world of pandorra or threat to this world. I did not understand how they reserructed dead people, it was out of logic. When they sent people back to I wonder how much time it took them to travel to the Earth. They came back with much more technology which should have taken some time to manufacture. And then coming back to the pandorra should have taken some time too. In my estimation, it should have taken 30-60 years. In their case, it took about 15 years.Jake leaves M'avi tribe to find another place to hide. We don't know what happens to M'avi tribe in the movie. Probably dead, may be not.Overall, it seemed to me that the movie was made in hurry."
"To be honest, having seen the trailer and read the endless bad reviews from snobbish, pretentious journalists I feared this would be bad.Yet again though, don't trust the critics!I don't normally write reviews especially on these blockbuster type of films but I felt I had to counter all the bad reviews out there which were misleading.You can't ask more from a movie. Action packed 3+ hours with the most amazing visuals you'll ever see and a good story to go with it. I'm not sure what more those people critical of it want?See it on the big screen and in 3D to really appreciate the mind blowing visuals. You will certainly get your money's worth."
"Avatar 2 is an amazing experience in terms of visuals, the motion-capture is astounding, the environments of Pandora are exquisite.Well, except the framerate. Unbelievably enough, the framerate is not constant, going randomly from 24 to 48, and it gave me a headache. And I know exactly why. With something he called ""Truecut motion"", he wanted to avoid some ""soap opera effect"" so he kept the 48fps to action scenes...and that's puke for me. If you do 100% HFR like the Hobbit, you can get used to it. If framerate changes constantly, you just get nausea.Even with good visuals, that's not enough to make a movie.I cannot believe how much violence there is in this movie. On 3 hours long, there may be 1 hour of action, combat, destroying things, the colonel trying to take vengeance.The whole movie is about the colonel trying to take vengeance on Jake Sully because Jake decided on Avatar 1 to protect the planet, against his mission. So we end up with a very cliché story of vengeance with a bad guy that never dies, that we seen a million times already.It is beyond me that James Cameron went from Titanic to such a generic cowardly writing. Where is the debate about ecology ? Did ANYTHING evolved in terms of diplomacy ? I can't see any kind of resolution from Avatar 1 to 2. Nothing happened human-Na'vi wise. They just fight. I guess war is the only answer. Is that the real message you wanted to share, James Cameron ? How can we end up with such basic violence and no negociations ? Did you ever watch Star Trek, Goldorak ?There are some interesting stuff, like the meeting between Na'vi and water Na'vi, but that's it.Now, there are a bunch of things that I didn't understand. If humans can clone a mixed Na'vi-human DNA and put a consciousness in it...there can most certainly clone some whale substance to stop aging to millions of liters, right ?How does the Na'vi communicate with the whale ?Why the girl laughs when she see her brother fight ? Is that so funny ?Why on earth the Na'vi get pregnant because the scientists on earth love each other ?And what about stopping aging ? Is that really useful, in a world where you can just transfer your mind into another body ? Why no character thought about that ?What about Earth ? Did anything happened there ? Are there any medias, any people against the whole process ? Does the scientist have any feelings ? Did anyone evolve on Earth ? We have zero news about it. But we do have hours of hollywoodian fighting."
"The visuals are breathtaking. This is the type of movie that the 4DX experience is made for.I loved getting sprinkled with water when the characters had that on screen and to feel the air brushing through my hair while they were flying... Truly mesmerizing!I read some reviewers saying they were bored when watching the exploratory scenes where you get to see the creatures and the world of Pandora.And I can see how that may be the case for some but I personally didn't feel the time as it passed by. 3 hours felt like a regular hour-and-a-half movie.As for the plot - it was absurd, paper-thin and full of weird plot holes that seemed like a 16 year old intern with no experience in screenwriting has written it.Brining back the original villain from the first movie? OK, not great, not terrible.Having his motives be to simply hunt down and kill Jake Sully? Makes no sense without any background story to it. Who sent him? Why sent him on this specific mission? He finds out that it was Sully's mate who actually killed him but proceeds to want to kill mainly Sully?They were mining some weird mineral that was the most expensive thing on Earth in the last movie but now they don't need that at all? As the general said ""We're not a mining operation"".The bad guy is completely evil - he kills for the sake of showing his strength and burns down entire villages only to find Jake Sully.And then proceeds to capture the main character's children but doesn't kill any of them? He wants to provoke Jake Sully but he keeps them all alive?The humans are terrible, theirs soldiers that are trained and they kill everything in their wake but when the na'vi fight back, the humans are unable to kill a single one of them?Jake Sully strangles the bad guy to death and leaves him for many minutes underwater after that but he is: 1. Alive after that? 2. Immediately conscious as soon as he is above the water? 3. Is able to get on his flying creature and take off right away?Those are just a few of the absurd plot holes that plague this movie.But, dare I say it, even with these absurdities, the movie is still a great watch in a movie theater (especially 4DX).So, if you loved the first visit to Pandora, you're going to like this one. It's a decent movie that gets the visuals perfect and is entertaining throughout, so long as you don't think too much about why things are happening on the screen 🙂Definitely a good movie that is worth your 3 hours!"
"I enjoyed the first Avatar when it came out, so I thought I'd enjoy this one as well. It seems they worked really hard on showing the audience how much they've improved the cgi, but in the process forgot to work on the story.I left the theatre shaking my head knowing that no matter how pedestrian the storyline was, people will be impressed at the graphics and it will sell millions of tickets anyway, leading Cameron to believe he did a stellar job. Then he will unleash the more Avatars on us.The first movie is remembered fondly because none of us had seen anything like it before. Nowadays we aren't as dazzled by cgi because it's everywhere, and a movie needs a good plot as well to stand the test of time. I think this will go down in history as a successful movie, but not one you need to see more than once."
"13 years for the same exact movie is INSANE. Avatar: The Way of Water was supposed to be a highly anticipated sequel but ends up falling short of its expectations. Visually the movie is stunning. Zero Complaints there. The introduction to new characters seemed like it would take the film itself over the top. Boy was I wrong!The movie has very little to do with the ""Way of Water"" as projected in the title. Yes a lot of the movie is spent in the water but there's nothing that ties the water avatars to the plot other than the fact that Jake and his family are seeking refuge. Once that's been established it's literally Avatar 1 all over again. They learn the way of the natives, a major loss occurs and then it's war. A simple plot with a bunch of scenes that don't really add to the quality of the film if you're looking for a great story.Dead characters were brought back as avatars and did not capitalize off of the opportunity. The motive was to infiltrate the community to apprehend Jake & they had the perfect tools to make it a disguise/reveal moment but chose to have the Enemy Avatars act just like their human forms. A complete waste of an antagonist. I was very unimpressed with the direction they choseOverall it's a beautiful movie. The plot is very lazy. Feels very copy and pasted. If you've never seen the first one....you can watch this one and probably think it's the greatest thing ever. For those who have seen the first one...This AINT IT."
"Fathers to sons and sons to fathers... James Cameron has proved that kids can save their fathers and it's all about balance.You need to take care of the creatures arounds you so they will take care of you.I think this movie won't make so much money as the first one but this is not a reason for you not to enjoy this masterpiece and it's visual creation.You need to feel the cinematic universe around you and to enjoy the music, the visuals, the story, the words,etc...
Make yourself home.. feel that you're living with them and I'm sure you will enjoy this movie as much as i did.I hope you will.."
"With over a decade of technology improvement, the movie provides even better visuals, more believable CGI(not that the first one didn't), it also continues the beautiful cinematography.But, the script is far inferior to the last one. The movie tries to focus on ""family"", and with Jake and Neytiri already had a movie, this one focus heavily on the children. But most of the plot lines fall into the trap of being a set-up for sequels. A few plots left unanswer in the end and a few plots begin after the mid point and already wrap after just after being introduced. Some of the charcaters are downgraded into 1 dimensional and some do not learn anything meaningful throughout the story. And the focus of the movie shifts completely once entered the third act which diminishes all the set-up from before.In conclusion, definitely a must watch, better visuals but slightly worst script."
"Spoiler alert.In a movie about all being connected to everything else, why wouldn't you write a script about how the nuclear family is what really matters? How about quotes like 'a father protects his family, that's what makes him who he is'? And of course, it all has to end in hand to hand combat, on a burning ship, that's sinking into the sea. . Some of the most cliched and stupid phrases I've ever heard in a movie,This movie has almost as many cliches as the modern family episode where they went to Australia. The one where they let the work experience person write the whole script. Seriously. How can they go spend so much money making this film, and not pay for a proper script writer?"
"The movie was great IMO. Some lower ratings will be expected since it wasn't as action packed as the first one and the main plot isn't anything mind-blowing. However I think this was an amazing experience. The visuals were truly stunning and mesmerizing. I'd say 99% of the effects in this movie were unbelievably good and where there were some few scenes that could've looked better, those scenes still looked as good (if not even better) than most other block buster movies like the MCU. Story wise I believe it was simple, but definitely not bad. The movie focuses more on developing the characters bond with each other and their own individual progress. The movie wasn't as action packed and grand as the first Avatar, which is to be expected since there's 3 more films to follow now. The 3+ hour run time felt like it flew past and as the movie was concluding I actually wished it was longer just cause how amazingly well done the effects were, especially the underwater scenes.The movie definitely lived up to all of my expectations after the first movie, which basically were: even more incredible visual effects, cool action scenes and a good story."
"I don't get the reviews that say this movie is ""less than""... I LOVED IT. Every minute of it. Cameron took the time to develop relationships - between individuals, between tribes, between life forms. The visuals are stunning. What is the problem with ""light on story"". What part of good versus evil has to be expanded on? It's a basic and often times tragic problem that is explored on several levels. The interaction of people and wildlife was again delicately and beautifully done. I did not feel the length at all and could have sat through more. I had many questions that were left unanswered. So I guess that's maybe what I hope next installment will include."
"So lets be clear: the visuals of the movie are stunning (as expected) and even better with the 3D.its a visual experience really. It was amazing and the water have a nice simulation that make the experience even better. So now i am gonna talk something that i didnt enjoyed in the first movie and the second one: the story. I mean it have interesting points like family, love, war. But dont you think that the story is pretty classic? I mean we have also at the end the death of one son of the Jack family. But i found it pretty superficial and if Avatar 2 need that to make emotions its pretty sad. This is a Blockbuster and nothing is subtle: the fights, the animations, the visuals, the immersions are there but in the story i wanted something more subtle, more things to make us think or reflect some problems in society ( they talked about war so its pretty relevant in my opinion). But im not gonna lie that i was happy to see again the characters of the first movie and see how the vilain and the hero grown as a person. The colonel have no pity against Jake and want to make him pay for what he did in the first movie and thats still going on here. We find a Jake more careful, more human because he becomes a father and will make everything possible to make his family safe. And we will see that in the movie. The Battle against Jake and the colonel at the end was great. Now we will wait for the next movie to see what will happened to the kids of Jake family and the colonel family too. But i was really impressed by the visuals. Please go see the movie in 3D. It really worth to see."
"Like the first Avatar the visuals are out of this world... but visuals doesn't make a good movie. :(
The story is as thin as the air. The first two and a half hours were a waste of time. Last hour or so was a little more intertaining... at a point when the sea-Avatars were winding up for battle, they did the Haka face, I was so close to leaving the theatre. What a cliche. I hope James Cameron will concentrate more on the story in his next movie, than using a lot of money on visual effects. You can't make a good movie without a good story. I left the movie with a feeling of wasting 3 hours and 12 minutes."
"Beyond the bubblegum exterior, a powerful sentiment drives much of AVATAR 2's action. As Papa Smurf (Sam Worthington, who might be phoning it in; you can't tell because: CGI but also: Sam Worthington) muses from the start, Neytir's identity is rooted in how others perceive her, and she's never been given the opportunity to tell us who she is. Thus, Neytiri sets out to make a name for herself amid a sea of patriarchal social mores that dismiss her perspective.Along the way, Neytiri's quest teams her with a band of quirky companions, from Cliff Curtis's burly Tonowari, CCH Pounder's of course wise Mo'at, and Sigourney Weaver's American teen except for size Kiri. Even the vocal talents of Kate Winslet -- who sounds as if she'd rather be filming TITANIC 2 than cashing a check, here -- make an appearance in the role of, I think, Smurf Willow, but nothing can lift a drab sense of defeat bubbling under the gloss of Pandora's neon-plastered paint job.No matter how old-fashioned and doggedly colonial its inclinations are, it's still wrapped in a ridiculous package hand-delivered by cyan humanoids. Absurdity isn't always the mark of simplicity, however. Ambitious films like INSIDE OUT and THE MUPPET MOVIE (Gonzo!) prove sharp wit and blue characters don't have to be mutually exclusive. AVATAR 2 buckles under the pressure of the bar set by far superior titles that have come before it, skimping on narrative nuance in favor of a showy fireworks display that's bound to distract nondiscerning cheese eaters on a lazy Sunday afternoon, but might leave anyone with a brain blue in the face."
"Do not look at the special effects but the message within the movie. Is that what we want our kids to see. Watching this movie is like watching the news Russia invading another country and destroying it all. Oh my, how is that everybody is liking this movie. Me and my family watched in Dolby 3D and it was like watching a big screen Samsung with TrueMotion Plus Smoothing cracked to the max. It was like watching a 3 hrs long game like Resident Evil. JC moves to high frame rate (48 frames per second) to enhance this sequel which progresses from land to sea. People are not looking at the big picture. Ya know the elephant in the room.Second, this looked more like nature documentary about how we killed the Indians and destroyed their civilization. How Russia invaded another country. There is so much death. So many animals getting killed. Keep in mind first movie is supposedly year 2154 and second around year 2164, so apparently we learned nothing. We destroyed planet Earth and now we seek to destroy Pandora which is a moon in the star system. There are animal attacks, war scenes, major explosions, fire destruction, near-deaths, and lots of deaths, Corpses shown both animal and human, sequences of strong violence, and some strong language. What may be most disturbing to young children is the cruelty to animals and kids. Animals are hunted and killed, children are kidnapped, handcuffed, and tortured. I know is fake-whale. But still.. Is that what we want to display to kids?Third, some bad guys from first movie comes back in the sequel. Yeah, no originality. They come back as avatars. Of course they are after Jake Sully.Fourth, all Jake's kids speak English. One would think to teach them the Navi language fluently.Fifth, upon arriving at the sea which is very very far from the forest, everybody speaks English fluently. Not only that but they know slang words. Swear words and profanity are NUMEROUS throughout Avatar 2. Since Dr. Grace Augustine was not at sea teaching them English, then who did..?? How did they learn perfect English?Sixth, this movie is supposedly 10 years after the first one, but apparently Jake did not prepare for the second battle. They came back more powerful than ever, so Jake wife and kids abandoned the forest and go to sea to seek refuge and consequently destroy another tribe.Seventh, people beware, those with photosensitivity and epilepsy, Avatar: The Way of Water is NOT photosensitive friendly and may induce seizures.So that's my two cents. And just like what JC did in Terminator, the villain here will be back in Avatar 3. He never dies. Who knows, maybe he'll be back in Avatar 4 and Avatar 5. Sorry JC, I've been waiting 13 years for the sequel and was disappointed. Jacques-Yves Cousteau Would be disappointed.. talk about war, destruction, Ukraine.. wow..."
"Avatar: The Way of Water is a visually eye-popping film I've seen in a while. It is one of those movies to ACTUALLY experience on the big screen in 3D, like you're in another world. James Cameron has pushed the limits of technology in cinema once again to seek his vision. There is a lot more action in this movie than the previous film, a lot of new characters introduced, and a lot of BLUE in this film. The story is very simple, more cliche- like, which I was a little disappointed by hoping we get something more original. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the movie for what it is. One thing that frustrated me was this human character that can't decide what side he's on and it goes on like for the whole movie. Hopefully Cameron do better with his character in the next film, but other than that, I give this movie a watch if you're into the same stories you heard before looking drop dead gorgeous."
"SCORE: 9.9/10The first Avatar movie that came out in 2009 was extremely successful, mainly due to its brand new concept and ahead of its time visuals. 13 years later, in 2022, James Cameron has done it yet again, but with an even better story. Avatar The Way of Water is a stunning, cinematic masterpiece that takes the world of Pandora built in the previous movie and gives us amazing new things. Amazing new characters, a new biome for the Avatar to explore, and high stakes situations that left me on the edge of my seat.Admittedly, I was a bit skeptical from the trailer and the sneak peak I got when rewatching the first one in theaters again. However, this film exceeded all my expectations. It was broken into 3, well written stories that blended together so well. We get to see life after the first movie, and where Jake Sully and Neytiri were at all those years later. There is a beautiful sequence of scenes where we see their family grow, while this movie gets to show off its amazing advancements in visuals. In nerdy gamer terms, it's almost like going from playing a game in 60 fps to 240 fps. It is even more amazing when you consider and know how they filmed this movie. Without spending too much time on the beginning, we are taken to an entirely new section of Pandora, where a majority of the film takes place. We are introduced to the water Avatar, who welcome Jake and his family into their protection.I thoroughly enjoyed the interactions between the 2 types of Avatar. Although the younger brother getting in trouble storyline got a little bit old, watching all of them learn the Way of Water and the creatures that inhabited it was awesome. Now for the end. The action scenes throughout the movie were very good, but the end took it to a whole new level. The decision to kill of the oldest son of Jake and Neytiri was extremely bold and something I was not expecting. In a lot of movies, characters get wounded and then nursed back to health when the dust settles. His death added an additional emotional level to this movie that the previous one did not have and solidified how high the stakes of this movie were. ""A son for a son"". Jake and Neytiri, but Neytiri specifically, went full beast mode on the Sky People and I was here for it. The movie ends with a beautiful scene of the oldest son passing on, and Jake and Neytiri connecting to The Tree of Souls. This movie was amazing."
"*Avatar: The way of water*Runtime: 3 hours 12 minsI have seen so many movies and no one is perfect but I can say this movie is one of the best productions I have seen in years.3D experience is visually stunning and super. CGI animation is seamlessly integrated into breathtaking scale and precisely.The first 2 hours are full of character development. Almost every age of characters were developed. But the Giant whale named Payakan is the most super character in chapter 2.Storytelling is long so you may feel impatient and boring but James cameron keeps distracting you with beautiful scenes. Whether its a pandora, or rain scene or underwater(Which looks like another new world) were mesmerizing.Visual effects are unreal. You can see every detail in depth even action scenes too. Super flow without any blur scenes.Acting is topnotch and they have super chemistry. Score and sound design quality is of cameron's quality.They have seen a different communities which exists in their world with different style of living.This is a stunning masterpiece which one has to watch in IMAX or 3D and that too for 3 hrs+.Filmmaking and Storytelling at its best.Magnificent. One extra heart for the production efforts."
"I have been waiting for this sequel from ten years. After 13 years, this movie is on the run right now. Yes! Only James Cameron can do this visual stunning Movie. This high frame rate movie bring is a new Sea civilization which we can't imagine.Visual, cinematography, music, and direction are best.But a little bit of complain from viewers that longtime run and story is weak. Director should've give attention on story. There is no any new narratives in story telling.Most of interesting part of this movie is second half and the visual of under the sea. Afterall other action part is bit of boring. But yeah ! James Cameron did his best."
"Pandora is created for the first time in this movie. While before this, it was just a beautiful visual idea. Pandora is created for the first time in this film, not because of Cameron's tough filmmaking style. Rather, it is the emotion that create it. Yes, it is the emotion that make Pandora. After Aliens 1986 and Terminator 1984, this movie is Cameron's hardest and toughest movie. This movie is a great work that a tough filmmaker makes up with emotions. The world of Avatar is readable, not too complicated. But it takes form. Avata 2 ' s special effects are not just an invention. Rather, it serves the story.. it serves the characters.. it serves the mise en scene. .... Jake sully and his wife are paid again and are not just big stars of a simple romantic standard level of payment.It seems that here the filmmaker should not refer his story to a film of the first part, but James Cameron explains everything with the focus he has in filmmaking during short impressions.This movie is much better than the first part because here we are not going to go through a very long and boring introduction about a multi-line story. This movie starts from the first moments.The dialogues are not on air. In this film, the director has become an expert in the world of his film and remarkably innovatively creates a very good interaction between action and adventure. It can be very difficult to formalize the plot of a traditional story better than this.I have a nostalgia with the special effects of the first part of this movie (only with its special effects), but that does not make me want to prefer the first part. The difficulty of this movie is like aliens. And I have never seen its softness in Cameron's films."
"First off, shoutout to the whale subtitle.Second, the story and dialogue was so-so but the visuals and world building was amazing. I get that the children are part human but did they really have to say ""bro"" every other sentence? I personally didn't really care for Jake Sully's kids. Besides the subpar dialogue, what kept me in my seat was how photorealistic the VFX were. Every time I thought I saw a beautiful shot, the next one would blow that out of the water (pun intended).Two things James Cameron knows how to do right is pacing an action scene, like the final battle, and directing a sinking ship. I'm intrigued with the direction Cameron is going to go with the rest of the series. What's next, Avatar 3: The Drift of the Sand?!I'm excited to see the rest of the other species and races Pandora has. To offer but could we possibly keep it a bit shorter? My eyes, back, and bladder really felt the full 3 hours towards the end there and that was pushing the limit for a runtime that most people can handle without a captivating story to keep us in our seats."
"Alfred Hitchcock famously said ""To make a great film you need three things: the script, the script and the script.""
I am convinced that James didn't have a Shooting script. He just turned on the camera, filmed a few motion captures, then put in an insane amount of CGI.The characters are devoid of emotion, motive, and charisma, giving them all the same personality as a plank of wood. They are empty vessels for James to use as a megaphone to spread his environmental concerns. Honestly, why not just make a documentary like blue planet and call it a day, or a dozen years in his case. Why waste so much of his and the audience's time and money to say the same thing that's been said multiple times in a much better way, looking at you Wall-E.The story is simple and predictable yet still could've worked had the runtime bee shorter, like a lot shorter - you could cut an hour and a half of this and it wouldn't make the slightest difference in terms of continuity. Scenes that should have ended kept going on for minutes. And some of the sub plots are of the same quality as a soap opera.And at last, The Dialogue. Movies these days don't seem to care about good dialogue, and sadly the audience don't seem to care about it either. A dialogue should firstly and most importantly be interesting. Exposition and escalation (driving the plot forward) are useless instruments if the audience isn't invested in what the characters are saying. The whole movie feels like it was written by a pretentious art student who has no knowledge of how interactive speaking works. It also doesn't help that the actors are terrible, delivering each line without emotion or charisma. They all sound like characters from a very bad video game."
"I watched this movie in IMAX 3D and it was... One of the best cinematic experiences i have had in a long time! The movie looks absolutely stunning!! Most of the time i couldn't tell what was CGI and what wasn't! Thats how real it looks! Every piece of scenery is something to admire! The visuals might not be as groundbreaking as they were back in 2009, but they are still some of the best i have seen in a movie! Cameron expertly crafted this world that you just immerse yourself in!I Also enjoyed the story as it was not following a formular we have seen before, as the first one did where er could recognize the story from other pieces of media! The new characters were great as well and i just really enjoyed exploring this world with them! At the end of the movie it also became obvious that there are still 3 more movies to go as it doesnt quite feel like a conclusion or solution to what was set up!I dont Know if it is better than the first movie as i see this more as a cinematic event! If you want to watch this movie, watch it in theaters! Watching it at home will not give you the full experience.. trust me!"
"This movie is defintely worth a watch. The visuals in this movie are absolutely stunning - so much so that you actually tend to forget how incredible it is while watching it since it is so masterfully done throughout.I rewatched the first Avatar the same day as I went to see this one, and even though there are some obvious changes made to the story and the universe itself, it isnt done with too much consequense to the overall experience so all good there.The only real criticism I have to give is regarding the story/plot - or the lack thereof. While the first movie had an extremely simple and unoriginal story at least there was one. Avatar: The Way of Water seamingly has no plot or considerable storyline at all and sets out mainly to show off its visual superiority which makes it seem a bit hollow. Naturally this is a shame but I will still recommend this movie for the visuals and the delightful reunion with the universe of Pandora."
"I have to say that is was worth seeing this movie on the big screen as visually, it was magnificent and I couldn't take my eyes off watching it. Possibly the best movie I have ever seen visually. Here comes the but...But, where this movie excels visually, it has come up short in the story/plot. It just felt a bit repetitive and was too similar in a way to the first Avatar movie.It felt that James Cameron's main focus was on making a near perfect movie visually but has unfortunately had a negative impact on the plot. Overall, it gave the movie a real unbalanced feel to it so I hope for Avatar 3 he can bring a stronger story/plot which will make it more unpredictable and enjoyable.One final point I have to make. Why did they feel the need to have Sigourney Weaver play the voice of her daughter that is still a child? Everytime she spoke, it just didn't come across right at all. Why is a child talking like a 70 year old woman?! What benefit did they get from this seriously? What a strange decision. If you have a female child character then cast a child actress. Simple as that!"
"The biggest thing for me when it came to this movie was the story for it. I was worried about how exactly they would continue this story naturally and keep the audience interested as well. While I do think the story was able to do all of that I also still think it might've needed a few more edits to make it a bit better. What I enjoyed the most was the family element in this movie. Obviously, between the first movie and this one, it was inevitable that Jake and Neytiri would have a family of their own. So I really enjoyed getting to see how connected this family is and showing the different dynamics in it as well. They felt like a real family with how the siblings would stand up for each other one second and the next just make fun of them. But due to how many new characters there are in this movie an important thing to have is balance. When a movie has new characters to introduce and have the audience build connections with them it's important to give them all enough time to develop and show their dynamics with other characters. Although I would love to say this movie does a good job balancing all of the characters in it, I can't say that fully. When it comes to the kid characters in particular the story does a good job of spending time on them depending on how important they are. But when it comes to the other characters in this movie at times I forgot they even existed due to how little screen time they get. I can see why in this movie Jake and Neytiri weren't shown as much but there was one character, in particular, I was surprised didn't get that much screen time.Spider, played by Jack Champion, despite being an interesting character didn't get that much screen time which was disappointing. He had so much potential to be this really interesting character to study but just ends up being forgotten along the way. But he wasn't the only new character who was just tossed to the side but also a lot of the Metkayina's were also just pushed to the side. I feel like when it came to pushing characters to the side it primarily affected the water tribe and none of the characters there were fully fleshed out. So many of them just ended up being flat characters and I really hope in future movies they get more screen time so they can be proper static characters. I think the biggest reason why some of the other characters who aren't a part of the Sully family get pushed to the side is due to the part of this story I didn't really enjoy which is the sky people returning. I'm not against them returning and kind of figured they were going to return it's just how they choose to have them return. In particular, how they decided to have Quaritch, played by Stephen Lang, return to be the big bad in this movie. I will applaud the movie for actually addressing how this is possible, despite it making zero sense, but I wish they created a new bad guy for this movie. But that wasn't my only problem with the sky people's storyline which is that it didn't feel fully thought out. There were two different storylines going on with the sky people with one of them just randomly being forgotten about and the other one literally appearing out of nowhere. I can see what the ideas were for this but I wish they had just adjusted it a bit to make it a bit more interesting. It's also because of this that at times the movie feels like it comes to a screeching halt. Overall, the pacing of this movie was surprisingly well done and I didn't notice how much time had passed. One of my biggest concerns was with the over three-hour-long run time and thinking there were going to be scenes that could've been cut or shortened down and I was partially correct.For the most part, I never felt like the movie was dragging at all and was moving at a decent pace especially in the opening scene when we're being reintroduced to the characters and the Sully family. But I did start to feel the pacing issues once the sky people return and the family go to the Pandora reefs. Once at this point in the movie is when I started to find scenes that could've been cut down or cut out. What I find the funniest thing though about this movie is despite everything flowing well the ending for this movie was so rushed. The ending can be best described as don't blink or you'll miss it due to how fast it goes. But I think the real biggest reason you don't notice how much time has passed is due to the special effects in this movie. Despite how many years have passed since the first Avatar movie came out there's one thing everybody can agree on which is the special effects aged super well. I specifically love how if you compare the motion capture from the first movie to this one you can for sure see a difference in the CGI. From the Na'vi to the creatures of Pandora everything looks so much cleaner and natural. This is especially true when it comes to the look of the creatures of Pandora. By getting to properly explore the reefs of Pandora we get to see all new creatures that mainly inhabit the ocean and once again I'm asking how can I ride them. The Ilu, Skimwing and Tulkun are all well-designed creatures that look incredible. But it's not just the people or creatures that are jaw-dropping but the environment of Pandora as well. We've already seen what the forest of Pandora looks like so it's exciting getting to see this whole other area and how gorgeous it is. Every scene that's underwater is just breathtaking and makes you wish you could go and visit this place. Definitely a huge round of applause for every single special effects crew person for their hard work creating these underwater creatures, the environments and the Na'vi people. But of course, without actors in the Motion capture suits, none of this would work out.I can't say the acting in this movie was the best but what I will say is that all of the kids in this movie really stole the show. For most of the teenage actors in this movie, this was their very first big movie role and it really doesn't show. All of them are able to convey the proper emotion that's needed for the scene and make their character stand out amongst the others. For those who have siblings will be able to most likely relate to one of the Sulley siblings due to how well they demonstrate the different kinds of siblings everybody has or are. A person who was a surprise to me was Trinity Jo-Li Bliss, who plays Tuk, as I expected Tuk to be the cliche annoying little sibling but was actually fun to watch. I will say as the youngest I did relate to her the most but the other person I related to and really enjoyed watching was Lo'ak, portrayed by Britain Dalton. Out of all of the Sully kids, Lo'ak was honestly the most interesting to watch due in part to Britain Dalton's portrayal of this character. He conveyed perfectly this kid who's trying his best to fit in with the others in his family while still being true to himself. He always stands up for what he believes in and despite everything is always there for his siblings to protect them from anything. Despite not having that much screen time another actor who surprised me was Jack Champion. Like I said earlier Spider is such an interesting character study as he's human but raised among the Na'vi. I feel like with more screen time Jack Champion could really bring so much to his character and make him a fan favourite. I remember looking at the cast list and seeing that Sigourney Weaver, who plays Kiri, was coming back for this movie and was curious to see how. Well, Sigourney Weaver did an incredible job playing the teenage daughter of Grace. I know for the most part it was because of the CGI that she looked completely different but I still couldn't tell that it was her playing this character. I thought they brought in a young actress to do all of the motion capture and she just did the voice work but no.Sigourney Weaver actually played Kiri from the physicality to the vocals and you can tell she put in the effort. She comes across as a regular teenage actor from her voice to her body posture and conveys that emotion so well. I will quickly say that despite not having a lot of screen time Zoe Saldana was also pretty good. Every time Zoe Saldana was on screen you saw Neytiri's character growth over the past years and how becoming a mother has changed her. She's super supportive of her family and just wants what's best for them. She also just brings such raw emotion to this character as well that you're just hypnotized by her performance. Everybody else in this movie was also pretty good but due to many of them not getting much screen time they couldn't fully show off their acting ability. The last thing I want to mention is the editing in this movie because it was just weird. For the most part, the editing in this movie was just fine but there were a few occasions where the editing was just weird. There's this one scene where this one thing is happening and then it randomly cuts to something else not related for only a couple of seconds before cutting back to the original thing. It was during these few moments that I was taken out of the movie experience and decently confused. In the end, Avatar: The Way of Water surprised me but also proved me right by still having some issues with the story. But, this movie is definitely worth seeing at least once on whatever specialized screen your local theatre has just for the special effects alone. I'm curious to see what will happen in Avatar 3."
"The cgi and underwater scenes are excellent. This is perfectionism- something only Cameron can do. Finally - 3D movies at cinema makes sense, a completely new experience and a new standard for coming movies in the future. This innovation qualifies to a top rating...However, the story is predictable and quite boring. The film is intended for a broad audience with a banal and simplified message. This is Pocahontas 2.0 for premature adults, and is more of a cartoon than a movie. I had hoped for something more advanced. Saving whales and sustainability in general is a no brainier - and the Alabama man won't change his mind after watching this movie anyways."
"I just now saw this in 3D, and was completely immersed from start to finish. I smiled, laughed, cried, my heart raced, and my jaw was agape many times. It's the best cinematic experience I've had since the first Avatar (13 years ago!), maybe even surpassing it.I'll be seeing it in IMAX in a couple days, and any other screen style I can.Bravo to everyone involved with this masterpiece, it is a whole new step up in cinema, much in the way Lord of the Rings was for its time.Avatar: The Way of Water truly has a beautiful feel to it. The writing and story is superb, the casting and acting is stellar, and the theme of sacredness about nature and the ocean is woven into every frame of the film. The main element that really impressed me was how seamlessly the CGI melded with the real people interacting with Pandora and its inhabitants, making me completely forget that this gorgeous world we dive into isn't footage from Earth, despite me wanting it to be.I loved how the film takes its time with character development and letting the audience breathe in the beautiful world of Pandora, rather than rushing through everything (like how many other blockbusters do), and also not wasting a moment.I am really happy and excited that we're going to be getting at least 3 more Avatar movies after this, at least hopefully! It feels like we're back to an era of movies that I'm excited about again, after about a decade of drought. That being said, the movie's title is very fitting; an oasis in the expansive desert that modern media has long been."
"It's not without its issues but completely spectacular visually, Avatar: The Way Of Water is a fantastic welcome return to form for James Cameron with game-changing special effects and his sixth sense for entertainment that is shining on screen. It's not perfect but people are gonna love it. Fans of 2009's Avatar are going to be under a spell revisiting this world with the 13 years of technological advancement, Cameron was clearly hard at work behind the camera. The theme of the new sequels seems to be clear: it's about family.With the gap since the last movie it was important to recreate the magic of Pandora right from the start and the film does take you right back into it from the first scenes with amazing visuals: the colors are popping, the scenery is magnificent and similar to its predecessor, Way Of Water sets the bar very high for special effects in future blockbusters. You can trust James Cameron with rich world-building but also for directing action that feels realistic and this movie gives you one hell of a ride in terms of spectacle. At times Cameron is paying homage to its own movies and I was totally on board with that. It is an absolute achievement on a technical level without a doubt.I was able to see the film in IMAX 3D (HFR Experience in 48fps) and I'm going to get into a minor nitpick that doesn't affect my overall judgement of the film. I am not a fan of high-frame rate (60fps instead of the usual 24 frame per seconds), and the screening I saw had some shots going back-and-forth between 48fps and 24fps which was distracting for me at first. I doubt this will be an issue for most people, and this might actually not apply to every screenings as it's going to be showing in Regular 3D and 2D everywhere, but this is something that bothered me, I'm not going to lie. It's as if someone was turning the motion smoothing on and off as you're watching a scene. That is the only technical nitpick I would have to add and this is why I want to see it again this weekend to get a better judgement.I don't want to say too much about the story and the characters because Cameron is clearly building something big that everyone needs to experience by themselves on the biggest screen possible. I would also suggest rewatching Avatar before going into this new one. Will it have the same effect that the original Avatar had? I guess we're going to find out in a couple of days, but my guts tell me that the audiences worldwide are going to love this movie and this is only the beginning for this franchise. Sure, a lot of this movie felt like setup for the future, but it's absolutely gorgeous to look at and never boring. Welcome back Mr. Cameron, we missed you!8/10."
You could have but an hour out of this movie and it wouldn't have changed much to the storyline.At one point I forgot I was watching a movie as it seemed more like A David Attenborough Documentary.Yes it's Visually Stunning but after 20 minutes we need More than effects.The story is very weak with lots of holes that they don't even try to explain to the audience .I've no idea how they'll get another 3 movies from this franchise.I won't be going to see anymore unless James Cameron Invents a new way of watching in Cinemas.We get good action at the end but for me this falls flat.They had 12 years to work on a cracking script but gave us this instead.Nah !I loved the first Film as it was new and fresh and unlike anything we'd ever seen before.But now that we've seen that there's seems to be nothing left.
"Cameron has been hugely successful with epic storytelling - that includes spectacular world-building, memorable characters and a captivating adventure that takes you on a ride.While this movie was good, it wasn't in the same league as his previous ones. In fact, it felt more like an episode than an epic.Basically we get a familiar world (albeit a water location), unremarkable characters and a familiar enemy & plot. I didn't feel like I'd want to sit through the same movie again at the theater anytime soon (unlike my reactions to the first ""Avatar"" and Titanic).Even so - the wonderful aquatic visuals for for most of the 3+ hours created an ""experience"" of sorts. It let me let off my feeling that the intro was a bit rushed with the character introductions and explanations (esp. The kids).I hope Cameron is able to recapture his ""epic"" moviemaking style in Avatar 3. He's a great movie-maker and I still plan on getting tickets for the sequels."
"The movie closely resembles the social problems of today's world - immigration and outcast. The protagonist is a father who avoids conflict and then engages in conflict for the same reason - ""A father protects"". The problem with the movie is the lack of emotional connect with the characters.There is a great scene in the movie which should evoke sympathy... but it just falls flat. But, the response was tremendous when a outcast creature saved the day. It could have been problem with 3D movies as you are immersed in the visuals, rather than the characters.Do watch if you want to witness peak of creative minds!!"
"I still have fond memories of the original Avatar. Although the storyline was cliche and the script was amateur at times, the sum of all its parts (mainly the visuals) were able to create a fantastic experience where the viewer walked out happy.This movie tries to replicate the first and fails miserably. The story is almost the same, the acting is worse and the dialogue is embarrassing. There are more plot holes than I can explain, meaning the viewer is being punished for over three hours. And the fact that they pull the original cast back, even though two of them died in the first... come on.If you've watched the first and liked it, don't ruin it by watching this dribble. Cameron is just trying to get the money."
"5 out of 5 stars.Avatar The Way of Water is one spectacle thrill ride that takes you back to Pandora. It is one amazing journey the film takes you. Writer/director James Cameron delivers and surpasses the original. The first movie was incredible. This sequel he tops it and does it better. This film is one amazing ride. The story is great while delivering new characters. New world building. Incredible action sequences. The visual effects are amazing. The film has more action than the first. The film delivers with its story and theme about family.The cast ensemble returns and are great. Plus with some new additions. The story is great about Jake trying to protect his family and there home. While the villain is back without giving away spoilers. It does not disappoint with the returning characters. The music score is great. The second hour spends it with Jake and his family learning from a tribe that lives out on sea. There way of life. There meaning. And it is a beautiful journey. The film can be emotional with where it goes.The action sequences are awesome. With a great epic climatic battle out on sea. The film is 3 hours and 12 mins long. And the movie felt like it went quick and fast. With its amazing world and character building.Overall, Avatar The Way of Water is one spectacular film which improves from the original with every thing. And still gets you excited for more to come. James Cameron delivers with this sequel. I can not wait to see where he goes with the next several sequels."
"I don't often leave reviews, but I had to get my thoughts down after just seeing a showing for this sequel. I'm a huge James Cameron fan. I remember hyping up the first film to practically everyone I met weeks and months before it's release. ""It's James Cameron!"" I would say to them excitedly.And I loved that film and have watched it many times since its release.There are serious problems with this sequel though (and I'm starting to suspect that Disney outright owns professional critics at this point.)The plot is paper thin. The film opens as humans unceremoniously return to Pandora. They just arrive in a fleet of ships, and their plan is no longer to obtain unobtainium - they want to relocate / populate Pandora because Earth is dying. Now, the environmental themes of the first film were well handled; they were subtextual and the plot and characters spoke of them and represented them well. Here, the message is practically shouted straight into the camera. It's very heavy-handed, and it's not good science fiction - it's the same old doomerism that you'll find on any typical angsty subreddit about the future.Colonel Quaritch (the main villain from the first film,) is just dropped into the film via cloning in the space of about five minutes. How did he get his memories back? Oh, they just downloaded a copy from the original Quaritch. No deep science fiction backstory here, just your basic run-of-the-mill copy, and now he wants revenge. A character that was an interesting foe in the first film (if a little bombastic,) here becomes a silly one-dimensional bad guy. And he survives the ending, which he shouldn't have; this villain is not compelling enough to push these characters through more sequels.After the first act, Jake and Neytiri are largely pushed aside as the film focuses on the children. For the most part it's a very family-friendly film, and then towards the end there are sequences and fight scenes that are decidedly not family-friendly. The kids are not interesting in the slightest, except for Kiri. She has a connection with Grace and Eywa that isn't fully explained, and she develops supernatural powers which aren't discussed by any of the other characters. They just sort of happen. I get why they happen; she has a connection with Eywa, but the whole arc is just left hanging by the end, and presumably we have to come back for the sequel to find out what happens with her.The death of one of the siblings felt borderline exploitative. Cameron's insistence (as another reviewer mentioned,) on pushing the nuclear family agenda doesn't really work well in these times. It works for him because he's very wealthy, to be frank, but it doesn't work for a lot of young people these days. I was already wary of that going into the film, and that trepidation was justified. I can't relate to this guy with a gaggle of children, who, frankly, I don't think should be having children at all. I don't see Jake Sully as a father.The new Mcguffin will have you rolling your eyes for certain. Did you think unobtanium was bad? OK, here we go. I've always defended James Cameron's films, and I defended the choice to use the descriptor ""unobtanium"" in the first film. Why? I could find several reasons: none of the main characters really care about it for starters. They have other concerns. Grace love's the N'avi and Pandora, Jake is not a scientist, Selfridge is a corporatist etc. The ones who care about the actual chemical name are back on earth waiting for this valuable superconducting material (and, yes, a room temperature superconductor would be that valuable.) Plus, it is a term that physicists have used in the past to describe incredibly powerful substances that they just don't have.In this film, we're introduced to a substance inside the brains of whales that prolongs human lifespan. Yes, you read that correctly. That's the unobtanium of this film, and it's only mentioned once. But apparently it's worth 80 million $ a bottle. I mean, the year is approximately 2170 at this point. If mankind doesn't have longevity and anti-aging treatments already, and needs to hunt space whales for it... well, I'm sorry but this makes no damn sense.It's BAD SCIENCE FICTION, and It's bad writing.The film will remind you repeatedly that you're watching a sequel to Avatar. From repeating lines verbatim from the first film (this must happen about ten times!) to using identical musical cues for similar scenes.It's basically an hour of great action and two hours of splashing around with whales and various other water animals, while Jake continuously scolds his children for being bold. And James Cameron wants you to know that whales are beautiful animals that are viciously mistreated. Yes, we're aware Mr. Cameron. There's very little the general film-going public can do about it though. I sure wish I had a fridge filled with vegan snacks on the go. If I did, I'd be vegan. But then again, I don't have half a billion dollars in my bank account. Most people barely have time to pay their bills, so your message is largely falling on deaf ears, even though you're shouting now.4 stars for Sigourney Weaver and the VFX (Weta) people. You worked hard and deserve all the accolades you get. Visually, it's a gorgeous film. But I have no idea what Cameron was going for with this shallow, paint by numbers sequel. I'm done with Avatar."
"Just one word ""Overhyped"". It is a very very long movie. It is completely all about colorful 3D scenes. Other than those 3D visuals, and weird looking animated characters, there is literally nothing in this movie. Back in 2009, it was great deal, even with a below average movie. But today with all the marvel and DC, it feels boring and me giving 6 out 10. I am being over generous. It reminds me of a Hindi Saying Which I have mentioned in the title. James Cameron is just exploiting his name or trust that he earned over the years with movies like Terminator, Terminator 2, Titanic, Avatar etc. He is using his name and brand to make us waste our money on the cr***y sequels of his old successful movies. In span of 4 years, he disappointed me twice, once with Terminator: Dark fate and then again today with Avatar: Way of Water. His fan base is now his pension fund. Best of luck to him!!!"
"The long awaited sequel Avatar 2, The Way of the Water is a 3 hour monolith by the director and part time environmentalist James Cameron. With the film costing about the same as a premier league football club, there was some serious pressure on box office returns. However, it did mean that Cameron had all the fancy toys that money could by in order to make it look good. And it did. Unfortunately money can't always buy a good story and this story was average at best, being very similar to the first film. I can aslo safely say that I haven't seen parenting that bad in a film since Kevin McCallister was left behind by his mum and dad in home alone. Furthermore, within the three hours we are treated to a twenty minute fishing sequence, which transported me back to late 2000s British televison programme Robson Green's extreme fishing. A welcome callback for me as it gave me a little break from the boredom that I was suffering. Although the film may recover its hefty budget, it is unlikely to linger long in the memory of world cinema. For me it was mostly just colours and noise washing over like the waves... And that is just the way of the water sometimes. 4/10."
"This new Avatar is a tricky movie to review. The technical compartment is so innovative and amazing that it is impossible to call it in any way a bad film, as it represents the pinnacle of what can be done today in terms of visual accomplishment. It also expresses one of the most beautiful capabilities of cinema, which is to create unimaginable worlds and unfold them before the viewers' eyes. Not for a second the spectator can doubt the reality and beauty of Pandora's world, its vistas and creatures. And it is precisely in the depiction of this world that Avatar holds all its value.On the opposite side of the coin, however, it is difficult to find any real strengths in the story or the characters; in particular, the characterization of the parents is obtuse. The discourse on nature and the synergy we should have with it, albeit not new, is the most interesting topic. The conflict and triggers are not. As for the action, some of it is quite confusing, but it is fun to see what almost seems like an alien retelling of Titanic.In a few words, the beauty we witness seems an end in itself. This new Avatar is a creature such beautiful in appearance but with no other reasons for being. It's not a bad thing anyway, as it kind of trace it back to what is cinema in its earliest scope, that is, to show viewers something that should not be possible to see in reality."
"This is an art. You may not be moved much by the story. But you cant deny the experience.I'd goosebumps 10-15 times atleast just by looking at those mind boggling beautiful frames.Talking about the story, it may appear like lot of build up right from start, the end action sequences almost lasted for an hour and boy, oh boyy those beautifully transitioning frames will ensure your mouth remains open just because of its sheer beauty. At times it looked soo beautiful I almost cried a little.You may feel I'm bit exaggerating, may be I am. But 1 thing I'd bet on is, you can't deny the experience.THE EXPERIENCE is why I'm rating this 10/10."
"James Cameron's long-awaited sequel to 2009 ""Avatar"" arrives in theaters this weekend and it has critics captivated and exasperated. Disney's ""Avatar: The Way of Water,"" which clocks in at over three hours long, is being hailed as a stunning piece of cinema, generating a ""Fresh"" rating on Rotten Tomatoes. ""The Way of Water"" follows Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) who are now the parents of four Na'vi children. The family is driven from their forest home when humans return to re-colonize parts of Pandora. Way back in 2009, ""Avatar"" arrived on screens as a plausible and exciting vision of the movie future. Thirteen years later, ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" - the first of several long-awaited sequels directed by James Cameron - brings with it a ripple of nostalgia. Jake and Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña) are raising a brood of biological and adopted children, whose squabbles and adventures bring a youthful energy to the sometimes heavy, myth-laden narrative. Cameron's embrace of the idealism of adolescence, of the capacity for moral outrage as well as wonder, is the emotional heart of the movie. You feel it in a horrifying scene of tulkun slaughter that aspires to the awful, stirring sublimity of the last chapters of ""Moby-Dick,"" and also in the restlessness of Lo'ak, Spider and Kiri as they try to figure out their roles. Although Cameron's sequel is highly anticipated, it's not necessarily parallel to the rabid Marvel and Star Wars franchise fans who flock to the earliest-possible showings. ""Titanic"" (1997) and ""Avatar"" (2009) both opened on this weekend, in different eras of preview shows. ""Avatar"" grossed the equivalent of $5 million (adjusted) in midnight shows only. Neither film had an opening that conveyed their ultimate success, but this was due in part to the more-limited theater capacities of the period. ""Titanic"" ultimately grossed 22 times its opening weekend; ""Avatar,"" 10 times. That record makes any definitive response to the preview numbers more difficult. Quaritch is joined by some deadly human fighters too, and Avatar: The Way of Water encourages us - successfully - to root against humanity for all the destruction it's unleashed on the world. We've seen that before, including in the first Avatar, but it speaks to Cameron's real achievement, which is to bring us into total identification with these computer-generated Na'vi characters."
The hardwork and dedication of James Cameroon is quite plausible in this part of the series. The visionary director comes up with a marvel and to watch it in imax made it more special. The length of the movie is one problem and another problem is it's first half which was way slow. Visuals were breathtaking. The background score was also good and the one must see the behind the scene clips to better understand what goes behind creating such a epic movie. The script should have been little tighter without getting into unnecessary details. Avatar 2 should be felt and will be remembered for it's breathtaking CGI and graphics.
"Pros:
Pretty, very pretty.Addresses some important issues of diversity.3D was used nicely, although could've been more regular.Cons:
Overly long. I was prepared for the length but found my mind drifting from the beginning and completely zoning out in the last half an hour.Weirdly boring and repetitive despite the stunning visuals and constant action.Despite exploring issues of diversity, women were secondary, supportive characters.Didn't add anything to the first. Just a re-telling of the same conflict.Overall:
A nice experience but could've been meaningful, interesting and enjoyable if it focussed on a proper narrative. There were so many surplus scenes about so many things, I was left numb."
"""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is a visually stunning film that explores themes of family, responsibility, and the fight against evil. The film struggles with some clunky narrative elements and hazy motivations for its villains, but ultimately offers an immersive and engaging experience. The midsection of the film, which focuses on the world of Pandora and its inhabitants, is a standout, showcasing the incredible world-building and imagination of director James Cameron. Overall, ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is a must-see for fans of the franchise and anyone looking for a thrilling and thought-provoking adventure."
"Visually stunning, emotionally strong with great action & music that is what Avatar 2 for me. Finally the year is ending by this amazing film I was excited about.Strong characters, good storyline, epic visuals, amazing music, great message especially about nature, species & family ( & no this film will not give you any lecture on any of it so relax!) all in all a beautiful film directed by the master of cinema James Cameron.Especially the characters are all amazing & different loved all of them, my favourite one become Jake's younger son Lo'ak as I got really connected with him more & as for the antagonist you'll gonna hate him slowly which is a good thing.Recommended to watch it with your whole family for a better experience emotionally & they'll thank you as well as you'll thank them all.Overall a great cinematic experience. Thanks for each & everyone involved in this film."
"The graphics were not much better than the original.The storyline was so mundane and pedestrian I almost fell asleep at one point.There was not a single wow moment here. The 3D was average, the acting was lame, there was no deep moral or other issue here that has not already been explored in countless other low budget movies over the years. I saw the movie with my wife and kids and none of us were impressed. My kids thought it was fun but I saw a teen in another row start playing games on their dimly lit mobile half way through this screen drivel.What an absolutely, mind-bogglingly weak movie this was. Shocking to think this took over a decade to make."
"James Cameron did it again! This is a visual masterpiece that may be even better than the first part. Beyond the breathtaking and landmark visuals and the on-point politics which only become more and more important, especially from the country it is coming from, there is a magic that Cameron creates here that touches your soul.While rewatching the first part from the theatres, I felt that part of it and realized there's so much more to it than what is on the surface. It is even more clear here. I used to think Cameron is wasting years of his life on these projects but I can really see why he dedicates it to these. Way of Water made me feel, how spiritual these films are and how much they would've meant to Cameron. My favourite parts in this film are in the middle when the Sully family finds and connects with the different lifeforms and the life of water. The mystery behind the character of Kiri really added to my understanding of the importance of the spiritual aspect in the film.While looking at these films we can think that if they wanted to show the issues with imperialism and capitalism, and the importance of environmentally sustainable indigenous life, they didn't have to make it happen in an alien environment and this is simply a way to explore the visuals and the commerce with it. But watching this has really changed my opinion on that. I really get why Cameron waited long years before making these films to achieve the complete vision he had. The basic concepts he had to tell have been told in various ways so many times. But they are not magical enough to reach the hearts of the viewers the way something as visually stunning as Avatar does. But beyond just the visualization, there are so many factors hindering that in other iterations of this story. The world is inherently capitalistic and so many of the depictions of the truths would be viewed in a sympathetic light but still considered by most as a necessity or something that cannot be stopped. Spirituality has become a corrupted term that is only used by those who want to extort money and power from people. The corruption in the collective psyche of the world doesn't allow anyone to believe in the triumph of a social uprising by the marginalized anymore. When it is viewed from a distance as an Alien world, where nature itself can communicate with you, provide everything needed and doesn't really have anything to gain from the globalization of the western world it becomes much more plausible to believe in it. It actually showcases a world where natural social evolution would have taken a species without interference from a handful of people who holds power. Even those who firmly believe against such a social evolution would start believing in the way these aliens live. Showing the Na'vi people being truly one with nature and finding the beauty of the world and its meaning with it makes the film the ultimate spiritual exercise by Cameron to tell his philosophy on life. And he doesn't abandon his fun-loving side to do that. He indulges in giving you exhilarating action scenes along with the way of water in this film. The improved 3D technology and the 48 fps make sure it's not a gimmick and instead make you feel you are in there with them experiencing it.This film pays homage to a lot of older films of Cameron and parenthood has been something he liked to dabble with a lot. Here that is the central point of the plot and why most of the events occur in the order they happened. Unlike some other films, when they speak about family here, it resonates and makes the proper impact.For me, Way of Water is even better than the first part. This is one of the best films of the year and I'm eagerly waiting for the sequels because I can really see that this is just the beginning."
"Do you absolutely need to see this movie? No.The 3D, the CGI, the Action are excellent, yes. In the past 13 yeast we had however seen similar. I feel like the reviews claiming that this is an esential blockbuster spectacle are exaggerated. Given the run time of 3+ hours, nice CGI really isn't enough to keep you engaged.The storytelling is problematic. I went into the movie expecting a simple story and there is nothing wrong with that. Top Gun Maveric was simple, but it worked. The story is simple, the characters are interesting, likeable. The problem is with the plot, which suffers from a couple of convenient deus ex machinas that were not set up before hand. On the other hand there are some 'problems' in the climax that could have been solved pretty easily by the new skills the characters had acquired, yet they do not do it because... reasons. The movie then suffers from resolutions that don't really feel earned, but also drama that feels fabricated just for the sake of tension.Though I had a good time, I absolutely do not feel like I need or want to see this movie again in the cinema again, nor do I feel compelled to send there my friends and family. I have seen The Batman, Top Gun Maverick and The Northmen twice in cinema this year. Avatar 2 was good, but didn't really feel essential.Oh, there is no after credit scene, so no need to wait."
"I saw ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" last night. It must be seen in 3D to be truly enjoyed. A good film and I recommend it to fans of the original. However, I am ambivalent on the story line - do all of the humans (other than Jake and a few other characters) have to be complete a-holes? And I am a bit tired of being hit on the head by the anti-colonial message from James Cameron. The parallels to the European conquest of North America and genocide of native Americans are obvious. OK, we get it! Move on. Again, I still recommend the film for the visuals and action, but the storyline has become tiresome."
"For years I've been thinking nothing could surprise me of entertainment, movies or tvs shows, until I watched avatar 2. I thought the first avatar was average so I wasn't expecting much from this. But this movie completely blew my mind away. This is a perfect movie for a cinematic experience. If your a cinema fan this is a must see for you. Some people are trashing the story, I'd say its a perfect balance and James Cameron has put all together with perfection. The visuals are a whole nother level. I watched it in 3d and I'm ready to watch it again in 3d isense next week. Who ever said never under estimate James Cameron, they are absolutely right. I'll be very shocked if this movie flops at the box office cause I think this movie can't flop. Everyone will love this movie for sure, and it's a movie that people will watch keep coming back to the cinema for. This is a masterpiece and a visual monster."
"Greetings from Lithuania.As a big fan of first ""Avatar"" and even bigger fan of Mr. James Cameron's other movies, I had high hopes for ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" (2022). If there is one blockbuster type movie maker that can always deliver unseen spectacle - its him. And ""Way of Water"" is another proof of that - this movie was incredible in every possible way. If there is a future for huge movie events in theater - this one is the perfect example of it.I won't go into plot but will say that it worked for a sequel - there is a bit of everything, but at its core its a story about family and its connection with nature. The standuot performance to me was Kiri (Sigourney Weaver). She stole every scene she was in. There is a running theme about who her father is, and while there is no answer yet, I think if watched this and previous movies closely and got the overall theme of it, her identity is more then obvious.As for technical stuff - this movie is like no other out there. You have to see it to believe. If the first movie was amazing movie going experience (saw it 3 times back in the day), ""Way of Water"" tops it in every way. The energy of this movie, pacing were superb - during its 3 hours run time never was I bored nor not involved. Music was superb as well.Overall, if you like movies in general, ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is a must see experience. Watch it on the biggest screen possible and 3D - its the way it meant to be seen. The immersion is like no other. Can't wait for a 3rd movie. What a terrific movie."
"Avatar 2 (The Way of Water)- A visual spectacle with plenty of human learnings depicted in an astonishing fashion.James Cameron takes us into his Pandora world inside water and you will definitely hold your breath in several moments and just experience this with ""WOW and ""AWE"".CGI is above and beyond one can imagine- especially in 3D IMAX.Story is not new, but cinematography and visualization keeps you engaged.Wish they trimmed by 30 minutes (3 hours is quite long).James Cameron indeed raises his previous bar with deep bonding and care for the nature. This movie shows emotions beyond one can imagine with family being the core thread. Nature, water, aquatic life and everyone/everything is connected. Everyone has a purpose and meaning to serve.Shell out and enjoy this grandeur in the largest screen possible."
"It's quite Impressive that it has been 13 years since the first movie came out, and yet the visual effects for this epic and long-awaited sequel have been improved in such an incredible way. Chronologically, the events of Avatar: The Way of Water take place 15 years after the events of the first movie. When the People of the Sky are banished from Pandora except those who remained loyal to Sully.SPOILERS AHEAD... In this sequel, we see Jake Sully and Neytiri once again, with their newly formed family of 5 children. Colonel Miles Quaritch returns to Pandora, this time in Avatar Form along with his wisest soldiers who remained loyal to him. Quartich plots a plan to track down and kill Jake Sully, which leads the whole family to move from their home once again, to a reef where more Na'vi People live, called The Metkayina Clan, who show the family their ways, teach them to ride as the Metkayina do, new species underwater, and explore their beautiful reefs. Meanwhile, the threatening and merciless People of the Sky prepare to bring the war on Metkayina territory without even thinking of surrendering nor resting, not until having at least Jake Sully murdered. Of course, they end up failing in the attempt once again. As a conclusion, this sequel is one that no person who watched the first movie can miss."
"Just read the title, it was the exact same movie as the first one, only not as good. The first 45 minutes seems like it should have been at the end of the first movie. It did get interesting when the characters joined the sea people but then it regressed to the same old storyline. Sky people are bad, navi are good. Even the dead villian from the first movie is back, and he's gonna be back in the next movie. WHY? Why would cameron spend so much money to remake a movie he made 10 years ago? Avatar is the marvel franchise now. Cameron is gonna make 6 avatar movies and they will all be the same movie."
"This movie has gone right into my favourites list up with titanic and lalalandThe grand scale and the visuals. The best
Seriously the best so far.It was like titanic
But at war.James Cameron has done a phd in sinking ships 😂😛This is a blockbuster production
A visual art piece
Not just a mere movieWow
Really hats off to the creators.The story?It's was okayThe story telling?World class.This is worth seeing in imax.You might not enjoy it the same on a laptop or tv screen. This marvel is some teenage child in terms of visuals when compared to what Cameron has produced.No seriously
This movies visuals? UncomparableLike how?! This is legit perfectionThe story? James got a simple point - a simple msg to spread
It didn't need a 10yrs in making movie for that message
But nonetheless, maybe it just tell us how important that simple message is.All in all, might just go and watch it again for the visual treat ;)"
"The graphics were amazing. The story, not so much. While I did enjoy a good 50% of the scenes there were also a lot of useless ones. This movie left me with so mant questions that it could have answered in the 3+ hours that is lasts. Would I say it was a waste of money to go watch this movie? No, but it also did not leave me completely satisfied. I believe a lot of people blew this movie up while the story telling was just not as great as the first movie. The intro felt quite long. And is it worth to make a 3rd movie? No. Because it will be the same ""plot twist"" as in the first and second. Besides the graphics and couple of enjoyable scenes this movie didn't have a lot."
"James Cameron, the mastermind behind the epic story of Avatar and its sequel, already revealed the story in the trailers itself. Still, he makes the movie a great experience to watch with his outstanding characterizations and screenplay. Avatar: The Way of Water is an epic action-adventure film that rides on the most stunning visual effects - the 'magic' on the screen looks 'real' for the most part and that bears testimony to the spare-no-effort approach of Cameron and his unit - but like its predecessor it incorporates into its phenomenal sweep topics that are both emotionally engaging and thematically on point.The way James connects both parts (movies) is quite good. He gives a neat explanation and makes things easier for people to understand the connections between the first and second parts. The way he connected some of the key characters from the first part made the film an emotional experience. The beauty of Avatar 2 is not only the Navi people but also the creatures they love. James Cameron shows the emotional bond between the giant creatures called Tulkun and Navi clan in a beautiful manner.The screenplay is a bit slow but it is all to make the proceedings better. Coming to the camerawork, the background score, and sound design, the film has everything perfect to give viewers a spectacular experience. The VFX is just mindblowing. Coming to performances, it's the children who performed well. Their innocence, fighting spirit and zeal to learn new things have been showcased in a good manner. Kiri and Neteyam will leave a solid impression on us once we leave the theater."
"I feared there would be a drop off point in the story like there was in avatar-but I can say there was not. I think that was the most surprising thing, that the story kept moving at a nice pace. Especially for a 3 hour+ movie. The action was phenomenal, the story satisfying and warm. Jake and neytiri as parents is wonderful. We watched in 3d and I felt like maybe it was lacking some color-I want to watch it in regular vision as the colors were one of my favorite parts of the original. I'm a lover of the water so seeing the sully family adapt to the way of the water was a treat. A must see for any avatar fan. I hope Cameron can keep the good momentum on this series to the finish line."
"The good: The visuals obviously, are as good as the first. I like the World of the water people. Great introduction to another part of an interesting World. The whale creatures were very cool. Having another intelligent species with a 3 dimensional backstory was refreshing. The children were also a great addition. Thought I wouldn't like them, but they were interesting, and had a purpose.The bad: I HATE when sequels bring back characters that were killed off in the previous story. You mean to tell me you can't come up with a new villain?! Like the first movie, I also HATE when humans are just evil. I know we are the villains here, but humanity on the whole does not take pleasure in the death and torture of others. I mean, we even care about animals and won't kill them without reason. Sure, some humans are bad, but virtually every human in this movie was evil, and proud to be it, just like the first movie. Just hate the 1 dimensional nature of the humans. Their motivation to kill in this one was even weaker than the first. Yes, money is always a Cameron motivation for bad humans, but they came back just to kill Sully? Nope, doesn't make sense. And what is with Spider??? Is he a traitor or a friend? He helps the bad guys but is friends with the good guys. His character makes no sense. And yes, it is TOO LONG!!,Don't get me wrong, it's not an awful movie. But Cameron is a much more clever writer than this. Look at Terminator and T2. Solid, well written movies. Aliens, another great movie, well written. Though Avatar had interesting characters, the core writing didn't make sense and Cameron is known for doing better."
"A nice visual attraction with a completely average, not overly engaging story.If you compare David Fincher and James Cameron, Fincher is a man who have Theater a Cameron have carousel. It depends on what you expect from it. Definitely not an experience where you engage your brain. If you want to be intoxicated by the visual gluttony, just go to the theater, but dont expect nothing more.I hope Cameron someday tries to make an above average movie in a normal time limit instead of getting lost in his own world and imagination more than decade and refreshes himself on what movies are really about."
"There's little to get excited about unfortunately. The story is thin with the sky people pursuing Jake Sully and his family so they abandon their forest life and take their place among the ocean island people. There they find themselves living like fish out of water and their teenage children go head to head with the sea teenagers. This teenage angst goes on a while and there's a bit about a monster sea creature rescuing one of the Sully boys whose been put in danger. There's lots of big boats and artillery and guns and marines and we're gonna get you and your family stuff, and there's a feral white boy whose father is the guy who's out to get Sully. All pretty cliched. Nothing original. Overlong, overblown and apart from the pretty visuals, quite boring. I really wish it wasn't but why do they think that a story has to have marines blowing everything and everyone to hell?"
"It would offer a good experience if you had watched it in 3D. If not, it is alright too. Especially if you just want to find out if the story is engaging enough for you to sit for 3 hours. No end credits scenes, by the way.Didn't find the story to be boring - didn't catch a wink or any washroom breaks. However, when I left the cinema, I didn't find myself wanting to watch it again. Might re-watch when it's on Disney+ just to concentrate on the dialogue rather than the CGI.It could be that story & character wise, I didn't manage to find anything new / interesting / relatable. Maybe I couldn't help comparing to the 1st one.It looked and felt like it was a revenge driven plot, besides the usual theme of nature conservation, etc.At this point, I don't know whether to look forward to seeing Part 3, but when it comes out, I probably will go see it in the cinema, just to see whether there will be something more in terms of character and plot development."
"Definitely the longest movie I've seen in a theater since The Batman and to me very worth it! Seems to be a fair amount of complaints I usually appreciate most everything and any flaws Way of Water has is voided out. Entire movie is astonishing visually, thrilling action, perfected movements in every aspect, very engaging, plenty of emotions worthy of nominations and great story maybe that's a problem to some but to me entirely well constructed! Avatar: The Way of Water is spectacular deserving of praise crazy to think there's gonna be 6 of them in the works; I have autism I'm more quirky than most and I like to think part 2 just as good if not better than one I'd highly recommend it."
"Avatar the way of water is a truly stunning masterpiece with a lot of heart , emotion and action sequences. The 3D was something to behold and absolutely amazing underwater scenes. The 3 hours fly by for this incredible achievement in cinema experience, I loved all the new chracters especially the children and Spider was an excellent human character. The sky people are great villains who's state of the art equipment is used to try and crush the Navi resistance but the Navi have all the tools to fight back leading to an epic climactic battle on the water, you have never sceen such an awesome battle put to screen before. Go see it no disappointments at all. 10/10."
"Anyone who is not a fan of the first film will hardly like this one. Avatar maintains the same identity, maintains the same structure and the vast majority of its positive and negative points.This story begins in a more exciting way than the first film, with a strong first scene that forces Jake Sully and Neytiri to move from their home. They now have a family - with four children - and that's where Avatar changes the most. This is a movie very much about family. It is no longer about discovering love, but about how to protect and bring out the best in that family. This is a very interesting change and it results because all the young people have very distinct and exciting personalities, often having the most prominence in this film. Don't worry though! The other main themes are still there: colonisation, imperialism, racism, militarism, spirituality and environment.The 2nd act repeats the ""discovery of a new world"" that we saw in the first. Here it is about the aquatic world, which is fantastic, beautiful, and fascinating. However, it's too much. What should have been 20 minutes turns into more than 40 minutes of James Cameron showing off his new toys, asking us ""and this one, huh? Beautiful, right? Perfect, right?"". The plot is forgotten for several minutes and this could have completely gone awry. It doesn't happen because an epic and brutal third act is filled with high stakes, amazing action scenes and enormous tension. The ending convinces even as an open door. Several strong roots are left for the future.Although narratively the film is a little lost at times, its sound is fantastic and visually it's as fascinating as possible. As I'm not even the biggest fan of the technique, I was impressed by what Cameron did at 48fps engaging with very subtle transitions than I expected and a high level of spectacularity. Many will say that it looks like a video game, but I personally loved it. I'm a fan of aquatic films, so it was particularly exciting to see that bright and colourful world that also gives us the fantastic characters that are the tulku (a species of whales). Despite feeling simultaneously like an opening piece and a structural repetition, this is very entertaining, a good time at the cinema and I'm already looking forward to returning to Pandora in 2024."
After 13 years since the first movie I saw one year after 2009 to 2010 with my dad I was absolutely blown away by an amazing story and seeing Zoe Saldana playing Neytiri really made me feel like a teenager again 12 years ago 2010 . James Cameron did a better job directing this movie than the first movie he directed 13 years . The cgi still looks the same as 2009 13 years ago . The story takes place after the humans go back to earth and Jake stays on Pandora to spend his life with Neytiri and raise his family. The kids we're so awesome and the blue reef Navis we're even more cooler . Kate winslet hasn't worked with Cameron since the 90s after playing rose in titanic. But seeing her play a sea Navi was more exciting than titanic 25 years ago . Sigourney weaver did a remarkable job playing graces Navi daughter and I for one found that pretty well done and kinda of emotional . Stephen lang did an even better job playing quaritch in Navi form was absolutely brilliant and a better story for the villain. I have to say way of water was so amazing and more exciting than ever before. The kids were more important to the story than the parents were . Spider who was the coIonels son knew that trusting a bad man was not his place . I hope in the next avatar movie I see Parker and more places to go on Pandora and hopefully Neytiri meets one of her half siblings or cousins and they share the same plot as Jake sully . Or maybe just maybe they'res another family member on Pandora that has the same genes as Jake sully .James Cameron welcome back to Pandora.
"I think it's fair to say 2022's ""Avatar: The Way of The Water"" does to the inexorably successful, groundbreaking 2009 box office juggernaut what ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" & ""Aliens"" commendably did to the original installments in their iconic, respective sci-fi franchises & thus, somehow (despite many people's cynical doubts) against all odds, the indomitable force of nature James Cameron is once again responsible for some of the most impressive filmmaking & world building put to screen in a movie sequel I've seen... Arguably ever, throughout the history of cinema, expanding upon the first's narrative with a consistency, discipline, truthfulness & austere maturity that I can't help but find utterly staggering to witness.Vital lessons have been learned, amendments have been meticulously made & the tailored refinements result in a product that carefully improves upon the original astonishingly, developing both the ensemble & the software used to bring them to life efficaciously. For example, just as the reality that the world around us has evolved (both technologically & societally) since the initial film's explosion in to the stratosphere of pop culture, so has the story set upon the planet of Pandora & the characters housed within its vast, bioluminescent expanses have noticeably grown wiser, more weary in contrast to when we last saw them (understandably jaded from their traumatic experiences), adding beautifully realised layers of depth to their characterisations which enhance the narrative by providing it with a level of emotional complexity & moral ambiguity that its predecessor was perhaps devoid of, by comparison (though I never previously realised it before until now); rather than continuing with capturing the leads in their youth, naively pursuing reckless ambitions of devout martyrdom & glory amidst a sea of banshees & bullets, bravely endangering themselves for a righteous cause they strongly believe in, the writers alternatively make the inspired decision to highlight how the creation of a family unit can drastically alter one's responsibilities, allegiances & values, shifting the stakes considerably - with their actions lensed through the perspective of parenthood - bringing their earlier valiant behaviours in to disrepute & consequently theorising that given the alteration in conditions, perhaps stoically warring against perceived inevitability (in a futile quest for pride, retribution or liberation) isn't worth the price paid when the toll inflicted is no longer potentially just with your life, but it could equally be exacted upon the lives of those whom you hold dearest? Due to this, maybe it's even selfish & sanctimonious? Subsequently, many fascinating, philosophical questions are asked (though particular emphasis is placed upon theorising whether one's definition of selflessness changes, depending on the person's unique situation) & the lines between incorruptible good / bad become less distinguishable when we're confronted with the notion that these new relationships aren't necessarily strengths or weaknesses, nor is the premise as simple as we'd prefer it to be; inherent traits of love V evil give way to far more nuanced expressions of humanity (& inhumanity, as either side is capable of expressing both in their own authentic way, when provoked), allowing for dramatic tension & naturally occuring conflict - that's engaging & deliciously complicated - to arise magnificently from those subtle dynamics. Moreover, the script intelligently possesses a frank (& genuinely honest) acknowledgment that maintaining fragile peace (sought to preserve one's bloodline) ironically comes at a personal cost, just as much as disturbing it does - & therefore, the legendary director uses the 3+ hour runtime to forensically analyse which approach is plausibly more destructive in the long term (to their sense of self & surroundings, for is tranquility simply delaying the unavoidable?) & he dares to debate whether fighting is ultimately worth the risk, in the grand scheme of things - or perchance, if passivity / cowardice is the only defensible method of guaranteeing the preservation of native people & the longevity of their sacred traditions? In addition to that, the children are used remarkably to highlight how the legacy created from such profound, past achievements can haunt those who are destined to try & step out from under that dauntingly monumental shadow in the future. Hence, it's not just an exploration of a strained family dynamic (when put under immense pressure), but how one lives up to the standards set by our forebears, whose successes have set a seemingly insurmountable high standard, for which they find themselves hesitant as to whether they could realistically achieve parity with in the present. Ergo, they're not simply battling the worst of humanity & the physical manifestations of it, but they are equally in perpetual conflict with their own demons & insecurities, internally - fighting on a physical & emotional level. Quite poetic, don't you think - considering the conditions of this hotly anticipated release?Special acknowledgement must also be made to the notably naturalistic way in which the series has developed too; seldom do tales progress so organically, with such effective & relative ease, flourishing like a tree, with its branches protruding outwards; characters behave in surprisingly conceivable ways, respond consistently to events as they unfold (where we can sympathise with their choices) & never rely on forced, artificially constructed moments of convenient contrivance to justify furthering the plot; each member of the ensemble is relatable, distinguished, flawed & set on a tightly focused journey that incredibly never deviates from their clear & unique path. Thus, the reach of this spans far further than before & yet irrespective of Cameron's bulging scale & undeniable grandiosity, the heart & intimacy is still never lost amongst the chaos of the ensuing carnage. Due to this, the soul captured magically in ""Avatar"" is resultantly retained unquestionably throughout & by the credits, everyone's arcs have come to a rewarding conclusion (until the next chapter). Heck, I'd say this feels even more personal & sincere - evocatively daring to provoke & challenge the audience with audacious creative decisions that may genuinely unsettle (a major gamble for a production of this size & magnitude) but thematically, it's faultlessly coherent, echoing the relevant, pre-established ecological messaging, gifting viewers with an experience that seems satisfyingly accurate, given the trajectory of their collective advancements.Speaking of which, if you thought the Oscar winning pioneer was willing to relinquish his title as the embodiment of what it means to be a visionary, industry defining trailblazer... Think again; paired with his veteran ""Titanic"" & ""True Lies"" cinematographer Russell Carpenter, even solely from a technical point of view, the duo have visually revivified the theatre going experience in a manner which can only be described as ""seismic"" & it's hard to imagine that this hasn't substantially changed the game forever, henceforth. You have not witnessed real epic spectacle until you've laid eyes on the fruits of their labour. In the same way we were given a glimpse of what to expect from productions years in advance before, so too are we, presently. It is a total, ingenious reinvention.Can't believe I'm saying this for a third consecutive time but he's essentially presented us with another masterpiece, formed from the hands of a goliath, unstoppable storyteller, operating confidently at the height of his power, showcasing a project that's irrefutably awe inspiring, spinning so many plates in the air & yet miraculously not dropping a single one, pushing each & every creative department involved in the feature's inception to its limit until boundaries are broken & inconceivably transcended. See it on the biggest screen possible (IMAX 3D) & prepare yourself, as if you're like me, you'll quickly be resisting the urge to attend repeat screenings, frequently - merely to absorb it all more thoroughly. I cannot recommend it highly enough. There's so much to process & digest but I seriously adored it."
"""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is a film of tremendous quality, James Cameron directed and co-wrote this story with social criticism and quite human, something that he had presented before, but he always does it from a different and profound perspective. The cinematography is wonderful, mainly in underwater scenes, achieving powerful and beautiful visuals. The special effects are good, although in a couple of scenes they can look a bit unreal. The soundtrack is amazing, especially the action and suspense scenes. The greatest success is the script, as I mentioned before, it focuses on a story that deals with the problems of planet Earth but seen from the fictional Pandora, the human destroying everything in its path and what is different. Once you've walked out of the movie theater, remember ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" and its message, drop the cants about it making you cry during its run on screen but out there you're back to being a person who treats your family badly or a neighbor. Do not belittle an animal either. The film's message is clear, live it in the cinema and in your daily life. Also remember that the plot of the film revolves around adapting and knowing good things around you but which you were unaware of or feared. A great movie and a possible winner of several Academy Awards next year."
"Had to travel 3 hrs from my City to the Capital to see this in IMAX 3D.Totally worth the efort, it was the most spectacular movie I've seen in Cinema since Dune, and Dune actually looks like a low budget film made for TV, compared to this beast.Cameron is indeed the master of seaquels!Avatar 2 is better than the first installement in almost every aspect.This movie didn't hold back on anything, it didn't shy away even from a bit of on screen violence, which was not a gratuitous one.A must see in Cinema, not only for the fantastic imagery, but also for the sound editting and The Soundtrack.I had a blast seeing it and the competion for edditing, sound design, special effects for the next Oscars will be unfair for the others.I would preorder tikets for the next Avatar movie!"
"Second part to James Cameron's box office hit from 2009.I had to watch first part again today because i had forgotten very much of it.This was quite good decision definitely.This one was definitely faitful and really entertaining sequel to that.Good action scifi film.Visually really impressive.Really long film and so much stuff had been stuffed in story.This definitely had similar problems that first had.While story in first one felt quite generic 2000's scifi story, in this story was definitely more modern.And still something quite generic what we see nowadays quite a bit in similar films.Again we have greedy humans that want resources from alien planet with some new tricks of course.Now main characters from first film have formed family that they need to protect.We see nice outcast story when they go live with water aliens that are different than these tree aliens.Again main characters need to learn new things from this new aliens.And of course they need to do cooperation to defeat common enemy.It seems that i have seen all this before in many things.All that water stuff was really cool definitely.Good performances.I honestly don't know how there will be even three more of these films.Of course in end of this film is quite obvious Deus Ex Machina written in this that allows new films.Or actually this film begins with one big Deus Ex Machina because every story needs familiar villain.I will most likely watch other parts of this series because i have gotten this far."
"I had an option to watch this in ICE 3D and Imax 3D. But went for later, didn't want to experiment with the new technology. But now if I get a chance want to experience this cinematic beauty in ICE 3D too.Let's get straight to the point, this is James Cameron film, you will obviously see lot of water, the guy has put in everything he has learned over the years form his films. I personally didn't feel any lag, the progression was great. But some would say he spent lot of unnecessary time showing underwater scenes; but for me every single minute was a bliss, it defined the emotions and the feelings.I've read somewhere, one of the editors of the films said it raw. When they showed the first cut version to James; he became furious and told them to put every damn 190 minute of the film back; this is James for you.It's been 13yrs since the first Avatar, and hence this had to stand to the experience we had with the first one. With all the latest technologies; there was something new we all needed, and it was present in this.Coming to plot, yes it's a very simple plot. Nothing new, family is more important; they stay together, fight together. This I'm telling in simple words, but James will make you emotional watching it on screen.Definitely there are some plot holes, I won't write it here, then it's a major spoiler. But Avatar 2 stands for itself than one; it's a buildup for the 3rd."
"No plot, no real story and dialogue written by a three year old in crayon on a bus window. In fact it felt like Tron, if instead of being sucked off into an 80s game cabinet, Jeff Bridges had ended up in an colourful children's game that teaches them to count and recognise letters. No zooming around on light bikes but plenty of Herby the Rainbow Unicorn showing you how to spell S***t.I'm not sure what has happened to poor James Cameron. I mean he's always been an average director whose ego often outstrips his talent but this has to be a career low. Which is saying something, as this is the man who made the first Avatar. Which was basically the 'great white saviour' trope applied to Smurfs. Stay at home for this one."
"This movie, or should I say, video game story is a familiar product from 2009. The difference from its predecessor being that the focus feels forcefully transported from the forest to the ocean just to show off the underwater motion capture technology they waited so long to mature, yet better capture technology still could not cover up the distracting flaws from bad facial acting. The storyline flaws from the last movie, unfortunately, seemed to be exemplified from being cliché to straight up illogical and self-repeating; and the movie should no longer rely solely on the immersive visuals to stand as a landmark movie."
"Remarkable Movie. James Cameron is a legend in creating worlds and universes. If only he is interested in comics and save DC from itself. Anyway the movie is amazing. New world and new views. I took my 5 years old daughter and she was amazed with the colors and the sea world that JC created, he simply outdid himself in that one. The movie is 3 hours and 15 minutes long yet time goes by with feeling it. You will not be bored, you will be amazed. According to JC he will created 3 more giving a total of 5 movies to tell such an epic tale. Hope it will end perfectly same as it started as I believe 5 movies around pandora is too much but let's wait and see. Highly recommended in IMAX."
I love this movie a lot. I personally feel like the action and the special effects are way better than they were in the first movie. I also like the darker vibe it takes towards the last half. With that being said the story overall is very convoluted. Especially with the amount of characters that are in the movie. Sometimes the characters do things without any explanation and it feels more like shock value then something the character would actually do and it's hard to connect with them. But overall it was an extremely fun movie and I have never seen visuals like this in my entire life. You definitely need to experience it in the theater. Also the villain Quaritch is the best part of the movie. I am looking forward to the next one though. I feel like there's going to be a lot less set up in the third movie and it's going to be a much more enjoyable story. But for me personally I loved the underwater stuff and I really genuinely cared about the message more in this one. I think that's what James Cameron cares about more is that you connect more of the message than you do with the characters.
"The recycled villain is just silly and the fact that he's still... 'alive' even at the end of this film is just ridiculous! The actor must have some contract to fulfil... All in all, fantastic audio and visual experience with lovely messages and morals just
like the first film. There were some nice new characters and old but there were also plenty of boring new ones. Basically this movie is: Jake and family go on a vacation to Sea World in order to get away from the exact same recycled plot and villain from the first film. There were some differences luckily but everyone will see the similarities. The continuation and utilisation of the spiritual tones were as lovely and meaningful however and that was done beautifully. :)"
"James Cameron knows how to make a movie. What a emotional roller coaster of a ride that was full of suspense, and joy to watch. Every scene had something new to watch. Kate Winslet was not easy to recognize. You will see a lot of familiar characters from Part 1, including some borrowed scenes from the movie Titanic. Also, there were too many characters to keep track off, also the plot was little thin however, they set it up very nicely for part III to take place. Watch it 3D for even better experience. The 3+ hours was too much especially for kids who constantly had to go to the bathroom. I really hope part 3 is not 3+ hours."
"AVATAR: THE WAY OF WATER (C) is a big budget cinematic spectacle w/ incredible flaws. Enjoyable world-building, f/x, & action are undermined by:
Flat Main Characters: Jake & the villain are still bland & 1 noteRedundancy: 45 min. Longer than necessary IMOVideo game plotting: So many sequences are just fetch quests over and overHalf Baked Messaging: the story is overloaded with ill-conceiver messaging, themes, and clichesReboot Trap: The sequel falls heavily into the ""soft reboot"" problem of erasing the victories of the previous filmGenre Clash: So many call outs, references, & shifts in tone and genre mirror the messaging - inconsistent.In other words, it's first-class trappings on a third class story. It reminds me of a student who works 30 hours on a 1-hour project and puts all their effort into the art portion that is really only 10% of the rubric and then fails at the 90% content portion. Look, really glad you put the effort into it, but it just doesn't have the substance."
"First of all, it felt refreshing to go to a cinema and see a blockbuster that wasn't another superhero movie. Now I loved the Marvel movies but recent additions have left me wanting something different and Avatar: The Way of Water delivered as a sequel by being better than the first Avatar.It was an emotional ride all throughout with some humour mixed in but it never felt out of place or forced. I was hooked from start to finish and despite the three hour runtime I was left wanting more. Each moment to moment setting felt well paced and never dragged on. It held your interest with good acting and tense, emotional or funny moments.My biggest gripe is the overall plot. It was absolutely a much more original story than the first movie but it was still the weakest aspect of this entire film. I felt for the characters on a moment to moment basis but I enjoyed the character and world building more than the plot.I absolutely reccomend this movie."
"I've waited years for this movie. James Cameron took 13 years to work on this franchise, so that he could make his shots as visually perfect as they can be. The 1st Avatar is one of my all-time favourites. Other than the visuals, that movie had a huge emotional impact on me. So I had a lot of expectations going into this one. I didn't know anything about the plot going in and it's better that way, so I won't go into the details here.So how is the movie? It's definitely a good movie. I don't think it's near as good as the first one. But it's a good movie for sure. The visuals, well they're amazing. Everyone knows that already now. But James Cameron has made a very interesting world here by expanding the Pandora culture. If you don't know already, Avatar 3 was filmed along side Avatar 2 and there are even 2 more films planned afterwards. So you shouldn't expect a concluded story from this one. Cameron has done a good job setting up a large world, some new characters, and unfinished conflicts between them for the future movies. There are also some unanswered questions I'm very curious about. And as I would expect from Cameron, he has directed this movie very well. He has this great ability of making some genuinely emotional scenes. Of course that's also because of the acting which is again great here. There is a very satisfying and well executed action scene towards the end that definitely has a couple of crowd-cheering scene.But I am just a bit disappointed from this movie. Frankly, it's a lot similar to the first one. Not just the story but also the structure. I mean there were many scene-to-scene parallels I could draw from the first one. And this movie just didn't feel that gutsy to me. I mean, definitely, I was on the edge of the seat for most of the time, since there were more characters to care about. But the movie never really showed me some dire consequences. But take the first movie, the scene where the hometree falls, that is one of the best scenes I've seen in cinema. That scene horrified me. Everything about that scene is perfect. That's the level for me, if you want to show something devastating. This movie has a similar scene, but it wasn't of the same scale, and I couldn't really get into this new world, as much as I did in the first movie. Don't get me wrong, this movie is gutsy too. But it's just not as gutsy as the 1st one. Also the pacing didn't seem perfect to me. They went by the first half hour very quickly, and some major developments happened there, so I wish they would've taken some time. Some of the characters from the original don't really seem the same to me. And I understand, it's been 13 years so a character like Jake has more responsibility in this one because of his kids. But Jake just didn't feel like Jake for 3 hours long.Look, you could make the argument that this movie is unoriginal just like the first one. Like, the father-son drama is definitely something similar to what we've seen countless times. But I'm not going to say that because avatar's strength has never been the story. It's the execution, the imaginative world, the emotion, the direction. In the end I would say this is a good movie. Look the first movie is very special to me so it's sort of unfair to compare it to that one. But the similarities in the movies are very evident. I would recommend you to watch it since it's a good movie and the crowd really seemed to enjoy it. I went with a friend and he too walked out satisfied."
"Its a good movie but it has nothing on the first movie, spoilers ahead, its basically a similar story line as the first movie, but worse, bad humans come back, some are looking for Jake, Jake decides to flee to another tribe of blue people, there they are treated like outsiders for a while, just like Jake was in the first movie, most of the movie was about Jake's kids exploring the ocean, which is where the visual part comes in, then the bad guys kill a whale and catch Jake's kids and hold them hostage to lure Jake out, bad guy threatens to kill Jake's kids unless he comes alone, then a whale attacks the boat and then Jake and the rest of the tribe decide to attack, forgetting that his kids are still tied up and the bad guy that threatened to kill his kids is still right there ready to kill his kids, but for some reason doesn't."
"How to describe 'Avatar Way of Water'? It isn't easy because there is nothing else like this series. It has taken over a dozen years to bring the second instalment of the Avatar story to our screens and, in doing so, it has created the usual dichotomy of Avatar 'fans' and Cameron 'haters'. So, what was MY take on this Sequel? Well, firstly I watched this in IMAX 3D, which is the top of the range experience. I would certainly NOT bother with this format for 95% of the other Films out there, however, this is a Cameron production and he does nothing by halves. Having seen the recent 'Avatar' re-release, I anticipated that this would look visually incredible - and it DOES. The VFX are SO far ahead of anything I have seen (it 'trashes' recent MCU efforts like the risible 'Thor: Love & Thunder'). So the VFX and indeed, the fabulous cinematography, are astounding, with the underwater sequences in 3D being particularly stunning and effective.The story has been criticised by many people, probably because it is the ONLY element left TO have a go at, but again, the story is a continuation of the relationship between Jake and Neytiri, only decades after the events in the first Avatar. Briefly, the 'Sky People' are back - yes, those Humans are a real pain - but this time they bring a whole new motive for landing on Pandora AND they bring a 'Quaritch avatar' with them, no doubt because he has the proper motivation to hunt down Jake. Problem is, Jake now has a Family and pretty soon he decides to move from the Forests out beyond the seas to live with the ocean 'na'vi'. Needless to say, it isn't long before the 'Sky People' in the shape of Quaritch, start closing the net...
Yes, a straightforward storyline - as if most Hollywood blockbusters have anything else! - but it is HOW it is executed that counts. All of the characters, from the members of the Sully Family to the 'new' Quaritch are given screen time to develop, extremely unusual in Films this large. The most fascinating is Sigourney Weaver's 'Kiri', who appears to be more than just an 'old soul' in a teenage body.The middle section of the film looks like a nature documentary on 'Pandorian ocean life' and the relationship between the wildlife and the sea Na'vi 'Metkayina' is especially focussed. All this gives way to the third act, a typical Cameron 'tour de force', of a battle between the 'mechanised humans' and the more primitively armed 'Na'vi'.Overall, this is a Film I actually want to go and see AGAIN. It was packed full of detail, much of which viewers would struggle to take in on the first viewing.THIS is exactly why I ignore the 'haters' and also the rather childish reviews of some 'so-called' serious Film Critics, who for some reason write trite reviews that show no objectivity at all.Cameron's greatest skill is to give us something that is entertaining, spectacular AND with a serious underlying message. Unfortunately, there are still cinema-goers who just want to watch movies with NO message at all.Avatar Way of Water wears it's creator's heart on it's sleeve - Cameron does care about the natural world and what we are doing to it. It comes through in every frame of this 3 hour magnum opus.The 'world Building' for just these two Films leaves everything else in the shade and I for one will wait with eagerness for the next Chapter in this saga.Keep going Jim Cameron, I want to see more!"
"James Cameron's technical spectical got me going to the theater for a second time since 2009 and it was a mistake. Even though the film looks impressive at times, at some point I started to realize that I would rather watch a proper nature documentary. The action scenes are well made in a way where the veteran director seems to take all of his greatest hits compilation. 3 hours of video game footage however does not apparently make for a good or even a decent film.The technical spectical is not enough to save this film from awful writing a script that it has. I wasn't expecting Shakespearean drama, but the story and the characters were even more bland and/or non-existent than in the first film. All of the characters have one single motive and none of them are relatable or even likable. The story itself is an excuse for the mass violent spectacle happening on the screen. Even though the Na'vi are fighting the American imperialists, they seem to have adopted all of their core values: patriarchy, nuclear family, violence as a virtue, chastity of body and having a gun fetish. Their supposed connectness with nature seems more like one what middle class people from the western world experience while on a holiday in a tropical island, than what actual indigenous people have.James Cameron, you can trick me twice but I will not make the same mistake three times and will happily skip the rest of Avatar films."
"To be frank, I was certainly disappointed with the trailer of this movie. I even thought of carrying a pill, because watching a boring plot in 3D for more than 3 hours would be a perfect recipe for headache.Oh man, James Cameron proved me wrong, in most pleasant way.Plot-wise, Avatar 2 is just a remake of its sibling. But add 10 years effort of one of the most talented directors, boom, we are pulled into a magic world.Watch it in IMAX 3D, even if it means you must take half a day leave from your work. It provides out of the world experience, literally.Word of caution: clear your tank, carry enough snacks.. story-wise, you can miss any scene without losing the track. But it would look super weird when you come out of the water world, and step into the rest room :-)"
"If all you care about is how the footage looks just go watch some random stock footage you can find great random 4k videos which'd be more interesting then thisi mean i expected this to be poor just not that much... it's basically exactly like the same film exactly the same only amplifying,magnifying every possible bit of cringe and generic empty dialogue from part 1there aren't any great additions to the world or story or anything there's no much of a story really
plot wise it's as predictable as you'd expect it to be if we were talking about a f type movie.Really i had some hope that in 3 hours after 13 years of writing there'll be something anything interesting and unpredictable but nope(you can pick any random movie you like with a score of 3 or less and with bikini 3 times in the title or something like that
and i guarantee the plot would be more interesting and well written )i mean this is absurd
where did all those millions go into the graphics.Seriously you'll be better served watching paint dry don't waste 3 hours of you're life not to mention money on this moviei can't explain the high score so far i suppose a combination of bots and censorship and the tiny amount of fans to've rushed to watch this spammed a high score but i'm willing to put a lot of money on that it'll soon come downunlike in 2009 no one's talking about it. The graphics aren't as revolutionary/...
and the only reason i watched it was because i had nothing better to do and yet the only reason i finished it is that i could give this review
seriously you'll be served better watching pain dry it'll be funnier less cringworthy and boring."
"Just saw it at Science Museum IMAX in London and immediately fell in love with the movie. This is one of the most beautiful experiences I have ever had in my life. James Cameroon is a cinematic genius. Worth the 13 years wait. Astonishingly beautiful.From start to finish the movie keeps you engaging, making you more and more indulged in Pandora's world. And this time the Pandora's world is even more beautiful underwater.I know there are some talks of story being weak and unliked by critics, I would just say that go and see for yourself, you'll not be bored even for a second. It is awe inspiring and wonderfully made. What else people want?Go see it in IMAX and enjoy!"
"The haters are desperate to find ways to dig into this movie. Don't buy it. This is a landmark achievement, and pop entertainment not only at its finest, but pushing deep into new frontiers. The visual mastercraft of this film barely needs to even be mentioned. Haters will have you believe this film has ""no plot."" Or ""a weak script."" The fact is, James Cameron and team had my wife bawling her eyes out over a fictional, CG whale. I was rooting, crying, and cheering out loud for weird blue Smurf athletes over genuine human characters. I was left emotionally exhausted after the (admittedly long) 3.5 hour experience from all the highs and lows. Were these feelings driven by great visual effects? No. They were driven by a genuinely exciting, moving story, with characters I was invested in 100%. And that's more to say than 99% of the rest of the drivel Hollywood dishes out. James Cameron (and by extension, his creative team) are in an extremely rare position in the film industry. They have almost unlimited resources at their disposal, and unchecked creativity. And unlike most other studios and filmmakers in that position, they delivered. This is not fan service. It's not pandering to some larger brand strategy or IP. This is pure drive to make the best damn movie possible. And holy Avatar, they did it."
"Avatar 2 was amazing. It was so engrossing that it only felt an hour long, and just like when I saw the original in theaters 13 years ago, even as it was ending I wanted it to keep going.I didn't realize how long it's been since I've gone to see a movie and actually get to have an experience while watching it. I was so into the movie that i actually found myself forgetting my surroundings and completely getting immersed into the movie.I loved the story, even if it was classic, but I think what I loved the most were all the new characters and the bond between them. Not just the avatars, but also the Tulkans and all the other new creatures we got to see on Pandora. The bond between the Tulkans and Avatars especially was very touching to see.Avatar 2 also feels like a huge set up for what's to come, and I'm very excited to see what comes next. This is one of the best movies i have seen, just like the first one. Thank you James Cameron for another amazing experience."
"James Cameron is bringing us back into the mysterious world of Pandora, an Earth-like planet somewhere in space, where the Avatars live. What is most remarkable for this sequel is that you don't need to know about or remember any details from the first movie to dive into this story at all. The visual effects are incredibly made, and most worthwhile to watch in 3D. With love for details in its flora and fauna, this foreign world is brought to life. At the core, this movie is focused on the bond of family under challenging circumstances, as well as about adapting to a new environment.This film should be credited for resurrecting of one of the most memorably ferocious villains in recent cinematic history. It is also a very reflective story line about humankind or here referred to as the ""Sky People"" who invade and destroy unknown territories before trying to find peaceful ways. This film is the best this holiday season from its visual execution as well as from its storyline and is highly recommended to everyone."
"Easily the best visually stunning and beautiful movie I've ever seen. Hands down. Solid movie. James Cameron created a beautiful universe which you feel a part of the entire time. The whole cast did an amazing job. Even though the movie is long, it's enjoyable and entertaining throughout. Great action scenes. The underwater scenes are visually stunning! Better visuals, effects, and even the is better story than the first Avatar. Can't imagine what the other sequels will look like in the future. Definitely a movie to see in the theatre in 3D with the whole family!! Excited for the future sequels! This is the type of movie you get your moneys worth!"
"Avatar doesn't offer a complex storyline with twists, but instead you get the chance to experience again for more than 3 ours the world of Pandora. The movie delivers to the viewers exactly what if wants, a cinematic experience. It doesn't take long before you get dragged into the movie and bond with the characters. The overall CGI is just breathtaking beautiful and sometimes you even forget that you are watching a computer generated world.Some negative aspects of the movie are the (again) stereotypical villains, simple storyline and repetitive concept from the first part.Overall, a must watch."
"James Cameron is one of my favorite filmmakers of all time, I do not believe he has made a bad movie, and he keeps that streak alive with Avatar: Way of Water. He has once again reset the standard of what is possible with CGI, but should visuals alone be the sole factor in assessing this movie's greatness. Throughout the history of cinema, movies are evaluated on their presentation and story to put it simply.If Avatar 2 (To keep the wordcount down) gets a 100% A+ for visuals, then I have to be honest in giving it a solid B for its story. While I agree with Cameron's choice to keep the story simple in the first one to allow for more time to be spent word building. It in a lot of ways works to the detriment of this movie.Characters from Jake Sully to Neteyam & Lo'ak, the Sully sons, and numerous others just fill their typical archetypes. Protective father, rebel son, ""force-sensitive"" child, etc.It may seem harsh but the greatest franchises are almost always built on equally great characters whether it be via their backstory, motivations, or an actor/actresses performance.However maybe the movies greatest sin is committed with my two favorite characters from the first film being Neytiri & Colonel Quaritch. Neytiri is suspicious sidelined in this movie with really no arc or true impact to the story except for maybe the best scene of the movie in the final act. At the same time, Colonel Quaritch while having a lot more to do then Neytiri is booged down by a nonsensical backstory and no character growth except for the final act. I'll admit he fulfills the main purpose of a villain by being an intimidating threat, but when you're arc is basically a repeat of the previous movie....
The first thing I thought when I left this movie is what Corridor Crew (VFX React Channel) will have to say! Today studios for the most part have gotten stagnant with pushing the VFX envelope, and VFX artists are asked to create spectacle with minimal time. This movie shows firsthand when you have a vision, talent, and time what can be accomplished. The result are images that show exactly why I am a valued AMC Stubs member, and also why movie theatres aren't going anywhere anytime soon.Immense credit goes to James Cameron for knowing what he wants, having an idea of what he needs to shoot, and putting together a capable team. And despite his shortcomings in characters, his vision for fleshing out Pandora, its lore and other territories truly makes it feel like one of the most immersive fictional worlds since Star Wars.Credit and respect must also be given to Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, and all of the other Na'vi character actors. Similar to voice acting, I believe it almost takes more talent to capture the human nuances in a digital character and that is achieved by each actress and actor though the same can't exactly be said for the human counterparts.As I'll reiterate, James Cameron has created another amazing film that improved upon its predecessor in the story where needed. I do have to ask the question, how far can this franchise go. I thought the 2nd movie would emphatically answer that a la Cameron's Aliens. Yet for the most part it hits most of the same beats as the first one and in conclusion, WOW essentially begins and ends with the visuals. Are 3 more movies that are essentially pretty to look at but not much else going to justify a billion dollar production price tag?We will see, but in the meantime I'll refuse to doubt Mr. Cameron."
"An absolute 3 hour MasterClass in filmmaking. Sheer entertainment and art collide in an astonishing way. Being underwater through the perspective of an IMAX camera made the waves as beautiful and dangerous as they are in real life. The action sequences are unbelievable.With James Cameron pushing the envelope underwater this year with IMAX, and Joseph Kosinski & Tom Cruise of Top Gun Maverick pushing the envelope in the Air, Cinema is far from dead. A great year to be at the movies.I recommend seeing it in IMAX 3D, that is the best possible format for this movie. It was shot with 3D imax cameras. You will get the biggest screen possible and the 3d won't feel cheap."
"Let's be honest here. Nobody enjoyed the first one for the story. They enjoyed it for the amazing visuals, world building, and epic battle scenes. This film delivers on all of that. The underwater scenes were so cool. The shots James Cameron was able to get were astounding. Taking you under water with the characters and animals. This is a film you have to see on the big screen though. If you're not in awe watching this then something is wrong with you. I don't want to hear how the plot wasn't intricate. It doesn't have to be. I know the pandemic delayed this coming out but I'm not sure if they would've been able to make this 4 or 5 years ago. Regardless it's something you should experience."
"Turns out, Jack and Rose didn't need a bigger door to survive, they just needed a Tulkun fin that could fit five Na'vis. With his exceptional zeal for the ocean and water, James Cameron returns with the revived Avatar series after 13 years. When all hopes seem lost for CGI as Marvel disappoints us in a string of controversies, The Way of Water demonstrates yet again the pinnacle of visual effects from this decade, defining what immersive experience truly means as the audience roams the soul-capturing sceneries of Pandora. In addition to the otherworldly techniques, the movie's cinematography, aesthetic design, and biome layout continue to be superb and meticulous, elaborating a dissimilar yet equally appealing face of the planet. It is extremely unusual for a sequel to be produced with this level of sincerity, as I am awed with satisfaction and surprise.(Spoilers and criticisms ahead) Although maintaining the technological quality, the original film's central plot of natives versus colonizers has been simplified into colonel Quaritch's personal vendetta against Jake's family, which, despite saving the time to establish numerous intriguing characters, dilutes the depth of the story. Speaking of characters, both Jake and Neytiri's roles have been greatly reduced to fulfill Lo'ak's dynamic, whose identity crisis and journey of adaption are perceptibly trivial compared to his father's. Kiri's mystical connection to Grave and Eywa is hinted throughout but ends up unexplained; Spider's lineage and relation to Quaritch could have been a major twist especially after Neytiri's frenzy, yet are also left unresolved; Ronal, performed by Kate Winslet, can be portrayed as a queen with traits beyond Mo'at, but simply disappears from the final battle. Not to mention, the reef tribe's tolerance of the Sullys seems rather insensible knowing that the sky people are hunting for them. Too many characters to sketch, and too many threads to knot, as the movie is forced to sacrifice good narration and tempo.However, if ignoring my high expectation, the film's not half bad compared to most other sequels: complete storyline, likable protagonists, and absolutely mind-bending effects. At the very least, I did not feel drowsy at all throughout the three-hour watching. Disregard the cost, find the best theater in the neighborhood, and submerge yourself in The Way of Water."
"But it does have its issues.The plot is very similar to the first one (interesting and action packed in the first third, a bit baggy in the middle and a full on actioner for the last hour). It's also too long. At three hours, I was never bored but my bum did give up.On the plus side it does look fabulous. The cinematography, the CGI rendering and the sheer beauty does put most Marvel movies to shame. The script maybe a little basic and explain the plot constantly but it was definitely never boring to look at.Do to sum up, if you liked the first you will like this. And if you didn't, well, just stay way."
"At the very best I would rate this 5, just for the visuals, and even that includes some bad CGI on a couple of occasions which I thought was really bad coming from James Cameron. The boat crashing scene just looks like something from a 90s computer game.Avatar 2 is so inferior to Avatar 1, I could not stress that enough. It is missing so many elements that made the first movie, with an absolutely empty pointless story that seems to be mish-mashed into the visuals. Avatar 2 has none of the mystic feeling energy that the first one had. And after a 13 year wait, I just felt so disappointed with the movie, not reaching any expectations whatsoever.There are reviews listed here, mentioning 'best film ever', 'best ever CGI', 'Oscar material' etc etc... either it's their first trip to the cinema or they have never seen a good film to compare it to.Overall it's just one big empty snoozefest with visuals."
"Never mind that people died in the last film. This is the future and Pandora. Let's bring them back or a reasonable facsimile. Jake becomes leader and has a family. In addition there is Kiri, related to Grace and father to be named later and Spider, the human son of the evil Colonel Quaritch who we get to see die again from the last film, but he's somewhat still around. Spider speaks Nav'i and are part of the group. The ""Sky People"" return as they have built back better. They need the planet because Earth is still dying. Their main goal is to kill Jake Sully. To protect the tree people he goes and hides out with the water tribe, who accept them with much reservation. His sons are a chip off the old block and at this point imagine the first film done underwater with the son making a connection with an animal unattainable. Same beautiful scenery except this time it is under the sea. Don't cry for me Argentina, I am sure whoever dies in this feature will be back on the next one depending on the box office and fan reaction aka Mr Spock. I am really getting tired of people who hunt and kill animals having an emotional connection and going off the deep end when one dies. Take the crying and screaming down a notch."
"Hatts of to JAMES CAMERON for creating such a beautiful world to experience it and to dive in for like 3 and half hours. First of all it doesn't feel like 3 hours has passed when you sat to watch on the film. The film is so mesmerising like you can feel every bit of the scenes that the director is trying to show. The way James Cameron designs his characters, species and the whole world is just powerful and I don't think anyone can nearly touch him in this kind of things. He doesn't focus on story but the way he gives time to his characters the world building the visual experience scenes that shows how creative he is. VISUALS in this film is on another level. It feels like you are actually diving in the water world experience. The animals that he created for water world is just amazing to see their design & the making of this creatures is so damn good. There are many characters in the movie but by the end of the film you'll easily know all characters because that's the creativity of James Cameron. He gives every character its time to perform and to build the story for the perfect conclusion. Actors are powerful and specially all cast has done tremendously well job. As compare to part 1 part 2 is very strong in Visuals, Emotions, Actions but lack of human side this time because the director has more focused on the water world and it's visuals. Try to watch this in as big screen as possible. And if you love the 1st one then this will blow your mind...."
"Avatar: The Way of Water continues with the story of Jake Sully(Sam Worthington) & his partner Neytiri(Zoe Saldana), after the events of Avatar(2009). Jake & Neytiri have a family of five children & are raising them in Pandora. When an old foe returns to finish what he started, Jake & Neytiri must join forces with the Na'vi army to protect their family.Avatar: The Way of Water is a mind-blowing film. Director James Cameron always reminds us about the novelty of the theatrical experience & redefines cinema, each time he returns to the director's chair. The visual effects are jaw-dropping & surpasses its 2009 predecessor which is the highest grossing movie of all time. The performance capture is phenomenal & is the highlight. The action set pieces are fantastic. The 3D is eye-popping, especially in IMAX. Story wise, Avatar(2009) surpasses this film. The story of this movie is quite basic. That is its only flaw. Sam Worthington is outstanding as Jake. Zoe Saldana is spectacular as Neytiri. Sigourney Weaver is awesome as Kiri. Stephen Lang is brilliant as Quaritch. Kate Winslet & Cliff Curtis are excellent as Ronal & Tonowari, respectively. Jamie Flatters, Britain Dalton, Trinity Jo-Li Bliss, Jack Champion & Bailey Bass are incredible as Neteyam, Lo'ak, Tuk, Spider & Tsireya, respectively. The supporting cast is impressive. Avatar: The Way of Water is a must watch for Avatar(2009) & James Cameron fans. Watch it on the biggest screen possible & have a whale of a time!"
"I have watched this movie on the world largest screen in Leonberg in IMAX 3D and I was blown away. I haven't got such a feeling before. It was just magical.To see the really amazing VFX on an IMAX screen in 3D was so amazing and the VFX were so much better than in the first one. And I mean they were really really good. The story was good and with the new characters, James Cameron once again topped himself.The movie was a little bit too long in my opinion but that's ok. There is a thing that is mentioned and really present in a scene but isn't explained or mentioned after this and that triggers me because I want to know the answer.But beside that this is a great movie and you need too watch it in 3D. That's a must!"
"It was pretty similar to the original movie plot. Honestly, almost all sequels are so how much can you hate. I did enjoy how much more focus their was on the kids vs adults though. That was different than I expected. My biggest complaint is the movie could have been wayyyyy shorter. There was so much filler with animals and unnecessary side stories. My biggest enjoyment though was how incredible it all looked. The cinematic experience was incredible. You really feel like you are in a different world throughout the entire movie.My girlfriend had a few good cries as well. Happy, sad and other tears can stream during this one. It is worth a watch In the theaters."
"At the end of the trailer advertising Cameron's Avatar Way of the Water, the director declares the film is now open for business by saying ""let the nitpicking begin"" Now there is a sentence guarantied to rub any critic up the wrong way.Like Cleopatra that over priced blockbuster from the nineteen sixties, the new Avatar film cost so much to make, it has to do tremendously well just to brake even. Unlike Cleopatra which crawled into profit when it was finally sold to TV, this film is well on its way to profit and if Rotten Tomatoes is a guide, two third of reviews have been favorable, Way of the Water is a juggernaut and at three and a quarter hours you ether have to submit to it or be run over.I am not a professional critic and I am not nitpicking. But I declare that this is a rotten terrible film and it deserves to be taken apart and danced upon. It's critical and financial success is particularly painful because there are at least two more films awaiting completion with a fourth promised if all goes well. Which means a lack of story closure to a series of films that already feels dramatically and artistically squeezed dry.I have always thought the most important and long lasting impressions are made the moment we walk down the isle across the foyer, back into the real world. On leaving this picture I was less interested in saving the whales then I was going in.My second thought was that Way of the Water is overwhelmingly dependent upon America's deep rooted guilt over the European expansion, the cycle of destruction rolling over the Indian nations and the obliteration of wildlife and natural landscape for profit and greed. That humans are inherently incapable of stopping the self destruction is explored in another science-fiction film Planet of the Apes as Charlton Heston goes from damming humanity with faint praise to defending it's virtues before finally being confronted with the total sum of all it's endeavors . The ape society that Heston has crash landed into is a mirror image of everything that the counter culture thought was wrong with America. But Heston's chef tormentor Dr. Zaius knows and fears human nature. ""Man has always destroyed everything around him"".Nothing as complex is going on in The Way of the Water. It's not a exploratory allegory. Guilt is simply the fuel that the film runs on. It is tanked up on it. Even whale hunting is thrown into the mix simply to squeeze one last drop into the tin and that isn't the film's only act of desperation. Borrowing heavily, it reruns the tedious plot of its precuser with added whale juice. Cameron has also raided his own past from Aliens to The Abyss and The Titanic so the finished product feels more regurgitated then directed, Recently cinema has been feeding off the past incessantly. We have had three Planet of the apes, three Jurassic Worlds, two Ghostbusters, two Terminators, two Aliens, a shining, a Bladerunner another matrix. Twenty years later do we feel any real nostalgia for any aspect of Avatar as we do for say the Matrix. Perhaps Cameron is aware of this and that is why the film sweats so much to rehash it's self and our happier memories of his better films. There is after all a lot more riding on this film then just money and critical opinion. There is the future.Something else one takes away on leaving the cinema is that Cameron still has an intense love-hate relationship with the military unit. Cameron comes across as an intensely committed film maker. Working with Roger Colman all those years ago and fighting to get the first Terminator made has turned Cameron into a general who is prepared to work as hard as his troops, get it made, get it done but with passion. Along with that drive, Cameron has always had a vision of cinema that is always a little bit ahead of what the industry is capable off. Now he seems determined to pull that industry along with him, single handedly if necessary.Yet something has been lost over the distance of a life. Cameron was clearly fascinated by the Unorthodox family unit of mother, child and terminator, struggling to survive on the edge of society. One of the most convincing parts of The Abyss was the mature relationship of the married divers at the center of the story. Real world observations make the inner workings of fantasies click in a way that bloated budgets can not match. Cameron may care for the environment and for the choral seas but he can no longer relate that to an audience.He is also starting to disappear behind the curve. Take a look at the effects of The War for the Planet of the Apes where computer generated apes are folded seamlessly, using computer editing software, into shots that resemble the photography and camera set ups of a 1970s film (so that the medium hides the artifice). Now compare that to Way of the Water. Detailed and beautiful as it is, its still has the visual philosophy of a 1990s video game.Depressingly there is also a lack of vision. Stuck as we are in little more then a tedious 3 hour teenage drama it is worth remembering Brian Aldis wrote a science fiction book in the sixties called The Hot House, imagining a planet where tiny human beings have a symbiotic relationship with giant plants, living like aphids on a single rose. Becoming displaced they roam though a insect and plant ruled world before realizing their planet is in stasis against the sun, boiled on one side, frozen on the other. Aldis is blazingly imaginative through out. Eventually they travel on a silken thread woven by a giant spider that links a planet to it's moon. What about that for a film Mr Cameron."
"I think James Cameron spent equal amounts of the budget on cgi and paying off movie critics, opting to cut corners on the actual storyline. It was awful, the dialogue was physically painful. Notable lines being ""I'm tied up AGAIN"" and ""hiss"" or Zoe Saldana crying/raspy screaming. Who was this written for? Also he saved the bad guy in the end so I guess 3/4/5 will likely have the same villain. How lucky are we to have probably 9 more hours of blue Stephen Lang leading sociopathic marines through different terrains across Pandora, fighting for different substances worth billions of dollars on earth. Do yourself a favour and just take a really long nap instead of watching this movie. Sincerely, someone James Cameron didn't pay to like this movie."
"I'm a strong Avatar believer, love the first one, been seeing Cameron movies in theaters since I'm 10, so I'm ready for this movie to surprise me more and more. Alos went to see the Avatar 1 remastered in IMAX 3D and boy it is my favorite version, it is truly one of the greatest.Something is odd with Avatar 2 and I'm very sad, but I think the movie can be very different depending on the format you chose. My first viewing was opening day in IMAX 3D HFR and I had a very very difficult experience that took me out of the movie. The film switches between 24fps and 48 fps if I clearly understood. Well it seems some people will be very sensitive to that transition, some won't. I was assaulted by it. Meaning I didn't really perceived the movie as intended the first time, it was totally absurd in the first part for me. Everything felt jerky one second, super smooth the other, as if the movie was accelerating and decelerating in the middle of simple shots. You can imagine I almost left the theater.I have asked around me, on Twitter, everywhere, it seems some people are very sensitive to it, some aren't. I'm one of the super sensitive apparently.The glimpse I had of what's good is when everything becomes smooth and 48fps, especially in the ocean sequences. Please stay on one frame rate next time.It is certainly one of the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. My eyes were weeping without any reason, just by this light shining from the screen, lightened as the reflection of the sun upon water. I didn't see time passing, I didn't realize the 3 hours length, I thought it only started when it ended. People who made this movie are geniuses and Cameron is truly 20 years in advance of everyone else.In general, I think the audience was more children-oriented in the way everything was expressed but the beauty is there and I didn't mind. The most important is that the movie works with kids and still stay an Avatar universe.I don't think that there is any movie like Avatar 2. I think we need to see many more Avatar movies and expect a lot of improvement on the storytelling. This is the launch of bigger arcs and bigger narratives and man, even if I didn't like this or that, please carry on. Can you imagine what will come from these movies ? Space, Pandora forest again, desert, Earth...When I look at the Weeknd clip, I know that the 2D version is great and that's what I will see again because the HFR is not for me. It literally slaps my face when it changes from one rate to the other. I'm sad but anyway, I know that I will see this movie multiple times and enjoy it more and more, once I get used to it.At the end of the day, I want this movie to succeed, I want to revisit, I want to find my format for this film and I don't care if it is silly at times, or not very developed, this is straight in the list of the most beautiful movies ever made. I don't even understand how it was possible. You really had to be Cameron to release something like this. Man, your name is forever engraved in cinema history."
"The truth is, the first movie was just an average movie and overrated for me. I didn't care for the second movie. I was annoyed that a director like James Cameron wanted to make Avatar movies alone. I went to the cinema for this movie though. Because even though it didn't predict me as a scenario and story, I knew that I was going to watch a visually magnificent movie. I don't like watching 3D movies, but this movie should definitely be watched in 3D. They shot very well.Also, of course, the effects, cgi were simply perfect. Acting was very good. I enjoyed the movie. I think it's a better movie than the first movie. The movie is a bit long, but it wouldn't be bad if it was cut a little. A little."
"The setting was shifted from the lush rainforest to the open seas, introducing different cultures and different creatures. However, the story of this sequel was pretty much a rehash of the story of the 2009 film -- about the abuse and destruction of colonization. It was the story of Pocahontas all over again, for which the first one was already roundly criticized before. As they were in the first film, these unsettling scenes were painful and maddening to watch.Furthermore, they added a prolonged, sadistic and harrowing scene of men ganging down on and killing a giant sea creature. The whole scene was dismal and disgusting in its graphic display of methodical cruelty to animals, reminding viewers of all the unnecessary and wasteful hunting of elephants and rhinoceroses that happens to this day. Seeing the nasty head poacher get his deserved (albeit grisly) comeuppance was a satisfying thrill.There is now a rich aspect of family relationships and adolescent psychology involved in the story giving this more dramatic weight. About the struggles experienced by the middle child, the adopted child, the different child, a child who does not know who his father was, a child whose father people despised, a child pressured with too much expectations. It was a familial conflict that would figure in the climactic confrontation.James Cameron's estimated budget of the whole film passed USD350M, and all the spectacular special effects all that money went to can clearly be seen onscreen. This film is practically an animated film already, with all the motion-capture Na'vi characters there instead of the actual actors. Aside from Edie Falco as the General, the only real human characters we see were those nameless soldiers who get killed in the battles.The biggest innovation in this film was the technology for motion capture for underwater scenes, something that has never been done before. Cameron really went all the way in creating a CGI marine biosphere for these Na'vi creatures to interact with water creatures big and small, sacred and mystical. Seeing the callous ways humans invade and destroy such natural beauty and balance sent out a potent pro-environment message."
"This wasn't just a movie, but a spiritual experience and a master artist showing their craft.I'm still in awe of the story and world building created in this breath taking and beautiful world.The visuals are the best thing ever, the dialogue was perfectly timed, and the attention to detail is on an entire different level. This was even better than the first avatar. One complaint I've had about many other world building movies is that we don't get to learn the customs and cultures of the subjects as much as wanted, but this movie took a break at times from the overall plot to show us the way of life the Avatars live."
"Ok I'll state the obvious first, this is the greatest visual experience I've ever had in a theatre. The special effects are next level and the 3D is outstanding.Ok now onto the story. Avatar for some reason has gotten a bit of a bad rap during the last 10+ years since it's release. I get that the story itself wasn't the most original. Well I think this makes up for it. The story, while not being citizen Kane, is pretty good. It's interesting and keeps you engaged until the end. Finally the ending sets up part 3 very well.Make sure you watch it in 3D, You won't be disappointed. Its fantastic."
"Technically, this episode is only good in vision, the script has no heart at all. No touching point like the first one and really don't understand why James has to make the movie length so so so long. It can be much better if it is concentrated into 90 minutes. The last fight is also boring, you can imagine the ending like the first one. There are also great flaws as so many aliens can speak English so fluently. In the last one it is understandable as some were taught. Also why it is so important for the 'Sky People' to revenge on one single person with a whole squad instead of finding way to migrate/invade the planet. In sum, the story telling is a big failure."
"What's worse than watching a boring movie? Knowing there will be at least three more boring movies the franchise will release over the next few years just to appease Cameron's narcissism. It's a story filled with cliched tropes and regurgitated plot lines. You might as well watch it with the sound off. Does the movie really need to be 3-plus hours long? No, it doesn't. Perhaps Disney chose to combine films #2 and #3 and will do the same for films #4 and #5 -- and films #6 and #7 -- because they know nobody wants to watch seven Avatar sequels. (You'll just have to watch four VERY LONG AND BORING sequels. Good grief."
"Avatar: The Way of Water (2022) -
Movie Review ;The master of cinematic grandeur, James Cameron, is back with another banger, Avatar: The Way of Water. Avatar (2009). Took a generation by storm with its never-seen-before visual spectacle in an unseen 3D format, and the box office number sparked to beat the long-standing ""Titanic"" (1997), again a Cameron film. Someone wants to bet against him for a sequel? Think again. You'll have to slap yourself. ""Aliens"" (1986; the prequel was by Ridley Scott, though), ""Terminator 2"" (1991, a groundbreaking sequel to his own groundbreaking classic), and now ""Avatar 2,"" Cameron hits a Hat Trick of fulfilling sequels. The first generation of cinema lovers told us about grandeur in films like ""A Trip To The Moon"" (1902), ""Cabiria"" (1914), ""Napolean"" (1927), ""Metropolis"" (1927), and ""Cleopatra"" (1934), the next generation told us about ""The Ten Commandments"" (1956), ""Ben-Hur"" (1959), the next group was mad about ""Star Wars"" (1977), ""ET: The Extra Terrestrial"" (1982), ""Jurassic Park"" (1991), and then came the generation of ""Titanic"" and ""Avatar,"" of which somehow I was part. Now I'll tell my next generation about the magnificent visual phenomenon of Avatar: The Way of Water.Avatar: The Way of Water takes place a decade after the first film. Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) are living together, but they are a family of six now. They have two sons, one daughter, and one adopted daughter (of Dr. Grace) and continue to fight the sky people to prevent Pandora. Colonel Miles Quaritch's resurrected avatar (Stephen Lang) seeks vengeance on Jake and Neytiri and is willing to go to any length to get it. As the threat becomes more dangerous, Jake decides to leave Pandora and migrate with his family. The Sullys take shelter at the waterland called Metkayina, ruled by Tonowari (Cliff Curtis) and his wife, Ronal (Kate Winslet). Will Jake and his family manage to stop the Sky People by running away like this? Avatar: The Way of Water is all about this epic battle.Somehow, I have always believed that Cameron's high-budget films are not about good stories. Be it Aliens, Terminator, Titanic, or Avatar, they all had sort of decent stories, but yes, the ideas were brilliant. Cameron's extraordinary vision and unseen kind of visualisation always had us drooling. Avatar 2 isn't a great script, just like its predecessor, but I bet you can show me a more visually stunning experience. I know you can't, because there aren't any. The visual hysteria of Avatar (2009) has remained unbeaten for 13 years, only because James Cameron was busy making Avatar 2. I just can't imagine what would have happened if he had succeeded in cracking those groundbreaking non-glasses 3D effects. I wouldn't have left the auditorium then, I guess. The family is expanded here and so are emotions. Avatar 2 employs the same trick that Cameron employed in Avatar, and some of its elements may remind you of the first film. It's like the same treatment again, but in a different world. Avatar had Pandora and too many humans, while The Way of Water has too much water and fewer humans. Believe me, Metkayina is more spectacular than Pandora. You can drop your thousand bucks for the ticket purchase now.It's difficult to judge the performances of avatars, as they are such rare creatures that you don't see often. Something that bothers me while reviewing animated and other artificial films, too. Here, it's sort of a mix, and the actors have really had to put in extra effort to showcase avatars as humans. Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldaa, Stephen Lang, Kate Winslet, Cliff Curtis, Edie Falco, Jemaine Clement, Brendan Cowell, Joel David Moore, CCH Pounder, Giovanni Ribisi, Dileep Rao, and Matt Gerald have put their souls into making the characters look real. But anyway, who watches Avatar films for acting? Who are we kidding?Avatar: The Way of Water's biggest USP is its existence on the big screen. If you can really divide films into a new theme called ""visual masterpieces,"" then Avatar: The Way of Water is that film and the table topper too. I had to pinch myself a couple of times to believe that it was happening for real on the big screen. The visualisation is simply outstanding. Even the word ""outstanding"" doesn't do it justice. It looks impossible that someone can really create such a world and keep you amazed for three hours with so many amazing visuals. How can I name one or two? It's like a house full of surprises, and you just can't help loving every single moment on screen. You know, I have wondered why people make films in 3D when you can't show the 3D effects throughout the film. A genius like Nolan knew it, so he didn't make 3D films. Instead, he went for IMAX and created a visual spectacle. Other directors weren't that smart, but Cameron was living in a whole different world. He knew people couldn't watch two or three hours of film with glasses on because you couldn't offer every single second in 3D format. So, he created an unknown world that can only be viewed in 3D.Avatar: The Way of Water will leave you speechless with its astonishing spectacle. Something that you can't imagine. Only James Cameron can. Dear Jim, what soil are you made of? How do you manage to leave us in awe with your vision every single time? When was the last time this man disappointed us? Talk about visual effects and theatrical experience, and I'd say Avatar 2 is magnificent, fantastic, outstanding, crazy, insane, amazing, miraculous, unbelievable, and what not. Just assume every superlative word that comes to your mind. The way James has mixed those 30 fps and 60 fps frameworks is the greatest example of cinematic majesty. If you understand what it is, then you'll be blown away by it. The cinematography, the background score, the crystal-clear 3D effects, the sound design, the screenplay, and Cameron's extraordinary vision will all force you to stand up and clap for the entire team of Avatar: The Way of Water. Yet another groundbreaking visual phenomenon by master Camron-that's the least I can say. Don't miss the biggest motion picture event of our generation, no matter what the ticket costs. An IMAX 3D or 4DX experience will take you to another world for sure.RATING - 7/10*"
"The movie was made to be cutting edge in effects technology, it succeeded in that. The emotional gasp, however, isn't as strong as the special effects. It is the same story as the first film for the most part. There is something to be said about it echoing some people's cries to respect and cherish nature at all costs. I feel like James Cameron had that as one thing he was trying to get across. He did bring top not h action, some of the best shots I have ever seen on screen. This is the definition of a big screen blockbuster, I am on board for the follow-up movies. Will not be for everyone but good for most."
"James Cameron's over a decade long wait, The Way of Water, shows us time and again how he is able to create a marvel of cinematics. The sequel to the 2009 hit still glimmers with soul and shows a keen understanding of the craft it takes to create a motion picture. The CGI and effects are sublime, a beauty to behold. The musical scores, as well as Zoe Saldaña captivating vocals on a certain track are also truly heartfelt and help add to the magic and ambience that is Pandora.Unfortunately, while this picture has a lot to boast about visually, I found the story to be safe, unoriginal, and lacking. It's a shame, as once you get to the meat of what is happening which is explained early on, you expect there to be more to it as time goes by. But what you see on the surface is what you get. This doesn't mesh well with the one dimensionality of characters, new and old who are brought into the Avatar universe, quickly to be forgotten. Bad guys who are one note, with simplistic motives, with no sense of curiosity or reaction to the world or the events around them. Even if the film is going for sending a message like it's predecessor, I think the characters require more deft handling to really bring them to life and show a bit of confliction when dealing with their inner demons. The black and white storytelling creates an easy plot devise to rally around the bad guys defeat, while unapologetically sympathising with the good guys. It's a laziness that shouldn't be present in a film of Cameron's caliber.In relation to the characters mentioned earlier, I also couldn't say I found there to be any stand out performances from the cast in this movie. While I didn't find anyone's performance lacking, I also wasn't blown away like I had been with the first. Neytiri, played by the masterful Zoe Saldaña showcased a plethora of emotion in the first movie that still resonates to this day. But in The Way of Water, despite her character being given things to work with, and still personally being the strongest in the cast, I was still left wanting more. So you can imagine how I feel about the rest of the cast. But that is no way saying that the acting was subpar, but rather again that the direction and writing didn't give them too much to work with. Despite having a running time of over 3 hours, this film still felt somehow rushed in that I wasn't able to connect with the characters in the same way that I did the first. And this feeling, or lack thereof, comes back to bite in the final act of the film, which left things feeling very anti-climactic and unfinished by the end. At least for me.Overall, this film is a stunning spectacle that I would recommend fans of the first to see. And while I am overall disappointed in the direction this film took as a whole, I am still optimistic about the franchise and what sequels will have to offer in the future."
"RATED 8/10
Language: English
Source: Nil
RECOMMENDEDThe first two things comes in my mind: Positive one, the movie and making takes us to their world and I really lived three hours in their world. Thanks to IMAX and great 3D experience
The negative one: There are lot of moments reiterated from the first part. Lot of scenes looks like first part sequences remade in water world with more technical excellence.I was stunned and had lot of jaw dropping moments in first part. Compared to that one, this one has less. At the same time this is not less in class and mass.The beginning and end has superb action sequences, in between there are more sentiments and taking viewer slowly into the new world from Pandora.See it in Imax with 3d to live their world."
"If you're reading the reviews that the story isn't as strong as other movies, they're just being snobs and probably didn't get enough love from their parents.James Cameron's focus on this movie is to create an immersive experience into Pandora and he did it majestically.I took my entire family to see and everyone was mindblown at the landscapes, fauna, and flora.This movie makes me want to see so many more Avatar movies, nobody wanted the movie to end because we felt like we were part of the world at least for a tiny second.EXTREMELY RECOMMENDED watch on IMAX 3D. It will change your opinion of 3D movies.I want more!"
"I saw Avatar: The Way of Water, starring Sam Worthington-Hacksaw Ridge, Man on a Ledge; Zoe Saldana-the Star Trek movies, Death at a Funeral; Sigourney Weaver-the Ghostbuster movies, The Cabin in the Woods; Stephen Lang-the Don't Breathe movies, Conan the Barbarian_2011 and Kate Winslet-Wonder Wheel, The Holiday.This is a sequel to the 2009 blockbuster-yep, the first Avatar was 13 years ago-that shows you how a sequel should be done. Sam and Zoe now have 4 children-2 boys & 2 girls-and they are living as a family on Pandora. Sigourney and Stephen both return, and yes, they died in the first movie but it is explained how they are here now. Sigourney plays one of Sam's girls-and I know how that sounds but like I said, it is explained. Stephen is still wanting to kill Sam and is tearing up the forests trying to do so. Sam and family go on the run and end up hiding out on some islands with tribes that live their lives based on water. Kate is one of the rulers of the water people and tries to teach Sam, Zoe and their kids how to survive and become members of their water clan. The water people communicate with sea life and use their hair like the forest people did with the flying dragons in the first movie, only with sea creatures. Stephen is still in pursuit and the film ends with a climatic battle. The underwater scenes are great and the actors did a tremendous job.It's rated PG-13 for violence, action, language and partial nudity and has a running time of 3 hours & 12 minutes.If you liked the first one then you should enjoy this installment. I did and would buy it on Blu_Ray."
"There are certain films that shouldn't be reviewed at all and this film is one of those.Since these kinda films are focused more towards the experience rather than anything else.You just cannot contemplate and verbalize what you've experienced, it has to be felt to get to that state, and then you'll get to understand that it just doesn't make any sense to get a review or give a review on this film.One thing I'd to say is: If you like having/gaining good experiences, then this film is for you.One analogy that I can draw to watching this film is it's more like watching the aquarium and if you like watching the fish in the aquarium for hours or even the fish tank in your home, then this film should be on your must-watch list for sure.Overall, it's an experience that has to be felt & not just watched and I believe it must be watched by everyone at least once to gain that experience in a very good theatre, if possible in an IMAX or BIGPIX screen at the least."
"The day has finally arrived. It has been 13 years since the release of Avatar and while I still love that film and was eager for a sequel, for many years I just didn't believe it was happening. Well, those thoughts can now take a back seat. Avatar: The Way of Water is now playing in theatres and this sequel to the biggest film of all time is the better of the two movies, and as I said, I still love the first. Here's why you should check this one out if you liked the first.Set many years after the events of the first film, Avatar: The Way of Water follows Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and the family he has created with Neytiri (Zoe Saldana). Their four kids are just as central to the story of this film as they are. When the ""sky people"" known as humans return for a new reason that I will leave out of this review, Jake and his family flock to a new tribe to request shelter. This is where they meet the Na'vi of the Metkayina Clan of the ocean of Pandora. This group teaches the Sully family how to live, breathe, and thrive underwater. Once the looming threat comes looking for them though, the Metkayina Clan are also caught in the crossfire. I'll hold off on diving in deeper because I don't want to ruin who returns and how it all plays out.Obviously, without question, many people will be going to see this film for the visual feast alone. The visuals in this film put the first film to shame and that film still holds up visually in my opinion. Seeing Avatar: The Way of Water in IMAX 3D was almost too much for my eyes at times. The work here is astonishing to say the least. I will recommend not seeing this film with high frame rate though, which is how I saw it. Most cinema websites will list that as HFR. I truly believe that motion ruins the viewing experience of anything. But yes, this film deserves all the awards when it comes to the visuals, it's simply breathtaking.What I enjoyed most about this film is the fact that there is a lot more world building here and the idea of Eywa was much more interesting here. The character that Sigourney Weaver returns to play, Kiri, has the most fascinating storyline in relation to that. The rest of the Sully family was all enjoyable as well. I really liked Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) because he was an angsty teenager and also just wanted to do the right thing for his family. On top of that, his sequences invoking the ocean and his bond with a whale blew me away. My favourite new character though has to be Spider (Jack Champion). He is the only human hanging out with the Na'vi and his energy made for a very likeable character.In the end, Avatar: The Way of Water is the most beautiful film I've seen in a theatre in years. At over three hours, I didn't mind how the film was paced at all, but my one small complaint is that it treads some of the same story beats of the first film. In many ways, this sequel is just a better version of the first film. James Cameron has proven that he has a bigger story to tell and this film is pretty much the jumping off point. It reintroduces you to all of the characters, introduces new faces, provides some brilliant ideas, and then it all comes to an end. I'm very eager to see where this story goes next. Now playing in theatres, if you liked Avatar back in 2009, I can't recommend Avatar: The Way of Water enough. I loved watching this film so much that I'm just going to give it the highest score I can. It's not my favourite film of all time or anything like that, but it impressed the hell out of me."
"Finally Avatar 2 is out and I honestly enjoyed this movie from go to whoa. Again it is a nice simple story yes and the script has some weak dialogue but they do the story so well it makes up for it.In a 3 hour film not once was I bored or checking my phone. The times when literally nothing is happening in the story I couldn't look away, I'm so engaged in Pandora I could watch their day to day lives every film.People will say it's just visuals but there's great action, good world building and some good new characters too. The visuals are truly breathtaking though! Such a visually beautiful movie especially in 3D. Every time they would go underwater taking that breath in it made me take a breath too every single time.Some people forget that movies have to be entertaining too and not just crazy plots. Avatar 2 is entertaining the whole way through and I really recommend seeing this at the movies especially in 3D...I will watch every Avatar James Cameron makes."
"The movie is magic from beginning to end, the story follows the continuation of the first film and they have done it again, the special effects is unmatched and the story in my opinion is more intriguing than in the first film and I loved the story in the first film, which is to say I absolutely loved it in this movie. If you have a cinema near you showing this in 3D it is an amazing experience and to truly feel the effort and time that went into this sequel you really should watch it in 3D for the optimal experience, I can't wait to see what happens next and I hope it succeeds in the box office."
"This is a visually very pleasing movie. But there's remarkably little substance to it.The main good thing I can say about the movie is that for something that's mostly CGI and motion capture, it's surprisingly realistic looking; it doesn't look cartoonish, which is of course a good thing.Unfortunately there are a few bad things about the movie: First and foremost, nearly the whole thing is a world-building exercise, which does look wonderful, but it gets a bit tiresome after a while. The plot is just a huge contrivance to provide a vehicle for the world-building; there really is no plot, except for the ridiculous, forced one. It does get entertaining and engaging, but still, the audience is rooting for the good guys in a situation which shouldn't exist because at its heart it's a preposterous contrivance.Talking of contrivances, there's the issue of Kiri. Kiri is an unnecessary character whose traits could have been written into Tuk's character. Kiri is yet another contrivance whose only purpose is to shoehorn Sigourney Weaver into the movie. It's also slightly bizarre that she's playing her own daughter - sure motion capture and CGI can give the visuals of an adolescent, but she's still being voiced by a 70-something year old. Odd, to say the least.Another thing I noted about Kiri - there's a touch of the uncanny valley about her which I don't get from any of the other characters. I'm not sure why that is. Maybe she was a late addition or had some late alterations and her face was rushed? Or maybe it's just the nose; Kiri's nose is smaller than the other Na'vi or Avatar characters, making her face more human, which maybe contributes to the uncanny valley feeling because she's not a convincing human, but we don't expect the Na'vi to be human, so there's no jarring effect with them. I don't know, I just know something is quite ""off"" with Kiri's face.I felt that towards the end of the movie, things got a bit clumsy, like the randomly thrown-in rescue of the villain, presumably only to ensure a continued antagonist in the next sequel, and then the overly schmaltzy epilogue which added nothing to the story.The only other criticism which springs to mind is the contracted timeline with significant chunks of time missing, without it being made immediately clear that's what was happening, making it hard to gain any appreciation of the timescales involved.Having said all of that, I did enjoy the movie, I did root for the protagonists, I did dislike the (ridiculous) villain, and even got a bit emotional at the bits I was supposed to get emotional over. It's a fantastic looking movie which I'll be buying on Blu-ray when it's released. I was just disappointed that it wasn't as good as it should have been - after more than a decade, was this really the best script anyone could conceive?"
"James Cameron breaks more cinematic ground, providing moviegoers with a mesmerizing three-hour, 10-minute behemoth of a film that argues for love and compassion, which is exactly what the world needs right now. Dazzling, epic, and yet surprisingly intimate, technical extravaganza! This film is one of the most visually stunning films I have ever seen.Synopsis:
Set more than a decade after the events of the first film, ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" begins to tell the story of the Sully family (Jake, Neytiri, and their kids), the trouble that follows them, the lengths they go to keep each other safe, the battles they fight to stay alive, and the tragedies they endure."
"Long , predictable plot and boring is what I would say this is . Those who are not familiar with Hindu Mythology *spoiler alert * ... The Amrit was not /cannot be derived out of a whale like sea Mammal .... Straight up distortion of Hindu mythology ...little or no research done in that ... The movie is all special effects with a 90s Hindi movie like very very predictable story ...it is only working because the release was delayed by a decade ....too many special effects extremely weak storyline ... Bogus movie ... Shall pass Avatar 3. Come up with something new ... There was nothing new in this movie ...."
"This is something that must be seen on IMAX 3D or a DolbyVision 3D theater. I have never seen anything this epic before at the movies. Breathtaking.The special effects are out of this world (Oscar for sure), the sound and music are too-notch, the cinematography is incredible, and the acting and directing are excellent.I'd describe Rhis movie as a mix between the original movie and Terminator 3, Titanic, Alien and The Abysm. If you liked any of those movies you will be blown away with this one.James Cameron is at the top of his game on this movie, in all aspects of filmmaking. I can't wait to see Avatar 3, 4 and 5."
"Avatar: The Way of Water is a beautiful film with awesome special effects and stunning scenery showcasing more of the Na'vi's homeworld, Pandora. The movie also features some of the most amazing CGI facial expressions I've seen to date. The underwater scenes, which make up the bulk of the film, are nothing short of breathtaking.However, what makes the film fall short as a sequel to Avatar is the narrative structure which feels disjointed. The original Avatar had a fairly basic story but it was well-executed whereas the story in Avatar 2 is punctuated by a constant shift between different characters and subplots. While Avatar 2's story is still engaging on some level, it's not as cohesive as in the original Avatar and if anything, most of the film feels like a setup for future sequels where things will finally wrap up. Regardless, the movie is still worth it for the visual spectacle alone and James Cameron once again cements his status as the King of the Sequels."
"Deviating away from my usual way of reviewing stuff, I would like to split up my assessment into a simple FAQ arrangement, I believe that would answer most of your queries as well as it will give me enough space to stay as discreet as possible.So without further ado, let's get started.Q. How was my overall experience?Ans. Pretty nice, barring the unsophisticated group of people who sat just behind me, it was all satisfactory. Watching it in 3D does add up a lot to the all-around experience.Q. How does it compare against the Original? Is it better or worse?Ans. Many might disagree, but I would still choose the first part over this sequel. Despite this having an abundance of jaw-dropping visuals and some excellent world-building, the first one delivers a better narrative on the whole.Q. Speaking of Story, does the length of almost three and a half hours becomes overbearing?Ans. At times, yes! Especially in the second act where they have taken an excessive amount of time to build up the world around and under the waters and in there the slower editing does take a toll on its momentum. Now If you are well accustomed to prolonged screenwriting, you would have no issue whatsoever sitting through this whole thing, or else, be prepared, now you can't say, you didn't get your warning.Q. Tell me something about the performances and the characters!Ans. Each one of the actors performed to the very best of their abilities, But for me, it was the kids who had stolen the show! Especially Kiri (voiced by Sigourney Weaver); she was amazing.Q. Lastly, do I recommend this feature?Ans. Yes, absolutely, this is a cinematic marvel, one that is supposed to be witnessed on the biggest screen, one that shouldn't be missed."
"Very good movie, so again i do not understand the hate for this movie.It was well worth the wait, the special effects are phenomenal. The characters you get attached too not sure why some say no.Its an amazing movie my only downfall would be the long length of the movie which is well over tree hours long.I cannot wait to see where they go with this with avatar 3 and 4.Trying not to spoil the movie and was great to see how they did bring back some of the dead baddies in the first movie.The way of water did not give us much in the sense of a good trailer, after seeing it i almost skipped this movie but i am glad i did not....Go see it worth every penny."
"Likes:The Acting/Voice Acting
-Not the most award winning, but familiar and just as passionate
-They know how to make cultural expression come to life and sound like a familial tribe that really works
-Worthington is still monotone and stoic, but yet makes it work and keeps the cool soldier/father role works super well for me.-Saldana's ability to sound like an alien tribal cat is impressive, and the raw emotions she rings out are part of the heart ripping moments that will drive a tear
-Weaver has some interesting changes to her voice, able to somewhat mask her voice, but yet adds a familiarity that should give you hints for a twist.-The rest play their parts well and do justice to the Avatar franchise crafting the cultural twist this movie is about.The Pace Mostly
-Uses the three hours quite well to tell a story
-Give you decent amount of information and emersion, but smartly uses time jumps to not get lost.-Handles past and present material very well and manages to keep things easy to follow
-The character stories moving in tandem are again easy to follow and are well-edited to help keep things ingrained.-Moves, but still has the cultural coming of age that works to give you the world building that this series thrives on.-Does well with placement of action, though more is always welcomed, it's placed well to ramp things up and add stakes.The Emotion is Big
-By far made me feel more in my heart than the first one
-Tied to characters and helps elevate the new cast beyond the simple love interests
-Helps establish edge and connection to help care about the characters and their rides and rooting for them to make it through
-Heartbreaking at times, and keeps the established danger that a movie needs to be exciting.-Deeper than the first one and trying to dive further into the minutia that is this series.The Coming Of Age Story At times
-Enjoyed the character development for many of the group, learning more about them and the ties they have to the big picture
-It handles different levels and responsibilities, while giving those quirks to members of the family.-Adds some heat and relationship building that works with the stereotypical interactions that many tribal histories have, alongside learning to establish an interesting dynamic.-Does not magically happen, you see the work and smarter storytelling that does not pull the Hallmark syndrome.-I think is going to be relatable to a lot of people, as the older characters get their own trials to get through, showing attention and care for the series and not just the new generation.The New Cultural Aspect Is Interesting
-Familiar like the first movie, but now moving to a different type of way of life on Pandora
-Not too much of a stretch, a fantastic blend that plays by Pandora's rules, does not break the boundaries, and still is slightly different to work.-Loved the fact that we saw establishments of bonds with nature, the building of family, and touching on cultural qualities without being too in your face.-And works with the story, without getting in the way of the pace for the most part, making for great world building to extend the story.-All while working with the theme of water they promised.The Science
-I'm a sucker for integrating of science to this world and just how amazing they build the world with realistic principles that don't feel too far out there.-The biology and ecology mixing together to make these unique flora and fauna paint a wonderful world to feast your eyes on.The familiarity and anatomy components add that elevated touch, and again makes a platform to once again discover the creativity of the visual department
-The fact it faces modern science vs. Traditional that again plays with the cultures of the two worlds and their approaches to action scenes.The Action To An Extent
-Placed very well, not too much, but also not quickly dropped or skipped out.-They did make sure to give the action it's due time and when the bigger scenes hit, it felt mostly complete and thought out.-The ending fight is big on many levels, and utilizes the world to a great degree that made the first one fun.-Comedic at times to balance out the tones.-A lot more emotional than the first one. Much more justice and character driven punches than the past. One of those emotional stakes moments than straight up combat.The Visuals/Sound Editing
-The best part of this movie, the visuals are gorgeous in how the fiction looks real and moves so well.-Attention to detail in the creatures movement and how lifelike it mirrors the beats they are modeled after, which was incredible to see in how every beast has the lifelike component.-The world is vivid, colorful, but adds so many layers to tell the story, with lighting being a key quality, and yet never gets in the way of seeing the details.-It plays so well with the culture, and the structural architecture is wonderful for how much it pulls the story together.-Sounds add more to the world and don't blow out your eardrums doing it, and I loved that immersion without going deaf.DISLIKES:Over Three Hours Long
-It's long, and at times you might feel it's long if you are seeking more action
-With three more parts coming, why did it need to be that much?-Was there a director's cut coming and if so will it help some of the other limitations?Character Balance Is Not As Level
-The first one did so much with the characters and keeping them integrated, while developing the story.-This film struggles to balance these characters to the same degree and many new people get pushed to the side with favoritism on other characters.-Lots of jumping between the group, with many secondary characters sort of missing that emotional connection to some others meaning weaker relationships.-Planning too much for the other sequels that might transition to more, but in this film is not as deep as I expect.-Zoe Saldana's character is out of it for most of the movie, only really coming back at the end.Predictable for 85%
-Not5 much to go off here, the movie has a lot of foreshadowing that will give off a lot of stuff down the line.-Follows a lot of the formula of the first and that helps further make things easy to guess.Some Very Disturbing/Hard Things to View
-Crosses one of my lines about animals, and even fake still hurts to watch
-The movie crosses dark corners and is going to be a bit tough to see these things come out, especially the depressing moments.-Those with a lot on their mind may be pulled down by these moments and not enjoy the ending's tie up for building to the third movie.-If you can't handle some of the more realistic battle moments, again, this movie is not the one to see.Annoying Character Gimmicks
-How many times do I have to hear, ""I'm good bro?""
-Some of the characters just scream, shrieks, and whining that don't do much
-Others are more about screaming and saying aye yi yi yi, and don't do more than that. It's cultural and tribal fitting in the world, but they don't have other things to balance out.-Other qualities that paint hardened antagonists, but then do little to deliver that punch.Action Is Different
-If you like story based action, this movie works for the emotional component.-However, the fighting flow does not work as well as the first, much more fractured and less integrative of the other contenders
-Takes more of a Rambo approach , which is cool, but again doesn't flow and sort of drags the moment on.-Some abilities are shown than cut short in favor of some drama elements that take away from the action.-A few scenes almost look like fast forward motion when things go heavy.May Have Needed More Time
-The jumps made for some faster story telling elements and we lost details on some elements I would have liked to see.-The character balance could have been solved with more time and we could have gotten a lot more of the integrative nature of the world.-Certain elements would not have felt so rushed, and maybe had more of the organic flow of the first had there again been more time.-Too much in one movie again? I think so.The VERDICT:
James Cameron's latest film is a visual masterpiece and the second bout on Pandora is just as stunning as ever. It's smart world building and storytelling, with great attention to detail on building the world further and honoring the characters that played the first world so well. Action that is placed well dances with drama, integrating many characters to the world and playing that cultural collaboration so well that it's a true science-fiction opera for many to relate to. Though the pace is welcoming to blunt the 3 hour run time, there are times where it seems things got cut, and tried to juggle too much to give the solid character development that the first one did a little better. With more questions answered and news ones arising, this middle movie mostly feels a standalone, but the focus on more movies may have been the thing to limit the movie a bit. Still, it's a film that did its job well and in my opinion worth a trip to the theater, including 3-D showings. My scores are:Action/Adventure: Fantasy: 8.5
Movie Overall: 8.0."
"Throughout the entire film, it didn't feel like I was watching the movie. It felt like as if I'm transported into the world of Pandora. Each shot is filled with rich scenery and amazing details. It's been a long time since I've watched a film that I thoroughly enjoyed.But I won't say that the film is flawless. It lacked a good story and there were many logical loopholes. It's like the whole movie was made just to show the beautiful underwater scenes. The film suffers from poor character development too. While the first part had a meaning, I don't understand what Cameron is trying to convey through this film.But all these flaws are overshadowed by the visuals. If you're someone who watches films for the sake of entertainment, you would surely enjoy this film. But if you're someone who expects more than just entertainment, you will still enjoy it but won't feel fulfilled. Overall, it was worth the hype."
"I found the original Avatar movie to be largely forgettable. An impressive visual spectacle that was worth seeing in a big cinema, but not much substance to it. This sequel was was pretty much cast in the same mold.I went to see it expecting that it would be a movie that I would probably only watch once. But that it was one best appreciated in a cinema with the biggest screen and biggest sound system I could watch it on. With 3d glasses to boot. In that regard it delivered. Just like the first movie it was gorgeous and the world it was set in was wondrously captivating. The stunningly designed alien creatures and landscapes lived up to the original film in every respect.Also like the first movie it had a bland story with cartoon villains. Basically a thinly veiled (and poorly delivered) social message. The villains are 19th century colonialists dressed up as futuristic humans. They go to a far away planet and basically say ""let's destroy this pristine environment, steal the natural resources and kill the native inhabitants - bwahahaha."" Primitive natives fight back against the evil high tech army with help from defectors from the bad guys who have gone native in the vein of Dances with Wolves. The story (both the original movie and this sequel) really doesn't have a whole lot more substance than that.Enjoy it for the visual spectacle but don't go expecting much more than that. If you plan on watching it on a little tv at home then don't bother since you'd be missing most of this movie's good points. It was a movie that was precisely what I expected. No more and no less."
"Avatar: The Way of Water review :Thirteen years after Avatar dazzled us with its technical brilliance, the second part titled The Way of Water continues as a direct sequel with twice the visual splendour and grandeur best experienced on largest 3D screen you can get!!The plot is simple- Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) raises a family with Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) and is living a peaceful life in Pandora forests until humans headed by old foe Col. Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) attack the planet again for colonization. Left with no choice, Jake and his loved ones seek refuge with the Metkayina clan and learn their culture and deep bonding with the sea.James Cameron's vision of creating the Na'vi world is incredible and clap-worthy. The underwater sequences here are breathtakingly beautiful and will leave you spellbound for sure. The near hour climactic fight is another technological advancement for Hollywood and I suspect it will need another Avatar sequel to surpass it.Undoubtedly, The Way of Water is a visual soother. It will make you yearn for more even though the film's runtime exceeds three hours and the basic plot is the conventional ""good aliens vs bad humans"" type. But its ok. And its awesome. Sometimes, great things are inherently simple yet highly effective. Aren't they?!!Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni."
"Boring, predictable, unoriginal. Stunning visuals doesn't cut it. You can spend hundred billion dollars, but if the story is same old rinse and repeat hollywood cookie cutter love / hate, good guys / bad guys, happy ending etc. Bullsht, ain't gonna cut it. Watched at 3x speed and still almost fell asleep. I have lost all hope that hollywood gonna make something original. I guess, it's Idiocracy. We have arrived. They can repeat same story for billion times and dumb masses will gobble it up and say ""wow, that's something new."" Only thing new is visuals. Thats it. 13 years for same old crap. This civilization is doomed. Good job. 400 millions well spent."
"This is to save people like me 3+ hours of their lives. If this writing and acting did not take place in the beautiful Avatar world I would give it 2.5 stars.If you wanted the sequel to build on the story of the first part instead of repeat it with a new coat of paint, you will feel (like me) severely disappointed.It was like they spent everything on special effects and then bought the story on Fiverr. I sat there in disbelief waiting for the time to pass.There is close to no character development, the dialogues are short and uninspired, the values transmitted are surprisingly outdated e.g. What is the role of a father.I really wanted to like it, but cannot recommend seeing it to anyone who needs a decent plot to like a movie."
"Take the movie for what it is, a beautiful story, stunning visuals, and a call for harmony. Just enjoy the ride, it truly is a feet of visual engineering that has never been rivaled. The world building is amazing. The story is not absolutely perfect, the dialogue is rough in spots but the story as a whole makes up for the lack of complex writing. The action sequences are long and complex but they never lost my attention. Definitely one of the best films of the year. I can not wait to see what's next for this series. There are so many options for the future directions of the films. With no doubt, just bye in,"
"I loved this film, the aesthetic, the story, everything!I was just a little let down by the film struggling to juggle its supporting characters and I'm hoping for the next movie to not be a rehash of this one. After number 3 my rating may change. Now to see it in 3D. The wait between this film and the last makes the return to this world all the sweeter. There's some fascinating foreshadowing and developments in this film I hope they unravel during the later films. This film doesn't feel fully complete unlike the last film but we know there is a sequel to this one in the near future so this isn't too much of a criticism."
"""Avatar 2"" is a huge technical achievement and I think that this franchise set new standards in cinema when it comes to CGI and visual effects. Cameron expanded this universe with new sceneries and creatures; he was able to build a brand new world from scratch. I am confident in saying that these movies will hold strong for many, many generations. They used the latest technologies to bring to the audience one of the best visual experiences in the last decades. The different environments, the creatures and the native aliens are just stunning and I do not have anything to remark. I was simply speechless for the whole time. This is a project that involved a lot of resources, but it definitely paid off. This is one of the few films that I was looking forward to watching in the cinema, with a proper sound system. I definitely recommend doing the same, because only in this way you will be able to fully enjoy it. A simple home theater system, for how expensive it could be, it just cannot match the experience.I cannot say that I was particularly impressed by any of the performances, but the general acting level is solid. Unfortunately not all the cast members were up to the task. Spider was pretty annoying and does not add any value to the film. Jack Champion is just really bad in this role. Luckily he is just a side character that has very little screen time. The first and third acts are very similar to the first ""Avatar"" and in my perspective they were very uninspired and predictable. The middle section was the best, and this is where there is the true potential of this movie. The director took the time to develop the lore of this world and its inhabitants. This is my favorite part, as it gives the audience the chance to get familiar with the planet of Pandora. This is definitely a huge recommendation and there is no better way to end this year with this release."
"I'm no James Cameron fan, but he's made some damn good movies in his time, from the visual marvel titanic to the action-packed aliens, I feel avatar: the way of water will ease his way into his greatest of all time list as time goes on, and I liked it much, much more than the original film.Now here's the thing, Avatar: The Way of Water is one of if not the best looking films I've ever seen in my life, along with Interstellar and Blade Runner 2049, I was constantly blown away by the truly marvelous visuals and striking cinematography, it was absolutely perfect.The ending was beautifully poetic and Jake Sulley's character arc is done to near perfection, with wonderful music and hard hitting action scenes.Most of my flaws with this film were with the story and the side characters, the antagonist felt terribly cheesy at points and it had no right being 3 hours long, I thought Matt Reeves overdid it with the Batman but this is even worse.Avatar: The Way of Water is one of the most divisive and polarizing sequels of the 2020's, and it gets an A-"
"Being a fan of Avatar since that was an awesome experience even though the runtime was around 3 hours. I was dying to watch Avatar 2 in theaters and the wait was 13 long years.Avatar 2 can be considered as visually extravagant with amazing scenes which will captivate you mainly the underwater sequences. But the 13 years they took for making this CGI masterpiece, they could have invested that in the plot. The story is wafer-thin, blatant, cringed and cliched. The dialogues were like ""meh"". The crux of the story is like a rehash of avatart. Adding to that, the movie is excessively long which will test your patience even though the scenes are alluring. The action scenes were okayish, there are lot more parts in which the continuity goes to the space. I think James Cameroon invested his major time and hard work into the technicalities and the other side went west. The another major letdown is the background score, which is not elevating a single scene in the movie.Bottomline
A Visual treat overstretched boring movie."
"Well he did it again. James Cameron creates a visual spectacle for the eyes to behold. He continues to set the standard when it comes to next generation effects.It was great to see so many of the same characters again, and just how they've grown... or uh, changed.Plot wise, it's nothing innovative. Sky people mostly want revenge, but also to take a major cog out of the Na'vi resistance by eliminating Jake Sully.The transition to water, and all that entails on Pandora made sense as Cameron's facination with the ocean is well documented. He has loads of filmmaking experience with the ocean whether from documentaries, or of course 'Titanic'.Very curious to see what part of Pandora we get to see next. I just hope it doesn't take another 13 years."
"The film is over rated! James Cameron needs to realise that the movie industry's has changed drastically since the last Avatar film. Avatar 2 is visually ok, nothing spectacular. Story line is awfully weak. All that time and money wasted on visuals, when in fact should have concentrated on building characters and the story...Dune is a much better example of this, where story, world and characters come together perfectly.Without giving too much away, characters were not true to themselves and the action scenes were rubbish.Definitely won't be watching Avatar 3/4, will just wait to stream it on Disney Plus."
"At first I was skeptical with the idea of having a sequel to the famous highest grossing movie (Avatar) .Now I think it was an amazing experience.Ok maybe the story isn't perfect ,it is not the most immersive part of the movie ,The story was quite simple and straightforward ,but the CGI is insanely detailed and real.James Cameron's is magnificent, Underwater shots and sea creatures beautiful, He also once again proves that he's one of few filmmakers to actually understand 3-D and uses it to its fullest.Avatar: The Way of Water is beautifully stunning, emotional experience ,and worth going to see at cinema ."
"Waiting for more than a decade, Avatar The Way of Water hits the theatres and watching this Magnanimous sequel, is sincere to the point of being brash, wide-armed and open-hearted toward the world it loves and vengefully, comically violent toward the people who arrive to destroy that world.Most of the scenes were shot under water and I can understand why it took a decade to helm the sequel. The visuals were stunning, captivating and captured every moment gloriously with Cameron written all over it. James Cameron pulls you down so deep, and sets you so gently adrift, that at times you don't feel like you're watching a movie so much as floating in one. Although the visual effects were something never seen before, there were shortcomings when it came to storytelling.The sequel is just a continuation of surviving in planet Pandora with nothing much to offer storywise regarding Navi's or anything whatsoever, with a bit stretched runtime (which could have used 15-20 mins less). But the super gorgeous, beautifully shot and crafted visuals makes it up for the somewhat weak storyline and the extended runtime is forgotten.To summarise, Avatar: The Way of Water is a clear improvement on its predecessor with regards to its jaw-dropping visuals making this an irresistible return to Pandora, although the story isn't breaking new ground. Let's hope the part 3 will be a total feast in every aspect.My Rating : 8.5/10."
"Let's address the common Bots reviews:""Best CGI ever"": How? To be honest, CGI didn't seem superior to the first one, and that was 13 years ago.""Wow all the animals"": Which ones? There's a whale, a single shark-size predator, rideable flying fishes and that's pretty much it as interesting wild life goes. Huge miss if you ask me, because I really thought they were going to go wild with the ocean fauna, I expected some really huge weird animals there.""The story is very simple"": Are you kidding me? The plot could have been written by a 5yo, lots of it makes no sense at all, and it has more holes than Swiss cheese. For example: did you miss the part in which (no spoilers, keep reading) suddenly EVERYONE but a few main characters disappeared in the middle of a large-scale battle? I mean they even forgot about the whale.All in all, I really find it extremely hard to believe that this movie has an 8.3 rating, something smells fishy in this one (pun intended)."
"*Avatar: The way of water*Runtime: 3 hours 12 minsI have seen so many movies and no one is perfect but I can say this movie is one of the best productions I have seen in years.3D experience is visually stunning and super. CGI animation is seamlessly integrated into breathtaking scale and precisely.The first 2 hours are full of character development. Almost every age of characters were developed. But the Giant whale named Payakan is the most super character in chapter 2.Storytelling is long so you may feel impatient and boring but James cameron keeps distracting you with beautiful scenes. Whether its a pandora, or rain scene or underwater(Which looks like another new world) were mesmerizing.Visual effects are unreal. You can see every detail in depth even action scenes too. Super flow without any blur scenes.Acting is topnotch and they have super chemistry. Score and sound design quality is of cameron's quality.They have seen a different communities which exists in their world with different style of living.This is a stunning masterpiece which one has to watch in IMAX or 3D and that too for 3 hrs+.Filmmaking and Storytelling at its best.Magnificent. One extra heart for the production efforts."
"And speaking of water, don't drink any for 6 hours prior. This part 2 of 5 is OVER THREE HOURS LONG. The line for the bathroom following is gonna be long.Just kidding. Unbelievably, I am recommending this movie. And frankly, I WAS NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS. I only went as a favor to a friend. And there are TERRIBLE things about this, but the good outweighed the bad.(I don't wish to rehash the original, but if you need a recap, seek out that page.) About the same time since the 2009 blockbuster, or 13-years later, Hero-Jake has a family on Planet Pandora. Despite him originating as a villain, he became the Alien Planet Tribal/Warrior leader. Unfortunately, the Sky-People (i.e., Hysterically ""evil"" Earthlings) are back to seek revenge for their defeat in the original movie. Good luck to wherever Jake takes his family for safety.I had a feeling this would be better than the original, but not by much. I hated the original's regurgitated plot and as great as the graphics were, I truly felt the ""Tall Smurfs"" (that I referred to them as) were fake AF. In fact, when I saw the countless trailers for Avatar 2, I thought the Tall Smurfs STILL looked bad. (Same thing happened with 2002's Spider-Man. I saw the trailer for that and the FX looked hilariously bad. When the movie came out, it looked perfect.) Luckily, they DID look better in the finished product, but still cartoonish.I will get the negatives out of the way. The story was meh, but serviceable. The dialogue was some of the WORST I've heard in decades. Like painfully terrible. Think Phantom Menace bad. The Tall-Smurfs still looked fake, but not AS fake in 2009. And I think worst of all: BAD Editing. Scenes just abruptly ended and started mid-action with the next set of characters. It was really jarring.The remaining graphics and attention to detail: SPOT ON. Like magnificent. I saw it in 3D, but on a regular screen. Unfortunately, the entire screen was not used, leaving large vertical black boxes on the left/right of the screen. So that WAS distracting. The 3D still looked good. GREAT? Nope. Plus, there were so many 3D-tropes used. While I expect that from Friday the 13th Part III or Jaws 3D, I don't from James Cameron. But I will say, any scenes at water level: spectacular. Like breathtaking.Another positive: despite its 3+ hour runtime, the time FLEW BY. Only ONE TIME in the entire movie did I feel it drag. I could forgive that for any movie. There was enough action, dialogue and plot devices to make us NEVER feel the 3-hour timeframe. Also, I did like how they explained back many of the original cast, even when they had previously died. And finally, I will give MAJOR kudos to a tremendous, albeit inevitable, climatic final battle. That last third made up for ANY shortcoming this film had. I had so much fun in that final act and it was everything I personally wanted it to be.The movie did feel like maybe 6-8 TV episodes I just binge-watched. I would not have been opposed to a new series or miniseries taking place post 2009's Avatar. If you view it that way, the 3-hour runtime will also flyby.I only saw the original Avatar once and in theatres roughly 2 months after it premiered. I actually didn't want to see that, either. My friend dragged me one week after he had already seen it 2x without me. Unintentionally, I made us late that weekend and the movie was sold out (as it had been for weeks.) So, we tried again the following weekend (of which I still didn't really want to see it) and was successful. I thought it was OKAY at best. I gave it 4/10 stars and honestly felt I was being generous to my friend who really loved this movie. I mostly hated how fake and dumb the Tall Smurfs acted and looked. Plus, the story, stolen from Fern Gully, Pocahontas and Dances with Wolves, was atrocious.No matter. While I'll probably never watch Avatar: The Way of Water again, I do recommend it and not upset I saw it. I HAD vowed off the sequel(s) due to my distain of part 1. Because of part 2's enormous upgrade in quality, I WILL see the remaining movies. You can tell in this one where the franchise is headed (these movies are WILDLY predictable) and I am curious to see it all unfold. Just in case I'm wrong.Really doubt that, though."
"Avatar: The Way of Water was exactly what you'd expect it to be, and that is a film filled with stunning visuals that have to carry a mediocre story for three hours. But I have to admit, the story isn't as mediocre as I originally thought it to be (not saying the story is great, but definitely an improvement from the first Avatar film).James Cameron has somehow managed to recreate his breathtaking visual effects again, but this time better. I absolutely loved the visuals in this film, they're so amazing that they kind make me want to ignore all the flaws and issues I have with this movie and give this film a 10/10. Even if you don't enjoy this movie, you'd have to admit that try do have some pretty groundbreaking visuals, not to mention the last hour of the film is one of the greatest action-packed scenes visually, and it's been a while since I've seen a visual action packed sequence this good.Now with the visual rant out of the way, there is a lot to talk about;The story, while an improvement from the story in the first film, is still pretty simple. In fact, I'd argue that it's not too different from the first Avatar movie. The first film was basically about this human who's mind is transferred into the Avatar, and has to learn how to live among the Na'vi. The film is pretty much copy and pasted to this film, whereas here, Jake and his family of forest Na'vi kids have to learn to adapt to the water Na'vi tribe. And instead of protecting the forest, Hake has to protect his family. See how these two films are similar to one another?Now despite the film's premise not being too original compared to the first film, this film does a good job at fleshing out the new characters given to us. This film mainly focuses on Jake and Neytiri's kids and their struggles of being forced to adapt to this new location. I think the film does a great job at fleshing out these characters and making us care about their problems. My only complaint for the film focusing on all these new characters is that because we there are a lot of new characters in this film, older characters like Jake and Neytiri are forced to step back from the story, and I think I'd be nice to have these two characters fleshed out a bit more.Since we are on the topic of characters, one character that really didn't need to be in this film was Spider. Now it's hard to complain about this kid without getting into spoiler, but to put it simply, his motives make no sense. Spider is a character who is sometimes helping the bad guys, even when he's no longer being forced to be of assistance to them anymore. Spider's probably my least favorite character in this movie and probably shouldn't've even been in this film in the first place.This film is pretty mixed for me, but personally I really enjoyed it despite all its flaws. The visuals were amazing, as expected from James Cameron, a lot of new characters who I felt were fleshed out. And yes, the story is basically no different from the first film, but the film also does a great job at letting the audience explore more of Pandora, and because of that the movie makes me want to see what else Pandora has for us, making me excited for the third movie. Even if you didn't like the first movie, I encourage you to try watching this film and gain your own opinion on it, because I think this film was a big improvement compared to the first Avatar movie."
"You don't even need to like the Avatar world or watch the first one. It's a joy to watch. Sea aspect is great. Underwater shots and sea creatures stunning. Unbelievable CGI, miles ahead of all other movies. This time 3-D works much better , l think first Avatar doesn't even need to be 3-D. Emotion and action well balanced. Almost everyone cried, l don't think this is a movie for kids, they all get bored. At the end of the screening there was a short silence and everyone applause like Jim Cameron was there. Believe me he delivers again. Probably first 3 billion dollars box office movie is coming."
"For all that the original Avatar was hailed as a technological wonder, it was also lacking in many ways. It's characters were mostly uninteresting, it's story was criminally basic, and it had so many conveniences in it's plot, you could almost call them holes. But it still went on to make billions of dollars and become the highest grossing film of all time, a record that hasn't been beaten since it arrived in 2009. So, even 14 years later, with all the time to craft something much, much better, Cameron has rested on his laurels, let the money do the talking, and demonstrated that he's fine with, once again, delivering a film basic in plot, basic in character, emotionally weightless, incredibly good looking movie. There are some thrills to be had, but Cameron delivers a mostly mid-tier sci-fi flick with a very glossy sheen of paint.We're back in Pandora, Jake Sully is fully Na'vi with wife Neytiri and four children, including an adoptee born of Sigourney Weavers character from the previous film. It's been a decade since humanity packed up and left Pandora, but the film doesn't waste much time settling into familiar territory. Humans return to Pandora, with first film villain Quaritch in tow. ""But I thought he died in the first film?"" I hear you ask. Fear not, the film has managed to come up with a plot convenience to bring back the only entertaining character from the first movie to once again be the primary villain. Before long, Quaritch is after Sully, Sully and family flee home for a chain of islands settled by a sea tribe, lots of pretty water and creatures put on a show, and we get yet another bombastic action finale.I won't really bother to try and convince you that the film isn't the cinematic event of the century. If you thought the first film was the best thing ever, you'll likely enjoy this one quite the same. If you weren't taken in by the first, you'll find this as rote and played out as that was. This is a better film though. Far less conveniences and inane plot points are used and it at least makes an attempt at a bigger emotional connection, even if it falls mostly flat due to half hearted, cliched character development. Brave, older brother? Check. Black sheep? Check. Special child like no one else? Check. Youngest and cutest who constantly needs protection? Check. Even the most original addition, a young human boy named Spider, is mostly relegated to a nuisance the writers couldn't quite figure out what to do with. Neytiri is wasted here with little to do but bounce between caricature roles that shine a light mostly on Sully. Oh, and what about this lead? Once again, Sam Worthington demonstrates that there could have been better choices of lead. Where we should see an emotionally charged role in that of a father trying to protect his family, we instead get a range that barely registers as emotional. Even Stephen Lang feels like he has less to chew on, now as a Na'vi that makes him far less entertaining, even if he does have a more interesting part.The film does look beautiful though, possibly some of the best effects I've ever seen put to film. Pandora is even more of a visual splendor under water, with incredibly detail to it's ecosystem. If Cameron didn't spend so much time trying to bewilder and make our eyes pop out of our skull with it, I'd say it's worth the price of admission, but by the time we got to the sixth scene of Na'vi swimming around and gazing in wonder at it, I was starting to find myself over it. A lot of the time that could be spent developing the family dynamic beyond mentions and Sully yelling at his kids, is instead devoted to Cameron's pretty graphics. One moment in particular was devastatingly unemotional and, although I kept expecting something more from our lead, it never came, muting the emotion that should be there. But the film certainly delivers on it's technological promises, something that once again shows in the action packed climax. This, I'd say, is very likely worth the price of admission. If there's one thing it can never be argued, it's that Cameron knows how to do action. He's arguably still one of the best at delivering it on screen and Way of Water shows he's still a master. This is every bit as good as the first film.If I had to put a summary to it, I'd say Way of Water is worth at least seeing once in theater for the spectacle. It feels more like a combination of one of Cameron's sea documentaries slapped together with an in-theater ride, with the film part tacked on. I have no doubt most people will enjoy this, and many will even site it as one of the years best, a monumental achievement of film. For me, it simply wasn't enough. Not enough character development, not enough of a story, not enough originality. Simply not enough of what generally makes a top tier film top tier. I'd quite honestly rather see Cameron return to the franchises that put him on the map than see him continue to undercook this franchise he has so painstakingly put his time into developing the tech for. My only hope is that, since he is adamant about continuing to churn these out, he puts more effort into giving us characters and a story that don't feel redundant and feel like they actually matter."
"I liked the mix of characters more in this one. The larger mix of protagonist characters made for a less predictable list of specific narrative events compared to the first film. There were also just more characters to keep track-of and keep the viewer focused. The overall story events were appropriately what most people should suspect. But the 3D viewing experience kept me entertained and engaged the entire time. I suspect some of the more negative reviews might have come from people who saw it in 2D. I imagine some of the long visual sequences could get a little slower and less engaging without the 3D.The story seemed less unimaginative than the first Avatar. This isn't to say the story is brilliantly written or innovative. But it didn't feel to me almost like a carbon copy storyline of two other colonialism movies like the first Avatar film. And for me that's a big plus.The visual effects were also incredible to likely no one's surprise. They someone seem to exceed expectations even when everyone is expecting them to be brilliant from the start.A couple negative notes which apply more to this film than the first Avatar: A lot of the story early is communicated via voiceover. And in this film there aren't even video logs as an excuse for the blatant exposition within the storytelling. Another complaint is that this film feels more like a setup for more films compared to the first one which feels like it could have worked as a solo film is it somehow was the same, but didn't make enough money to justify any sequels."
"The visual effects are amazing. But Cameron should be better than this.I'm a big fan of Mr Cameron. Not only for his directing skills, but also for his screenwriting skills. But this time he seemed to have missed the goal. I know he rarely does sequels. But is this the best he could do? The story has not changed anything compared to the previous episode. Repeated crises, repeated enemies, repeated conflicts,and wait a minute,WHAT? Even repeated Titanic. Are you serious?As a director, he also did not reach his previous level. For a long time, the pace of the film felt too slow. Yes, the underwater scenes are phenomenal. But this is not the Blue Planet, this is a sci-fi action movie. At least it's what most audiences expect from the film, isn't it?"
"Avatar 2 is simply a banger of a movie. This film runs over three hours first of all. And that is a long time for a film and it takes a lot of attention span to hold an audience for that long. But man, Avatar 2 made that runtime mesmerizing and beautiful to watch. The special effects for this film are insane to me. Everything looks so real, and the amount of money put into it went to really good use. The acting is solid all around, the story is there and feels very emotional. There is a ton of action but it isn't there without its story. Overall even in the slowest part in The Way Of Water, this film still manages to improve on the sequel in every way and I'm excited for what is next for the Avatar franchise."
"A short review from someone who was very stoned during this film- 10/10Yeah this movie is absolutely insane, incredible, mind blowing, flabbergasting, drool inducing and jaw dropping! Pandora is back! I want to live there again with my family and have a sea horse and a space whale that I can talk to and ride.Then when you think about how the film is like 90% CGI and then see what you're seeing on screen I don't know how they did it...so many scenes look like real life. I saw it in IMAX 3D and there is NO OTHER way to experience this film. James Cameron is an absolute mad lad for pulling this off and making it far exceed the first one in every way. Cameron's world and story is completely realized. Everything meticulously thought out and placed on the screen to make you feel a sense of awe and wonder. The forest is beautiful but the ocean....just go see it and you'll know.The plot was very simple but done perfectly. This resonated with me because someday soon I will be a father and have kids of my own and I could complete relate with how Jake felt about protecting everyone.It didn't feel like over 3 hours long and when it ended I was was pretty sad as I walked out into this boring world back to my car and my reality.GO WATCH THIS IN IMAX 3D."
"How do you give your characters new motivation, stakes, and unearned sympathy without even trying? Give em kids of course! The badass woman Neytiri from the last movie becomes...Mom. Her emotions, her motivations, everything about her character revolves around her being someone's mom now... Same with Jake. I guess you can't have an interesting story without throwing some kids in there to manufacture danger and relate to the other parents in the audience. The romance from the first movie? Gone. No time for that. Dead woman from last movie? Give her a kid. Dead villain? Dad now. Very original..."
"I went into this not really looking forward to the exceedingly long runtime and liking, but not loving, the original Avatar. Big Jim has yet again managed to defy the haters and critics by constructing a visual masterpiece unlike much anything ever put to screen. The story is definitely not masterpiece material, but it's solid enough to make this a very worthwhile venture back into the world of Pandora.The underwater scenes in particular are a sight to behold and you really can feel the movie magic that Cameron tries to conjure up. He definitely takes a leisurely stroll through the middle third of this film, but it picks up dramatically in the final act. Cameron crafts some of the most visceral and kinetic action scenes that I've ever seen. Yes, the story is a bit hokey, but you know what, it's pretty earnest and works for the most part. My one big issue would be that it's never really explained why the Marines are so hellbent on devoting all this time and money in getting Jake Sully, other than just blanket revenge.The Way of Water is the success that Cameron and the movie industry needed it to be and I for one will happily jump on the next ship heading out to Pandora."
"James Cameron is an intelligent man. He says if he did not make it in Hollywood he would have gone to university and studied engineering. He has also said several times that Avatar released in 2009 was to showcase the technology and not about the plot. But it took me several years to figure out that Avatar is Pocahontas in space because it is well directed and a visual spectacle.The sequel follows the same trajectory and it is underwhelming. I am not even convinced if it was necessary. Maybe that's why it took 13 years to be released because James himself might have not been sure about a sequel. The visuals are out of this world probably the best yet. I kept reminding myself that it is CGI and not real. James has set the benchmark once again. That's how good the visuals are. But the story is sub par. I was expecting a better story since five writers including James wrote this screenplay including the couple who wrote the recent Planet of the Apes films.Despite the weak plot, I cannot give this movie a 6 as it means below average. I give it a 7 because James did a great job creating Pandora. The fauna and flora seemed like what animals and vegetation would look like on other planets. The spirituality of the Nav'i and their close links to their animals is something Mankind should learn from."
"I have no idea what triggered many of these bad reviews in the comment section but from what I gather its some rambling about capitalism bad, natives and evironment good/humans bad. Which is unfortunate. We're basically talking about the fictional representation of poachers and colonists, so if you feel attacked you should read an actual history book.The movie was probably one of the best of 2022. Still slightly too long for my taste, the middle part of the movie did feel like a stretch sometimes. But I guess that that was the necessary foundation for an incredible finale.It had to do plenty of world building and introduce new characters which were all established well, though I kind of feel that Avatars world building is not detailed enough sometimes, it just builds everything through CGI and then tells 1 or 2 stories and thinks its sufficient. I'm expecting a lot more detail to also challenge the audience. The relationships established are great, you get a really good sense of the family dynamics (which means there is not much room for other characters) and the fighting is top notch. What actually bothered me was how one sided the villain was, I mean towards we see some improvement but I wished he was more multi-faceted tbh. But still all in all great Cinema experience and a step up from the first movie! I'd rate it an 8-8.5 but due to unnecessary review bombings I'm rating it as a 9."
"If anything Avatar 2 is the movie equivalent of clickbait. It is advertised as a ""race to protect their home"". Nope. That is definitely not what this movie was about at all. This movie is nothing more than a personal vendetta about Quaritch trying to kill Sully. Towards the beginning of the film, it is stated that the humans want to control the ""hostiles"" in order for the humans to inhabit Pandora. But the rest of the movie has nothing to do with that at all. The protagonists even flee their home instead of protecting it. And the movie isn't even about protecting their new home either. It's simply about surviving Quaritch's attempt to kill Sully. It's a revenge movie, nothing more.It's just lazy writing. I guess they won't get to the part about ""protecting their home"" until Avatar 3 or 4 or 5 or 6, etc... What a shame too. Because the visuals in this film are absolutely fantastic.This film was basically 3 hours of clickbait."
"I have so many things to point horrible cliches and a story that does not make sense but it would be nothing but waste of my time. Instead i'll just say if you watch this ON MUTE you will miss nothing. There were so many plot holes so many nonsense but i guess it is just for entertainment so i forgive those. But story is just so weak for this to be a masterpiece. Visually it is good but unlike most people say, i don't like this much of rainbowy-design. It's ''Ebru'' art from Turkish history. And it's on everything. Or it is ''Winamp Milkdrop Visualization'' effects on everything. I mean EVERYTHING. It is just, as i mentioned right now, overdone.The orchestral music also is annoying. It never stopped. I have no idea why Holywood love it and it's essential on every friggin movie."
"Camerons visions transformed into video is great. That goes without saying but that aside, this was a 3 hour repeated storyline that occurs in water instead of the forest. Grace finds her way back and where did spider come from? There was absolutely no indication the ahole colonel had a girlfriend let alone a son.We get the hole AWha thing. The planets life forms are all interconnected. Nothing wrong with that. But the human interest has to be a corrupt financial greed morally bankrupt concept? I give credit to Camerons theatrical cinematography but for this specific film is floating a 6 - 7. Just did not hit the mark like the original."
"""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is the long-awaited sequel to 2009's highest grossing film of all time (not adjusted for inflation). Directed and co-written by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana, it once again offers dazzling visual effects, great use of 3D technology, exciting action scenes... and that's about it.Over ten years after the events of the first film, Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) has settled into a peaceful life on Pandora with his Na'vi family, consisting of his wife Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) and their four children. However, Jake's idyllic world is soon thrown into jeopardy after a previous threat returns to finish what was started more than a decade ago. With few other options left to explore, Jake decides to seek help from the nearby reef tribe whose very existence revolves around living as one with the aquatic life. As the danger becomes more apparent, Jake's forest dwelling tribe and their marine counterparts must work together to set aside their personal differences before Pandora as they know it is lost forever.James Cameron's multi-million dollar 2009 film ""Avatar"" is quite possibly one of the most enigmatic pieces of media ever released. How can a film that grossed over $2.8 billion at the global box office leave so little impression on pop culture? After more than ten years since its initial release, there are still several people who cannot even remember a single line from the movie or name just three of its many characters. Nevertheless, the general consensus among all of those who saw it agree that the film was a visual treat and featured some jaw-dropping use of 3D. Whether or not the public wanted a sequel (let alone four of them) is a matter of debate but 13 years, a Disney buyout, and a history-changing pandemic later, we finally have ""Avatar: The Way of Water"", a follow-up that does pretty much exactly what the original did but looking much nicer while doing it.Like the original, the plot is basically ""Dances With Wolves"", ""Pocahontas"", and ""FernGully"" set in outer space with blatant pro-environmental, anti-military messages constantly beating us over the head. Although I am fine with the idea of protecting the Earth and are fully aware that the military is capable of some truly awful things, there are better ways of conveying this to us rather than through the shameless guilt tripping that both the original and this sequel has going for it. Before its release, I was hoping this follow-up would at least try something different from its predecessor since a common criticism was that it was ripping off all of the aforementioned movies. But to my disappointment, the writers (all five of them) seem to have taken these complaints in stride because what we have here is a simply carbon copy of the original, only with flashier visual effects.With all of that said, the visuals are absolutely fantastic and clearly this film's saving grace. Right from the very beginning, James Cameron brings us back to the brightly-coloured world of Pandora we remember with stunning environments that actually look like they've been lived in. The forests still brim with that beautiful iridescent light and the CGI wildlife are all flawlessly integrated into this picturesque ecosystem. However, as the title would suggest, the main setting is in the water, which is where the film impresses the most. There's so much beauty to appreciate in the way the water realistically glistens in the sunlight along with witnessing how all the aquatic creatures inhabit this living space. All of this was apparently done by combining groundbreaking CGI with the real on-set locations filmed off the coast of New Zealand. Practically every individual shot of this movie looks like it cost at least $1 million and it certainly shows. This is definitely a movie that needs to been seen at the cinema in 3D, as I imagine watching in on a tiny screen like a phone wouldn't do it justice. In other words, seeing this film in 3D at the cinema is not an option, it is a requirement.Also, for a film that runs for over 3 hours (192 minutes to be precise), there isn't really all that much in it that could be considered ""boring"", at least not by my standards. There's plenty of fast paced action and dazzling visuals to keep the audience occupied that you can forget about the movie's lengthy runtime for the most part. Even some scenes that are obviously intended as filler for the sake of eye candy move at such a reasonable pace that I found them to be forgivable in the long run. It seems that James Cameron was aware that if he was going to make a movie that clocks in at over 3 hours, he should at least make each moment as entertaining as possible to prevent the audience from losing interest. Of course, none of that really matters if you have a weak bladder so I don't recommend drinking too much water before embarking on a viewing.There's not really a whole lot worth mentioning about the characters since they were all generic and bland to begin with. Most of them haven't changed all that much since the first movie, which is surprising considering more than ten years have passed since then. Jake Sully is still the same as when we last saw him, only this time he has a wife and four children, and that's about it. Sam Worthington plays him to the best of his ability, which is a generic protagonist with a good heart. No matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't feel any emotional connection to the other characters, except for maybe some of the sea life, which resemble real world animals like whales and dolphins. To quote Red Letter Media's Mr. Plinkett; ""The ultimate irony with Avatar is that for all the time and money spent to make this movie in 3D, the story and the characters were still stuck in one dimension.""
Taking into account the sheer scale of its world building and special effects, ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is an astonishing achievement in visual filmmaking. Like its predecessor, it sets out to be an immersive experience for anyone seeking a brief method of escape from the real world, and on that note I believe it succeeds. Sure, it's easy to pick the film apart for its unoriginal story, forgettable characters, and belated release, but that won't change the fact that it still looks amazing with all of these faults in tow. According to James Cameron, there are three more sequels on the horizon, with each due out once every two years. My only hope is that these ones will feel different, because this franchise can only survive on eye candy for so long before audiences become desensitised. Call me old fashioned, but I'll always prefer a great story over great visuals.I rate it 8/10."
"The return to Pandora almost felt like wild life documentary of that very planet. The problem was the lack of a good script. While James Cameron is not the best writer, he at least could present a decent plot for the first part.Here he more emphasized on natrure, lots of characters and... water, his favorite element.But to be honest, the way he presents us his Pandora documentary is just tremendous. I have never ever seen better visual effects in my entire life. This is I think as good as it can get. The characters were absolutely 100% photo realistic. The cinematography is pitch perfect and so is the score.Performance wise it improved a little bit from the first part. I really, really liked Zoe Sladana this time, especially in the second half she performed marvelously. Sure there is still overacting, which was a bothering factor of the first part, but it actually fits her character perfectly. I also like that Sam Worthington took some acting lessons since the first part as his performance had more edge this time and slightly improved. Love the way they brought Sigourney Weaver back and her performance was really great as well. Also Stephan Lang was not as one diemensional as the last time he visited Pandora. I also liked most of the kids. Kate Winslet was sadly underused and there is also part of her storyline that causes some problems with the screenplay, especially at the end. And like her character some come and go without any reason. I guess that will be more concluded in the next installments. Anyway for sure one film to see on the silver screen and a great blockbuster to end the year with. I preferred the first one though."
"This movie made me realize that I don't like water much. Let's face it, water is kinda boring. We spend way too much time in that ocean village watching people swiming and smiling under water. It's slow and we don't feel invested like we were in the forest in the first movie. The truth is it feels unnecessary to redo the whole ""learning the way"" phase. The first movie did it well already and now redoing the same thing somewhere else feels tiresome. I really liked the first act with the guerilla thing then it just falls flat when they start learning about water. I liked the characters and wanted to know more about them; I really hope the sequel will focus way way less on the environment and more on the characters. If they could just leave that lame water village that'd be perfect."
"""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is a must-see in theaters. Do not wait to watch it at home. This film is a masterclass in visual storytelling and world building. The first ""Avatar"" was gorgeous to watch, and it just scratched the surface of Pandora. The sequel dives deeper into the world of the Na'vi and introduces countless new layers of breathtaking visuals, especially as the characters learn ""the way of water"".If there was one weakness to the first film, it was a lack of emotional depth and character construction. James Cameron (writer/director) learned his lesson and spends a large portion of this 3-hour runtime developing new characters, especially Jake and Neytiri's kids. The theme of ""Sullys stick together"" is present throughout the film and adds a surprising layer of relatability.For a movie that is 3+ hours long, it does not feel that way for most of the runtime. However, near the 2 ½ hour mark, I was starting to feel restless and ready for the movie to wrap up. Some of the storylines had confusing finales and interestingly, it felt like there were pieces of plot left on the cutting room floor.The set up for the next two ""Avatar"" installments was evident throughout this movie. I am sure that the payoff will be worth it when ""Avatar 3"" and ""Avatar 4"" come out, but for now, these storylines just seem like loose ends. While the film does a good job of introducing new characters, such as Lo'ak, Kiri and Spider, many of the original characters are sidelined.The big question: Is ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" worth the 13-year wait? My answer: Absolutely. I believe that this film is an improvement on the first ""Avatar"" in nearly every way. It is a better story, has a stronger emotional pull and the visuals continue to improve. James Cameron is brilliant for creating this world, and I will go see this movie in theaters at least one more time, if not more, to soak in Pandora and the way of water.Best Character: Lo'ak (but really Neteyam)
Best Scene: Learning ""the way of water""
Best Quote: ""A father protects, it's what gives him meaning"" - Jake
Best Piece of Score: ""Happiness is Simple""One more note: the word ""bro"" was said probably 30 times throughout the film and got old quickly."
"I seriously can't wait to watch this in 4K. It's absolutely stunning. Yes, there are plot issues. Plotholes, questionable character decisions, conveniences, etc. But you don't come for the plot. It's a recycled story yes, but there's enough originality paired with much improved CGI and gorgeous visuals and rendering, that the plot and its faults don't really matter.Anyone complaining about it being boring and unoriginal shouldn't have watched it in the first place because it's obviously not meant for the majority of them, because if they weren't impressed in the slightest by the first one, there's no way they'd enjoy this one. So why torture yourself and then spread unnecessary and undeserving hate for the sequel?On top of the stunning effects, there were a lot of cool little things about it. I loved how realistic it was when it came to small details like how bullets shot into water behave, and how Na'vi children raised by a natural Na'vi mother and once-human father behave. Lots of neat little details really help keep the audience's interest.Lot of questions were answered, lots are still a mystery. Smart move. Well done James Cameron. I cannot wait for the rest of the sequels."
"Terminator, Aliens, Titanic all were great movies with James Cameron stamp on them. Avatar in 2009 too became one of its kind. But Avatar :The Way of the Water, not sure it really make some difference.There were 5 brains invested in the story department. But one integral part missing in the movie was a story. The special effects were very realistic and outstanding. But seriously, for a layman the effects seen in the 2009 version and this sequel is not really different or great, its all the same. It was same old illumintaed algae, sea.shells, underwater creatures, terrains all the same. To an extend, felt like watching underwater edition of Planet Earth documentary.Ok, now what about a sensible story? The theme is very very weak. The story never justifies all those spectacular special effects. There is nothing to hook you to the plot. Its too shallow. Even a 3 year old can predict what is going to happen. There is a huge disconnect between the story and audience. The movie doesn't converse with audience's mind. Personally did not digest the idea of hunting an ex-marine who has already left the field and living a life minding his own business. There is no strong motivation for a revenge. There was not a single moment in the movie where I could say 'Wow this is awesome'I would say, James Cameron should not end his iife hanging behind this Avatar series. He should realise that Avatar is already achieved what it could've achieved and nothing interesting is going to come out from this Blue Men Group. The more he churn out of the same, people will get bored. He should invest his time and energy for his quest for special effects in meaningful movies. I would love to see more iconic movies from Director James Cameron, and definitely not more of the blue people tragedies."
"This is not the movie Avatar 2 was supposed to be. All in all, it didn't even make sense.Humans left in Avatar, what in the world are they still doing on Pandora?Why bring back the Colonel? That's just stupid. You could have easily made a better, new, more intriguing villain.Avatar 2 should have been: Everyone on Pandora is living in peace since the humans left, and then (obviously) they come back for revenge. Very simple. You don't need to be a rocket scientist to make such a script. In fact, it was obvious since the end of the first film.This movie is just lazy. Very lazy. James Cameron must've been forced into a multiple movie contract, which sounds like a nightmare. Honestly, Avatar should have never had a sequel. Why not Titanic 2? How about Rain Man 2? Screw it, let's make everything free game.I only watched this movie because a friend dragged me to see it, but it is a very disappointing film. I would have much rather had the idea of what I thought it would be opposed to have actually seen it.The first film had high stakes. In fact, they couldn't get any higher.This film ends with everyone fighting on a fishing boat and Colonel escaping. HEY EVERYONE, WE'RE MAKING AVATAR 3!!!It's the same old Marvel excrement. Blow up a big movie to make hundreds of millions of dollars. And keep making sequels until you've kicked the dead horse so much the horse is no longer recognizable.So I ask you James Cameron- when's Titanic 2?"
"The visuals are out of this world - James Cameron has exceeded himself! It is so very beautiful, my eyes just drank in the surroundings. Even during action scenes, I kept thinking how much I just wanted to be there, right in the moment. And if the opportunity presented itself, wander off into safety and exploring. The world feels so real, it envelops you. Also the acting is great and believable, has you invested.One minus to the overall score is the storyline - quite often frustrating and puzzling. But the world building, acting and action scenes more than make up for it - just go and watch it on the big screen in 3d."
"""Avatar 2"" continues with the same merits and problems of its predecessor. We have an incredible art direction, composition of sets that are really out of this world, beautiful photography, the technical aspects are so surprising that the more than three hours of film in many moments is given by the contemplation of scenarios. James Cameron really is an incredible director when working with projects of this magnitude, despite all that, my only criticism would be regarding the 3D, which I found inferior to the 2009 film. On the other hand, Avatar continues with a script of uncertainties, I found the script of continuation superior to the first film, here we have a strong deepening of several characters, which creates a feeling of attachment to them, especially to Jake Sully's children - Who remains a weak character, but is much better than his 2009 version - his wife , Neytiri, is a fantastic character, in addition we have an expansion of the concepts of the world of Avatar, although some of these concepts contradict the first film, such as the reason for human exploration of the alien planet, I liked this expansion and changes, the negative point of the script is the (SPOILER) the return of the same villain as the predecessor and the same hunting story, if it weren't for the great introduction of the people of the water, the film would would fall into a disappointing sameness. ""Avatar 2"" is worth the experience, it's a very beautiful film visually, with good characters and a story, which despite the repetition of ideas, pleases for the addition of new concepts, I think it's a little better than its predecessor. 7.5/10."
"I don't know how I feel about the movie after leaving the theater. Some of the visuals are absolutely amazing but some look like a video game cut scene and it gets distracting. The plot is essentially the same as the first film with no additional story and too many characters to really get attached to anyone. It's too long in my opinion, a lot could have been cut from the middle of the film. It's a 3+ hour film and almost 2 hours of it feels like a documentary and just doesn't have the same entertainment factor the first film had and ultimately being entertained is why I go to the theater. I didn't hate it but I also probably won't watch it again at any point. For me it definitely didn't live up to the hype of the first movie and the long wait for a sequel."
"Let's get one very obvious thing straight right off the bat: the visuals in this movie are unlike anything you have ever seen! Watching this film is like looking into a dream, the boundary-pushing VFX work Weta digital has done here is leagues above any CGI I have ever seen. The sheer detail in every frame is impeccable, heck, when you can see the detailed pigmentation on a CGI character's skin, you know you're looking at something impressive! Even the water is so beautifully realized, it genuinely feels like you're looking at something very realistic! It is very clear Cameron doesn't accept something unless it looks as real as it possibly can! It's very easy to forget that it's all CGI! I would look at the characters and see them as real beings, completely forgetting they are motion capture characters. That's one of my favourite parts of these films; it really is like James Cameron is taking you along for the ride to experience Pandora- you aren't watching a movie... you are there, and I'm not going to lie, there were times where I even forgot I was in a movie theatre! As far as I was concerned, I was on Pandora!Seeing it in IMAX 3D (and really you haven't seen this movie if you didn't see it in 3D), it feels like you're on the ride at Disney, like you are a part of that world! This has to be among the most visually stunning theatrical experiences I've ever had, right up there with seeing the original ""Avatar"" for the first time in IMAX 3D a few months ago (unfortunately I was too young when it was initially released 13 years ago)! James Cameron has revolutionized VFX again, one upping only himself! The 3D is incredible, the motion capture is next level, you can see so much detail in the emotions, and the overall look and feel of the world (especially the underwater effects) are just remarkable. Even the lighting was spectacular. It's an absolute spectacle and filmmaking achievement. On a technical level, this film is mind blowing; it's absolutely staggering. The amount of visual ingenuity that is constantly on display - it's insane. I genuinely have no clue how they pulled it all off... it's just the magic of cinema. The film provides an immersive experience to be found nowhere else, and truly instills a sense of awe and wonder from beginning to end!Now, if I am being honest, when I first came out of the movie, I only liked, but didn't love it. I was almost caught off guard by the sheer amount of story and spectacle I had just witnessed, I was surprised with how different the movie was from what I expected. But over the past few days, I have found myself unable to stop thinking about it. I want to go back to Pandora; I want to experience this movie again! Much like the first film, this one has captured my imagination, it only took a few days to really sink in and hit me! At this point, James Cameron feels closer to a miracle worker than a moviemaker, and ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is yet another wonder that must be seen to be believed. A holy text, an artistic thesis and an environmental plea wrapped in $300M of supreme cinematic spectacle. Nobody is operating on the level of Cameron! The film is a jaw-dropping, astonishing experience that manages to surpass the original in many ways, not just with the technology and visuals, but also in terms of character, themes, and dramatic weight. Personally, I still enjoyed the first one more, but there is no doubt that this long-awaited sequel has one-upped its predecessor in many ways. The main thing that keeps the first one higher in my books is that it tells a complete one off story. In this case, Cameron still tells a complete story, but it also serves as a bit of a reset to tell a larger story across his four film arc. This is like ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" for the ""Avatar"" franchise, and I'm sure this film will only get even better with time as the story further progresses. One of the best things about this movie is that it feels like Cameron is just warming up. He will most likely top this, and that is an extremely exciting idea to think about when considering how good this is!Much like ""The Empire Strikes Back"", this sequel is more of an intimate, emotionally-charged epic. Cameron pivots from end-of-world stakes to drama rooted in character and theme, interrogating the fraught bonds between parents and children, or the limits of protecting family or tribe, while also weaving in a strong environmentalism message. It is one of the most universal and compassionate blockbusters of our time. Cameron's entire heart and soul is all over this thing; his love of the ocean, his experiences as a father and son, his continued plea for universality. ""The Way of Water"" is simply an excellent sequel that while an astonishing achievement visually, dives deeper than bigger. Just like the first one, the story is very simple and we've seen stories like it before. But that seems to be the trick of the ""Avatar"" franchise thus far; you tell a very simple story that is appealing to anyone and everyone, something like, in this movie's case, ""protect those you love"", and then you paint that story on a massive canvas of otherworldly places, creatures, and technology that you have never seen before. But the true trick with both films is that Cameron conveys a valuable message about environmentalism within the films, the first being about protecting our forests, and this one being about protecting our oceans. If any young kids can go experience this movie and experience that message and see why it's important while also being entertained then that's a win for the movie! It's what James Cameron is trying to do; make us fall in love with the natural beauty of Pandora, root for the characters to protect it, and then come out of the movie thinking about how we can protect our own planet. I found the film even plays like a nature documentary at times; albeit with CGI alien creatures. ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is an awe-inspiring blend between a nature documentary and a blockbuster - a thrilling three-hour-long travelogue through the oceans of Pandora with deep feeling in its foundation and an unspeakably epic third act that will leave you breathless and in tears. It's just so rare to watch a blockbuster that's both formally ambitious and full of authentic emotion.The movie is undeniably beautiful and wondrous, I think I have made that clear. But is it perfect? Frankly, no. I didn't see the ""masterpiece"" that many seem to have seen - to me it was very close (and still excellent), but does have its flaws, primarily with the script. You can't fault this movie on a technological level, from that regard it is perfection, but I did think the script needed some work. I have to also clarify that while it is not the best script ever written, it feels like the type of blockbuster script we would've seen in the 80s and 90s - meaning it is easily better than most written today! First off, as many have always said, Cameron's dialogue is not the greatest. It's better than George Lucas' ""Star Wars"" dialogue, but does still have a bit of awkwardness to it. However that didn't take me out of it too much, I honestly didn't notice it until thinking about it after. But really, my main problem with the film is that I didn't think the 3 hours runtime was justified and I felt the length in some places. This is partially due to both the edit and the script, however I feel like the editing was much more polished overall. The editing here blew me away. Yes, the pacing is flawed but overall pretty good, but I also feel that each shot specifically really gets the chance to breathe, letting you really appreciate the spectacle of it all. It's not pretentious as no shot goes on for too long. It isn't snappy or overly-done, just so miraculous and smooth. So to keep the runtime, I would have stretched out the first act and condensed the 2nd, as it felt like at the beginning we were rushed through tons of very important world-building and exposition, skimming through story I would have liked to see in more detail, only to arrive at the 2nd act and take a bit of a pause to the pace of the film. However, I thought the pacing did work really well for one element; the emotion of the film.This film has much bolder emotional swings than the first did, and I love that it really takes the time to explore the characters and relationships on a deeper level. The first was cool and definitely had emotional weight, but I truly felt a much wider range of emotions while watching this one. But, back to the pacing, I did not feel as emotionally engaged in the first half as I did in the second. There was a lot of bold new story and characters introduced by Cameron early on, so it took awhile to feel out the characters and places, as well as the story as a whole. Not to mention the first act presents a lot of information really fast, it felt like a lot to take in and I wish we could've spent more time in that part of the story instead of using montages to summarize our way through it. Within the first 5 minutes it felt like we were bombarded with a lot of new and insane world building information with only a single line of dialogue or one shot devoted to each item, it almost gave me whiplash with how fast it was going. However, once we got to the midpoint of the film I was in. It worked a lot better as well as hit a lot more emotional beats, as well as featuring phenomenal, giant action in the 3rd act! The movie overall is light on action, but once you get to the 3rd act Cameron reminds us how incompetent 95 percent of the large-scale action we get in theatres is these days... because the action here is absolutely thrilling! It even had some ""Titanic"" elements to the finale... James Cameron seems to love flooding ships and watching characters escape! The film as whole is lighter on action than the first, and when we get it the stakes are not as high as in the first movie, but regardless, when we get the action, it hits hard!"
"Be it the never-before-seen attention to detail in the Aliens franchise or the style and oomph brought into the Terminator franchise, James Cameron has never been one to shy away from pushing the envelope in his films. The virtuoso director builds on his immense worldbuilding from ""Avatar (2009)"", showing that the past 13 years have been well worth the wait, narrating a dizzying visual epic of otherworldly proportions.We rejoin Jake Sully (now fully in the body of his Na'vi avatar) on the distant planet of ""Pandora"" where he has to comprehend the everchanging dynamics of his growing family while also coming to terms with new threats from human invaders, hell-bent on exploiting the mineral riches of his adopted homeland. Cameron builds on the story arcs of the characters he so intricately introduced in Avatar 1 and gives us a fair bit of new ones, who add to the rich tapestry of deeply relatable and emotional character journeys that we are invited to be a part of.Avatar 2's visual grandeur cannot be put into words, such is the sheer scale and enormity at which Cameron expands his world-building. The CGI and motion capture work that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has given us seems like child's play when compared to the jaw-dropping sets and stunt sequences that Cameron has dared to conceive in this lodestar of a project that is sure to become the benchmark for all further films in the sci-fi genre. Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana deliver immense motion-capture-enhanced performances with Kate Winslet, Stephen Lang and Britain Dalton essaying solid supporting acts.James Cameron seems to revel in the weight of expectations placed on his shoulders by a generation of fans that grew up watching his exploits in ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991)"" and ""Titanic (1997)"", and delivers on his promise of expanding on the Avatar Universe. With three more sequels planned in the franchise, one cannot even begin to fathom what the 68-year-old era-defining auteur has in store for us in the coming years. Experience ""Avatar: The Way Of Water"" in a theatre near you as soon as you can and if possible in IMAX! We can't recommend it enough!"
"The conversation around James Cameron's Avatar has changed over the years. When that movie came out in 2009, pretty much everyone -- including those who liked it -- said the same thing: ""This is just a showcase of visual effects; its script is a retread of various White Savior plots and the only remarkable thing about it is going to have aged once we reached the next breakthrough in 3D animation, motion capture, and all that junk"". Take that, highest-grossing film of all time!Here's the big question, though: Just how much better have visual effects actually gotten since the early 2010s? If anything, the age of streaming (demanding a continuous output of new site content where quantity must trump quality) and Cinematic Universe ""deadlines"" has all but forced them to get worse.So now, movie-goers are rethinking Avatar in a sort of ""You never know what you had until you lost it"" sort of way. (I've seen something similar with two fully animated pictures from the same era -- namely The Adventures of Tintin and Rango -- where someone noted that 2011 was the year we finally nailed stylized character designs mixed with photorealism and proceeded to not attempt it ever again.) Moreover, they've been absolutely stoked for its sequel, the idea of which was kind of a joke up until recently (particularly the way that Cameron's mindset reduced itself to ""Oh yeah, you don't want a sequel? Well I'm gonna make five! What now, losers?"").There have even been some revisionist takes, mainly seen on Twitter, where people claim that they've always loved the film (same as viewers of Arcane and Cyberpunk: Edgerunners totally never made fun of the computer games on which those shows are based). They never minded that the plot felt rehashed and clichéd; instead, a spectacle whose emphasis is its visuals and imagery is exactly what cinema should be (hence they're also mocking whichever critics make this complaint against the new film). They never thought the climax was overlong and boringly bombastic; instead, the scene where Stephen Lang gets in a mech suit that wields a big knife while stuff goes ""kaboom"" behind him before he gets out of the mech suit and wields a smaller big knife was cool and great, actually. Unobtanium? What an awesome name for a thing!Really, I think people are just starved for anything that puts that much effort into spectacle, world-building, and sci-fi wonder -- and has the money behind it truly deliver.And to be frank, Avatar: The Way of Water is not only a surprisingly welcome return to the fluorescent alien jungles of Pandora, but one that takes what I liked about the original and does it even better (because yes, the technologies have improved since 2009; we just throw together slop like Thor: Love and Thunder, She-Hulk, and *insert any Disney+ Star Wars show that isn't Andor* anyways cuz we got output quotas to meet). We also get to explore the secrets of the seas this time, as we're introduced to the amphibian (?) Metkayina tribe. (By the fourth sequel the franchise may have completed its version of the Seven Gelfling Clans from The Dark Crystal.)I like the characters more here too. Zoe Saldaña and Sigourney Weaver once again act well through the mo-cap (there's a ""twist"" to the latter actress' role that I won't give away here), and Sam Worthington is nowhere near as bland as I remember him. Among the many newcomers is Kate Winslet, who is marvelous as usual (she also had to hold her breath for a record-breaking 7 minutes while free-diving for the shoot, because Cameron's gotta Cameron).Still, there were parts where I lost interest in these characters, factions, and conflicts. I expect to be met by appalled comments (""How can you care about things like whether you care?"") from one side and smug ""Told ya so""-s from the other. Rest assured, I was never actually truly bored; the film is much too beautiful for that.I mentioned before that I've seen critics outright pan The Way of Water in the same terms that some panned the original; they dismiss its tedious ""video-game action"" and complain that there's nothing in-between the pretty sights but generic 80s movie dialogue, info dumps, and sexy Na'vi. Zach Handlen of Time noted that ""Cameron's sensibilities have gotten less adult"" with his latest films, calling Titanic ""grandiose YA"" and arguing that Avatar is a kid's cartoon that goes harder than usual -- so I guess Captain Planet with a Lord of the Rings budget.However, I think there's more to The Way of Water. There's certainly more to it than the first Avatar (which I'm prepared to concede is better than we gave it credit for) while its sense of interplanetary awe remains as strong as ever -- now letting us see more of its luminescent wonderland and follow characters that are, at the very least, pleasant to be with. Speaking of Cameron's career and past breakthroughs, The Way of Water also features call-backs aplenty to everything we've seen from him, from Aliens and the Terminator movies to Titanic and The Abyss (which I maintain is the smartest, scariest, best-looking, most powerful film he's made).That's not ""unoriginal"" the way that the first film peeked at the homework of Costner, Zwick, various Disney directors, Kroyer, et al.; it's a heartfelt look back at the journey that led here, and the innovations that made cinematic feats like this -- where people truly get to feel like they've stepped onto another planet -- possible. I just hope that not as many neckbeards kill themselves over this one. ""The most dangerous thing about Pandora is that you grow to love her too much."""
"The new Avatar movie ""The Way of the Water"" expands the marvellous universe of the ""Blue World"" Pandora. It shows the undiscussable necessity of the ""family"" as the smallest item of a Society. It shows the role of being parents and being kids; some using the World as a playground, some talking with the ""inner truth"" some revolting growing-ups.Avatar 2 carries our minds off to the turquoise and blue CGI oceans of fantasy and creativity. It could give our minds a rest... but if you don't stop thinking you'll find out that Pandora is not light-years away from Earth - and it's not fiction.If you watch history you'll find out what ""mighty rulers"" did to indigenous peoples. On some continents you'll discover that till today.If you take a look at the present time you'll find out how mankind makes Nature suffering, how mankind destroys the wonders of the oceans, that brutal gruesome whale hunting is still allowed for some countries. And you'll find out that technology is not all and not the way to give peace to your soul.""Avatar 2 The Way of the Water"" is an impressive spiritually movie with a lot of slamming criticisms against the behaviour and bloody ignorance of human beings who had not learned from their mistakes in the Past.It's not just a movie. Disney responded to this philosophical meaning with the project ""Keep Our Oceans Amazing"".The best for all of us in a healthy environment!"
"The original Avatar is far from a good movie. It's plot and characters are incredibly basic and predictable yet people loved it for its visuals, action and soundtrack. It was the highest bar for VFX. Now in our age of CGI action movies, with stronger plots, does the sequel push the boundary for VFX and CG. The answer is a resounding yes. It's the new gold standard.Avatar: The Way of Water is the best looking film I've ever seen. The CG is flawless, the colours and imagery is so vibrant and imaginative and the soundtrack is wonderful. The cinematography is fantastic and really immerses you into the world of Pandora to a level unmatched by any film. But visuals aren't everything, what about the plot and characters.They're surprisingly alright. While the plot is simple, it contains little of the preachy messaging of the original, although it does contain some notable examples of it in the early minutes. This film is more concerned with expanding the world and the characters. Jake feels more fleshed out here, now having to be a father and Sam Worthington gives a stronger performance than the original. All the new characters are captivating too, all excellently performed and animated, especially Kiri, played by the excellent Sigourney Weaver. Colonel Quaritch, the one note antagonist of the previous film, is overall more threatening and emotive than the original and there is clearly potential to flesh him out further in the third entry.The only issues with this film is that sometimes the dialogue and messaging can be as subtle as a brick and there are some instances of Cameron cheaply manipulating the audience into hating the villains. The pacing could've also been smoother as the intro to this movie rushes through a lot of details and I feel that there must be a director's cut of the film that we're missing. However, this film's third act more than makes up for most shortcomings as it is awesome. Visually stunning with great action choreography and stronger investment in the characters. Cameron still shows he can do action better than the rest.Overall, The Way of Water is miles better than it's predecessor and prices CGI isn't an ugly concept that marvel has made everyone despise. With talent and time it can be used to enhance a film tenfold. While it's far from perfect, this sequel actually made me excited for Cameron's later planned films. It's a visual masterpiece that must be seen to be believed."
"Oh my goodness. If you liked the first one, you'll love the second. In the trailer, Jake says, ""This family is our fortress,"" and that is the main theme of the story, which is what makes it so great. What great characters - the dad and mom yearning to protect their family, the older brother with the burden of being responsible for his younger siblings, the younger son wanting to prove himself, the adopted daughter wanting to fit in. Of course it has the environmental aspect, but that takes a backseat to the importance of sticking together and being there for your family, no matter what. On top of it all, the cinematography is outstanding and beautiful. The creatures are imaginative. If you see it, see it in IMAX."
I wasn't sure about the film in the first hour. The story didn't immediately grip me but by the second hour i was falling in love with this family and the underwater world of Pandora.Cameron has lost none of his directing chops. If anything this features some of his best work. While there's nothing particularly new in the storytelling it's all done so well and shows he's still one of the best directors working today.The performances all round were excellent. I loved the connection with the whale and how that paid off throughout the story. You can see all the deeper themes woven into the film by Cameron.Brilliant.
"For the second time (the first being the first Avatar movie), James Cameron seems committed to proving that he can take any story, however basic it might be, and turn it into an engaging and exciting movie through pure mastery of the art of filmmaking.Avatar The Way of Water expands on the world and ecology message of the first Avatar movie and adds a number of new, young characters that inject new energy into the story. It is particularly appreciated that these young characters are likable unlike so many of the spoiled youth depicted in movies and shows today. In the end, however, the story of the movie is not particularly interesting, let alone original. But James Cameron's mastery of filming, editing, sound and of every other aspect of filmmaking makes the movie a total blast to watch, even if one doesn't ever really know why. Such belief in the power of the moving image to move audiences is refreshing at a time when the movie experience is constantly being degraded and the theatre experience at risk.From a story standpoint, beyond the character introductions and some small details, it all feels very similar to the first Avatar. The main difference is maybe that the bad guys this time around have adopted the form of the Na'vi. Beyond making hand to hand combat scenes more balanced, this change turns the core conflict in the movie from an ethnic and cultural conflict into what appears -at least visually- as a pure power struggle. One can imagine possible echoes with the evolution of the North American society movements in the last ten years."
"I have long awaited the sequel to Avatar and this film did not disappoint. The three hours went by quickly, with some excellent scenes that evoke emotions and thoughts. The cinematography was good, even though the film was mostly CGI. The CGI in some scenes of the film was brilliant. There were significant themes in the film such as family and what it feels like to be an outsider. Animal rights also featured strongly in the film.Cinematically, the first part of the story felt a bit flat. The plot was presented quickly, but the emotional bond with the characters was not really established. The animals felt a bit wimpy (except the ""big whales"" were nice) and when Lo'ak first encountered the ""sea monster"" there was no excitement because the sea monster felt wimpish. The story was very predictable and no twists came at any point in the story.One may wonder how after such criticism I can give a 9/10 rating. As I said at the beginning, three hours went by quickly. My visual eye enjoyed and I experienced emotions and insights during the film. Besides, I have given worse films than this one an 8/10 rating this year."
"The Way of Water. The Way of Life. The Way of Living. How can we live the way of life that we were meant to live. We were created for a purpose. A purpose that far reaches the expanse of the universe. But how can we live this way and be accepted - I can tell you: Living life in abundance. In the Gospel of John, our Lord and Savior taught us: ""A thief has only one thing in mind - he wants to steal, slaughter, and destroy. But I have come to give you everything in abundance, more than you expect - life in its fullness until you overflow."" (John 10:10, The Passion Translation)
Not your typical way of starting a movie review, isn't it? I want to go back to 13 years ago to 2009. We met a young, but naïve soldier and all he wanted was to live up to his brother's expectation of becoming more. Well, he became more when he befriended an indigenous people called the Na'vi. Humans and the Na'vi were meant to co-exist, until the rest of humanity couldn't accept them for who they were - people.Fast forward to 2022, now the Na'vi have a choice to make: to stay or to move? How can you make such an important decision within the blink of an eye. We are meant to transition. We are meant to make the decision to move or not to move. That's just who we are, but the Na'vi, they only have one way of life - theirs and they can't accept the fact that life is more than the forest of Pandora.I'm not going to sit here and spoil the movie for you all - but I will say this: James Cameron is a genius when it comes to the cinematic world. He creates things and his visions give life a meaningful balance between the choice of right living and the wrong way of living. He can take anything from Alien to the Titanic and now Pandora.Leading an all-star cast, Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana give the performances of their lives. The characters, the CGI, the sound effects - exquisite and just remarkable. Nothing is too big for James Cameron to do - and in the end: NOTHING IS TOO BIG FOR OUR GOD! HE CREATED US TO LIVE IN ABUNDNACE IN HIS WAY OF LIVING WATER!"
"Another preachy bs story from the billionaires of the world how we should all eat bugs to save the planet while Greta and her uncle Karl Schwab will fly their private jets to Geneva on ski vacation.Recycled story from the first one (that itself was just Pocahontas in space with Smurfs), too long and overindulgent, with fake looking CGI. Seriously, every positive thing coming about this film is from people praising the visuals...is it just boomers talking, and they never seen a video game cutscene? Not even a good one when whole concept art is so childish, simple and fake looking. You can never make something so ridiculous believable and ""real"" (what would that even mean?) so why waste money? Except to satisfy James Cameron's inflated ego.If you like looking at a screensaver you will love this thing, otherwise a waste of money and time."
"As most people are aware, the lead up to the sequel to the original avatar was fuelled by pessimistic dialog from anyone with a podcast or YouTube channel and a moderate following. However, I am happy to report that this movie has exceeded all expectations and allowed me to relive the original experience of my younger self.Its visuals alone are enough to send any casual viewer into a trance, allowing you to be spoon fed the entire time by James Cameron and his wildest imagination. The underwater visuals are simply astounding and I have no doubts your eyeballs will be working overtime to keep up. While the colour blue does seem to be the entire theme of the movie it's more than fitting for a film that is at least 60% underwater.The plot itself is not the most immersive part of the movie but I assure you it's made up for by the entire experience. To summarise, James Cameron has done an amazing job, I'm glad to have lived to a time where amazing sci fi concepts can be brought to life and given the justice they deserve.9/10 would recommend."
"In 2009, I watched Avatar, the $2 billion movie that used the papyrus font as its logo, in IMAX 3D. It was a wild experience as I have never seen such amazing CGI in a film. James Cameron, the director, then announced he was making 3-4 sequels to Avatar which was kind of baffling. 13 years later, we finally get a sequel. Was the sequel worth the wait?Firstly, the visuals of this movie are somehow even more amazing than the first film. The forest of Pandora looks more stunning than it did 13 years ago; the advance in technology is very evident. The scenes in the water look gorgeous and so real that it's hard to believe it is CGI at times. One thing with the first movie was that it felt like live-action people were in a green screen room. Avatar: The Way of Water is mostly CGI with live-action blended in. We see live-action characters move in the same scene as CGI characters and interact with one another like living beings. It didn't give that green-screen feeling, which was awesome. I also love the world-building and design of the world. There are water-based Navi clans with looks and customs that are different from the forest Navi. You can see it in their skin colour and the design of their hands and tails. The sea creatures also have great designs with their own rules and how they operate. It was clear a lot of thought was put into everything.The original 2 main characters, Jake and Neytiri, return from the 1st film but they are not the main focus this time. The main characters are their kids with Sigourney Weaver returning but playing as one of those kid characters instead. I was a little worried as kid characters tend to be annoying but I think the writer did a good job of making the kids not completely annoying. Sigourney is surprisingly convincing as a young kid and I was interested to see more of her character in the future. I think James succeeds in making us care more about these new characters than he did in Avatar 1. Jake, despite not being at the forefront this time, has his character arc. He is no longer the fearless leader he was in the 1st film as he now has 4 kids to take care of. His priority is different and he struggles with that. Stephen Lang also returns as the antagonist, Colonel Miles, again despite dying in the 1st film. He was very one-dimensional in the 1st Avatar but here they do try to give him some more depth which I appreciate.However, Neytiri is unfortunately very sideline in this sequel. She is barely relevant until the end of the movie and even then, she doesn't have any character arc. If anything, I feel like her character somehow feels worse here. One thing I struggled with in the 1st film was remembering names including that of the main characters. Unfortunately, I still have this issue in The Way of Water. This is thanks to the fact that a character's name only ever seems to be mentioned once and never again which makes it difficult to remember anyone. For example, Kate Winslet of Titanic fame is in this movie but I wouldn't be able to tell you what her character's name was for the life of me.In terms of the story, it's very simple and by the book. It is about the kids learning the customs of a clan and struggling to fit in which sounds awfully similar to the 1st film or a high school drama. The plot works fine but it is very bland and predictable. Every cliché and trope you see from a coming-of-age story is here. The movie is also really long with a run time of 192 minutes. I'm not sure the plot justified that run time as there were many moments where a lot doesn't happen and could've been cut to reduce the runtime. James Horner, the original composer of Avatar, passed away and was thus replaced by Simon Franglen. Simon does a serviceable job but the music score is just not very memorable compared to Jame's music score. The best soundtrack in The Way of Water is the ones that were reused.Overall, Avatar: The Way of Water is a proper cinematic experience. Yes, the movie's plot and characters aren't that memorable but the visuals are truly amazing. In an era where it feels like we get a lot of poorly made CGI, it is a breath of fresh air to have a movie that has beautiful-looking CGI for what feels like the entire movie! Watching in it cinema with IMAX 3D was a terrific experience and it is the best way to watch Avatar: The Way of Water. I'm thoroughly looking forward to the sequels!"
"'Avatar: The Way of Water' (or Avatar 2) comes almost exactly 13 years after the original broke all box-office records. The film does well to simultaneously make it feel like you've never left Pandora, but also to remind you of the characters and catch you up on the new ones, including Jake Sully (Worthington) and Neytiri (Saldana)'s four kids - eldest son Neteyam (Flatters), Loak (Dalton), Kiri (Weaver) & little Tuk (Bliss). The explanation for Kiri being Grace (Weaver's original character)'s daughter is not clear at all, but Colonel Quaritch (Lang) is back, with a far simpler explanation - he and his marine team were cloned on Earth and sent back in Navi Avatars.Once we re-establish that humans are the worst and still trying to colonise Pandora and exploit it's resources, Sully & Neytiri take their family away from the fighting to the coral atolls/islands of the Metkayina tribe, led by Tonowari (Curtis) & Ronal (Winslet). This creates some interesting dynamics, but also introduces a whole new underwater ecosystem for the camera to explore. Probably the most impressive thing about these films is how Cameron makes everything seem so real and all the creatures plausible - all seeming like slightly different evolutionary branches of Earth's creatures. The 'whales' are particularly remarkable.It's good to see a little comedy thrown in (& Aussies/Kiwis), with Jermaine Clement & Brendan Cowell. However, just when the film seems like it might be a repeat of the first, the second act turns it on it's head and focus on the inter- and intra-family dynamics and has a narrower focus on how the ocean-dwelling Navi interact with their environment. This serves the film well, as rather than try to fight every human colonist and machine, it is more intimate and you get to care for the main characters by the end. Bring on the next 3!"
"..............Colonel Miles Quaritch is a Na'vi. Learning about his mistakes in the previous movie. All he wants is revenge against Jake Sully. Jake has kids with Neytiri, this sequel focuses more on them. I must say that this movie is truly a work of art. The visuals are stunning and spectacular. Photorealistic cinematography is beautiful. The family moves on to a village and we see more of Pandora. His sons and daughters learned about the ways of the water. We see one of his sons build a relationship with a Whale. The scene alone reminds me of How To Train Your Dragon 2. Miles Quaritch is always fortunate that Sully's kids are always there when he needs leverage. Does this movie give Quaritch the revenge he needs? Watch the movie and find out. I recommend it."
"There is no other film in the history of cinema that awaited so long for the sequel. The film's release was delayed for various reasons, but people don't lose attention to it. I'm talking about the biggie and you knew it already. There is no need for an introduction to the veteran filmmaker James Cameron. We were stunned by his early works like Titanic, and Terminator, and when he came with the first part of Avatar, we were just out of control because of the visual images and the new way of visual representation. We wondered about Pandora and the blue people. After 13 years when the sequel comes up with a bang, we just feel the same kind of thing likewise the first part. Cameron once again produced something out-of-the-box visual magic with the assistance of new technology. In the first part, we saw the magic of the forest and now it's about the like sorcery blended in the sea (water). Avatar - The way of water primarily focused on the character detailing rather than the first part something came out of freshness because we all need an introduction to Pandora and its inhabitants. When it comes to the sequel we already knew about it and that's why Cameron specifically focused on the character arc. The movie clearly shows the detailed aspects of the characters Jake Sully, his wife Neytiri, their children Neteyam, Tuk, Lo'ak, and also Kiri, Ronal, Tonowari even the villain Quaritch too. The story is not at all a fresh one but the way of execution is unbelievable. Migration was the basic element of the first part but here it is expatriation. Jake Sully and his family become refugees because of the coming back of the sky people. So they are forced to move to the other part of Pandora. The people residing in that part were sea people. They live and develop their life according to the sea. They gave shelter to Sully and his family and trained them to communion with the sea. Then James Cameron invites us into the beauty and mystery of the sea and that was a splendid visual treatment. In the end, all are united to fight against the sky people. I'm not going to spoil much more. Kate Winslet bags a record beating Tom Cruise by holding her breath underwater for continuous 7:14 minutes. Tom did it for Mission Impossible and Kate's record-breaking was viral news. Cameron setups new types of equipment for the underwater shoot. As we said early the visuals are splendidly more in 3D which illuminates people to expect the next 3 parts. But there is nothing hooking at the end portion of the film about the upcoming parts. I expect a scene after the end credits (it is usual). But aside from when I rethink that kind of a hook, I feel that there is no need for such a thing for the audience to wait for the next parts."
"When I checked the runtime of the movie, it felt really long. But to be honest it didnt feel like a 3 hours film. Story was predictable. But the world of pandora seemed to be more beautiful and elegant than in Avatar 1. This one is surely a masterpiece and must be watched in theaters for the immersive experience. Cameroon is really a visionary. Pandora in his vision is truly iconic. Climax portion was awesome. CGI and motion capture is epic. The ending leaves door for next chapter. I thought of watching it after OTT release,but now feels great for not missing the theater experience. Fully satisfied. I am giving 10/10."
"The first Avatar film is one of my all time favourite movies - yes I know it's the same story we have seen several times, but I couldn't care. I saw it at 15 years old, and was captivated by the stunning world. Now, 13 years later, we finally have the sequel and it is remarkable. Is it a perfect movie? No, it has issues, which I will get into, but dam the good outweighs the bad.The visual effects in this movie.... holey Jesus. For the first half, the effects looked good, not mind blowing, but they were very good, then we got to the water scenes. You thought Aquaman looked good? That has nothing on this. You have never seen a more visually stunning movie than Avatar 2... you haven't, full stop. The effects were so good, that I completely forgot I was watching fully CGI characters. They fit perfectly into this realised world. Even when standing next to human characters, the aliens look flawless. The detail, the emotions they show on screen, just perfect.The story is also fantastic, and those who complained that the first was too similar to Dances with Wolves, will be pleased that this isn't a copy of another movie. This film has a very strong family message, especially the role of a father. Too many films, and TV shows now, show fathers as weak morons... not this movie. Jake is a strong father, who will do anything to protect family 'A father protects, It's what gives him meaning' Is a brilliant line from the movie, and as someone who has children, it hit close to home.I do have some complaints. Too many characters. Avatar 2 shoves dozens of characters in our faces within just the first 30 minutes. It gets jarring, especially when these charcaters are new and have weird names. I struggled to remember any of the new characters, apart from a couple. If they had removed some of them, and revealed the rest until the next movies, the film would have benefitted from it. I also felt like the way they brought back Quaritch was a bit off. It felt shoe-horned in there, despite him being a good villian. My final complaint would be the music. Avatar 1 had one of the best soundtracks to come out of the 2000s. It was fantastic. But with the great James Horner no longer with his, his replacement doesn't live up to his skills. I don't think the music in this film is bad, it just didn't gripe me like the first movie did.All in all, Avatar 2 is a fantastic movie. Despite being over 3 hours long, it didn't feel like it. It was emotional, very well acted, directed, shot, visually stunning and has a brilliant message about family, and what it means to be a father.Can't wait for the next one.9.2/10."
"Avatar sequel recipe: throw Avatar and Titanic into blender, add general helping of corny cliches plus plenty of water, result is three hours of stunning visuals continuously interrupted by toe-cringing dialogue and plot.Typical Hollywood, while there is no limit to expense when it comes to 3D special effects, very little is spent on actually preparing an interesting storyline - which here is completely one dimensional - or spent on creating characters with depth - which in this case all are completely 2D. As a matter of fact, I recall just one surprising behaviour in the whole film. The overall experience is a strangely building numbness to special effects accompanied by a sense of boredom with plot and increasing exasperation with dialogue."
"What's up with the obession with war? Why the constant undercurrent of threats when you have a whole planet to explore? Why not focus on the Pandora tribes and THEIR lives instead of flying in the angry-people-military? This happens on earth. Keep it away from the rest of the cosmos ;)But I'm serious. Why was this - obviously - gifted team of creators and their beautiful dream of a planet wasted on an outdated story like this? (And I know war is still a relevant topic but perhaps that's because we can't stop dreaming it into existence).We went to see Avatar 2 in a beautiful movie theater and looked forward to it. Never watched the trailer to be honest. And we couldn't make it through the whole thing. Us and several other people left after 1,5 hours.Just a couple of minutes into Avatar: The Way of Water it becomes clear that it's the same old story set in an otherworldly Bali experience.Avatar 2 brings us one cliche after another. The dialogues and the storyline are cringe. The facial expressions - except for that of Neytiri - are unattractive to me and the voice of Kiri sounds way too old for her age. I guess I'm not the target audience.So, after this vinegar pissing - as we say in The Netherlands - I can only agree that the visuals are stunning, they really are. It's absolutely breathtaking to watch the explorations of the ocean side and I wished that the makes would have focused on their beautiful vision a bit more.Perhaps it's time to tell different stories. And although our world leaders would disagree (obviously) I'm done with war."
"Finally after well over a decade later, the long awaited Avatar sequel is here! So much hype, anticipation and build up surrounds this film........can it live up to expectations or will it be the biggest flop of all time?I'll be honest, I don't really remember the first film back in 2009 at all really. I do remember going to see it and thinking it was good. Being blown away by the incredible visuals however not really buying into the characters or story that much. Sadly for me ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is more of the same!James Cameron has once again created a visual feast for the eyes, from start to finish this film is sublime to look at! The technology that Cameron has been pushing for years has 100% payed off in a truly awe inspiring way. I can't think of another film that pushes the boundaries with technology than this film does. Huge credit to the team behind the film for making this possible!The only other positive that I enjoyed about the film was the world building and the expansion of the story. It was fascinating to explore the world more and see new incredible things bought to life.However for me thats where the positives end, the rest of the film is just meh to fine. Not for everyone but for me some of the most important aspects to a film are characters and story. If you have a great story, complex and interesting characters, that is a great foundation to build a film around! Sadly for me this film relies far far to much on the special effects as the wow factor whilst leaving the story and characters behind in quality. For me its just not that interesting, I'm not saying its terrible because its not. However I was hoping an expecting a bit more considering how long Cameron has had to make this film. It feels a very safe and simple story to tell and doesn't take too many risks.Of course I understand that this is the first of 4 million sequels that Cameron is planning for this franchise lol!70% out of 100, its a good film. Top tier visuals from start to finish and something that is game changing! No other film has effects this well crafted! However the more important parts to the film ie; the story and characters are very underwhelming. I wouldn't say this is any better or worse than the first film all those years ago.Just like ""Avatar"" from 2009, ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" will be pretty forgettable!"
"Okay, I actually enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would, I didn't think it could live up to the hype of 13 years waiting for a sequel but it did, and it didn't!I want to start with the positives in the movie for me as they outweigh the bad. The visuals were absolutely stunning !! The score was also really good, having samples from the first movie also was a nice touch. The acting was all top notch and the action was good. How the movie leaned on family and it's importance I believe was the main motivation of the movie.The movie also got us to really care for the animals on Pandora once more, connecting them to us. I did really enjoy it.A key takeaway is the amazing visuals I have to speak on again, the movie makes you want to be there, to feel it to experience it, to be one with it, I think with the third movie being at a faster pace and more action, this could be one of the best set up movies out there !!!Now the downsides, I don't think the movie needed to be 3 hours, I'm not against long movies but I don't think the story was strong enough for a 3 hour film. The story itself was good but felt stretched out a bit for me, rather than a solid line it grew but felt distorted as we go along yet find itself in the last 30-40 minutesIt could be my cinema but damn so scenes were too loud, as beautiful as the visuals were, there was a few too many scenes of just swimming, I get that's it, the way of water but sometimes it felt like it was just there to be, ""look I'm pretty"" rather than having a point to the scene.Overall it's a top sequel and I'm quite intrigued to see where the series goes and I'm hoping for a third, I definitely recommend a cinema experience don't wait for streaming."
"""This family is our fortress""The triumph which have been waited for really really long finally return.The long waited 13 years are totally worth it.James Cameron's Hard Work Has Been Paid Of , This Movie Is So Good.Amazing CGI , Amazing Story, A New Powerful Bond Of Jake Sully With His Kids , Such Beautiful Moments.To Be Honest; I Didn't Even Feel Where Those 3 Hours Went Because It Was So Beautiful And If You Have Liked The First Part, Its James Cameron's Way Of Building Up The Story. Starting It Slow And Ending It With a Bang.Kiri was the one my favourite new addition in the sully's family and she is going to be much more than what we gave seen in Way Of Water. La'ok will become a great warrior that's for sure. Tuk is a kid, lets see where she goes.I Loved The Movie , Thanks James Cameron.Can't wait for another 2 years for the next franchise."
"ATWOW is simply stunning to the eye! JC's return doesn't disappoint providing a story with more depth, emotion and fantastic new characters.8 or 9 out of 10 is the rating this movie deserves to be. The only moments that let the movie down are some cheesy and cringey lines from the kids and Neytiri almost disappearing in the second act, otherwise, this movie is amazing and sets up the coming film's brilliantly. Worthington and Saldana provide the audience with incredible performances as they did in the first. Lang continues as Quaritch which is great considering his fantastic antagonist role in the first film, will be interesting to see his role in 3, 4 and 5. Finally, some great additions to the cast who play Jakes kids and those of the Metkayina clan. Will be interesting to see if Cameron can pull in some more A-listers for the coming sequels!IMAX and 3D is the way to go for this if you do decide to see it, you will not regret it.Unfortunately, people will hate this film as audiences are too critical these days, but it is what it is.Can't wait to be back in the cinemas for the third instalment!"
"When I saw the first Avatar (2009) I was just blown away by the 3D rendering and the richness and detail of the fictional world Pandora. It took that kind of screen technology to a new level. More than a decade later, Avatar: The Way of Water has the same impressive visual impact. The color palette is smooth and bright, the underwater world with all its new creatures is amazing, and it's all realized down to a level of detail that nothing else has reached. Seeing it in 3D is a must.But then we get to the storyline and the characters. This is where I have problems -- we've seen all this before in umpteen Western movies and their type. The human ""colonialists"" have once again arrived to shove aside and subdue the primitive natives, so that they can exploit Pandora's magical resources. In the first Avatar it was the mineral Unobtainium; in this one, it's a sort of whale oil that stops aging. The human soldiers all seem to be just thugs. And on top of this we have Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang), now resurrected and cloned into a Na'vi body, who's on a personal vendetta to find and kill our hero from the first movie, Jake Sully (Sam Worthington). Quaritch is just a stock, one-dimensional villain. (Say what you will about the Marvel superhero movies, at least they give their villains decent backstories.) I was constantly wondering, don't the people who are sent out on these interstellar expeditions have to pass some kind of qualification tests for things like ethics and common sense, let alone skill and intelligence? And then there are the gender stereotypes, unfortunately, that are repeated in both the human and Na'vi social structures. Everything in the characters and societies seems to be borrowed -- the Na'vi sea peoples that take up most of the story are straight-up Maoris, as far as I can see.Maybe I'm coming down too hard. My wife says that this same destructive storyline played out any time in our past where a more technically advanced culture moved in on a less advanced one, so why should it be any different here. And my son-in-law says I'm overthinking it anyway, because it's just entertainment. But I'm hoping the next one will have a better, more nuanced script.Incidentally, if you want to see this as an action movie you'll get all you likely wanted and more. The inevitable Big Showdown at the end goes on and on and on though. Too much.So in the end -- for the visuals and the richness of invention I give 10/10, and because movies are a visual medium by definition, that's a big factor. For the action -- maybe only 7/10 because it's overdone, and for the plot and character -- maybe 5/10 at best. Worth seeing? Certainly, and certainly in 3D."
"The movie runs for about 200 minutes a new norm in all tent pole movies these days. However, nowhere you feel the length or scroll your phone screens in theatre. That's the success of this movie and it's Director.Visual spectacle is at totally another level. The day light effect is such a welcome relief, most of films are dark today we need to shine torch on them to get a glimpse. Film makers can learn from Avatar to give us daylight photography. 3D is also very mature and subtle. Strongly recommend to see it in 3D IMAX screens only. It deserves the additional cost.Action set pieces are extremely well choreographed and there is no letup from the word go."
"So the cgi was amazing and the 3D effect stunning. It almost seemed real. But jeez this movie took forever to watch. The storyline was very bad, you were either looking at a documentary kinda vibes scenes or action scenes. And the weird thing was, that the action scenes were the most boring to watch. They took so long it felt almost useless to even watch it. I didn't really liked the character development of any of cast members. The best comparison for the movie is a Smurf themed Rocky movie. For the next film they should really try to put as much effort and time in the story than in the cgi. Hope it's gonna get better!"
"Expensive usually have negative conation but not in this case. That money was spent masterfully and it looks beautiful. I think the reviews that stress the 'mediocracy' of the story is missing a point. I don't think the story needs to be very deep and calculating in this world. I think this movie is more like a documentary where you're witnessing what's going on in one of the most mesmerizing places in the universe. So, I liked the simplicity of the story, and the credit should be given it does a great job of making you feel the emotions and drivers of the characters. Maybe there are some inconsistencies in terms of physics but not significant enough to annoy the viewer. On the other hand, in terms the inherent logic of psychology and biology embedded in the entire movie, I would say it was pretty satisfying. The directing and acting is smooth and lets you connect with the characters, and with the everlasting dreamy visuals, I'd give this one a solid 8."
"I thought this was excellent. I have no idea what this film's detractors are talking about?The first Avatar film is now 13 years behind us. Yes - 13! It set a new standard in eye-popping visuals. The story wasn't brilliant, but it was probably one that needed telling. Overall, I would give that 10. Groundbreaking and fantastic.Avatar: The Way of Water is just as good as the first film and it's similar in a lot of ways. The story isn't the best, in fact, there are times when you think, Mmmm... BUT, that doesn't stop The Way of Water being a great film.The point I'm trying to make is that the visuals here ARE JUST SO AMAZING that you can't take your eyes off the screen. You really are transported to the planet Pandora, in the thick of the action.The first few scenes in the sea are truly beautiful and awe inspiring. Breathtaking actually. Make no mistake, The Way of Water WILL win Oscars for special effects and the technical creative pieces around it.Sometimes films are great because everything comes together: script, story, acting, filming, soundtrack, and the film needs all these pieces in order to work it's magic on us. The Way of Water is not like this. It works not because of script or stuff like that, but because the visuals of this fantasic world of Pandora are so brilliant, so convincing.There are self-proclaimed ""purists"" who will review this film and find fault in it trying to make themselves look clever. They will express disappointment. They are missing the point. Avatar: The Way of Water is a technical and visual masterpiece. There is no equal to it: a new definition of ""the immersive experience"". Go and watch it in 3D, and leave Earth far behind."
"""The Sullys stick together. That is our greatest weakness and our greatest strength.""""Avatar: The Way of Water"" succeeds in visual storytelling and world building yet falters in delivering a cohesive screenplay. The visual effects and cinematography of the film are astounding, and straight away immerses the viewer into the world of Pandora. The sequel surpasses the original when it comes to the visual effects and cinematography, while the first film succeeds in telling a more straightforward and cohesive story. The sequel unfortunately has some inconsistencies in the plot. Chief among them is Colonel Miles Quaritch's motivations and surprising re-emergence. What was he trying to accomplish? How was he even brought back from the dead? So, he wants to enact his revenge on the Sully family for his murder but does not reflect upon his actions and the destruction his vendetta causes on the ecosystem. My heart pounded excessively during the third act, and even clenched my fists to suppress my anger and frustration with Colonel Quaritch. I thought that he was portrayed as rather weak in this sequel as opposed to the first film. Jake should have bashed his head and made sure he was dead.Spider's spur of the moment decision to save his father's Avatar sets up the third instalment of the franchise. His character arc sort of represents the notion of nature vs nurture. I reckon that Spider is going to have an identity crisis and betray the Na'vi. Is Spider supposed to be a knockoff of Tarzan? I loved the subtle nods to Rambo, Jerry Maguire, Titanic, and Tarzan in the film.The message of the film (at least one of them) is that running away from your problems won't solve anything. Jake and Neytiri abandoned their entire tribe to protect their family and did not think about the repercussions of their actions. They put another tribe at risk and did not have the decency to travel back to their home and check up on their compatriots.Neytiri going on a rampage after witnessing the death of her eldest son is one of my favourite moments of the film. It exemplifies the strong message of love and family that the sequel encompasses. I also loved how the film focused on the new generation of the Na'vi, while Jake and Neytiri are reduced to side characters.To fully enjoy this sequel, one must recognize and accept its flaws, while still admiring the amazing visuals, the explosive action set pieces, and the stunning beauty of Pandora. The film is above all else a visuals-first experience. I have no doubt in my mind that the film is going to win best cinematography and best visual effects at the Academy Awards.""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is one of the most exhilarating and immersive cinematic experiences in recent memory and will stick with me for a while. The breath-taking visuals of the film left me in awe and in a state of euphoria. Watching this epic blockbuster in 3D only enhanced the cinematic experience. At first, I thought the sequel would surpass the original by a large margin, but as the film progressed cracks in the story started appearing. Regardless, The Way of Water is still a visual spectacle in every conceivable way.""The Way of Water has no beginning and no end. The sea is around you and in you. The sea is your home, before your birth and after your death.""Final verdict: 7.5/10."
"It is sad that we waited 13 years for this story. The scale of the story is confusing. It builds up well initially and then loses track. The writers tried to portray complex father-son relationships but fails horribly. It often feels stupid about the twists and turns in the plot. The movie fails tragically in most parts where lot of the things feel repetitive and does not explore interesting possibilities, keeping audience craving for more.Watching the first movie on IMAX 3D was amazing in 2009. The same visuals does not feel as amazing anymore. I don't care what inventions were made and what amazing technologies were used for filming the movie. It did not work for me. I would have been happier with a better story line.The initial under water sequences were interesting, specially when the sully family trains and tries to adapt to the ""way of water"". But then most of it was unexplored.The character arc of Kiri made no sense. Why din't she have more screen time.Mr. Cameron lost me during the climax. It was messed up. The action sequence were stupid. There were loads of missing details and stupid logic. Some of the emotions were not mature enough, specially the type of death that was portrayed in the climax.I strongly feel James Cameron should have made a teen movie to clear his pallet before making the Avatar 2."
"This movie is worse than I could have possibly imagined. Every character acts like a moron the entire time (especially the teenagers). Same villain, same story. All the female leads are extremely weak (Neytiri was the best character in the first one). Kiris daughter has a storyline that never really gets explored (in 3 friggen hours!!!!) and makes zero sense. There was zero creativity in this movie, wasn't everyone expecting insane alien ocean life?? It's a movie about humpback whales with more fins. There were a few minutes of coral reef (just like earth) and schools of fish. Like seriously am I taking crazy pills? This was worse than the new Jurassic Park movies wow."
"I'll start by saying this film is no lesser than its predecessor, it build the world very well introducing a lot of new Characters. I do not understand the hate people are giving it and honestly I think a lot of it has to do with people just simply wanting it to fail without actually watching the film. The special effects are maybe the best I have ever seen and James Cameron remains the best at what he does, that is a simple fact.I look forward to seeing where we will go next and I'll be there first weekend waiting as you can only have so many superheroes and at the moment with Marvel at a low and DC in tatters, I'm excited to have Avatar back with the future bright!."
"I have mixed feelings about this film - I loved the experience, but I still think the first one was better and more focused.From the start, The Way of Water tries very hard to differentiate itself from its predecessor. After a brief prologue sequence recounting the aftermath of Avatar, we are treated to a sudden time skip that parallels the real life wait for the sequel. Instead of Jake Sully the warrior newcomer, we now see Jake Sully the experienced commander and father, accompanied by a dizzying number of new child characters who take centre stage. Each of these children has their own personality, goals, backstory and connections, from the mysterious Kiri to the (admittedly hard to tell apart) brothers to the indecisive Spider to the little Tuk. The film takes time to really establish their interactions and make them act like a family, before thrusting them into entirely new circumstances, making the story feel quite fresh and averting my fears that it would just be a repeat of the first film.Once the Sully family exiles themselves to some remote islands, the film throws in even more characters and doubles the size of the cast. I don't remember their names, I just remember that one of them had the broccoli haircut, and of course I had to take a star off for that. If it sounds overstuffed at this point, you'd be right. In its attempt to do every character and plotline justice, the film starts to drag. Demoted back to newcomers, the family gets to grips with their new environment and builds bonds with the new tribe and each other, which is also an opportunity to revel in underwater scenery. This is when the film shines, but also when its three hour runtime becomes obvious.By the final act, the film has explored the setting of Pandora far beyond the confines of the forest in the first film, yet the stakes feel smaller. The action scenes are intense and non-stop, yet the only thing at risk in the battle is a whaling ship and the hostages, a far cry from the entire planetary intelligence in the previous installment. The climactic fistfight between Jake and the resurrected Quaritch is far less dramatic than the battle in the first film. This move to a smaller scope is probably deliberate, as the film wants us to focus on Jake's family, and it pays off as we know each member intimately by the end and feel like we have grown alongside them.The sequel's strength is how it (almost) balances its many juggling acts. It makes an effort to connect with the storyline of the first film, yet also presents the audience with a barrage of new material. Long time fans will be pleased to see familiar characters and settings alongside the previously unseen oceans and creatures of Pandora (the film's creators know that we've seen hours of the forests already). It also makes an effort to present a satisfying and self-contained story, yet also sets up storylines for the next sequels. Unanswered questions like Kiri's true nature or Spider's allegiance pique the interest of the audience without feeling like a cop-out. The individual plotlines of the characters are all balanced against each other and returning characters are given new roles to play, especially Quaritch, who feels far more interesting and fleshed out in this iteration. However, as mentioned, the film does get bloated when it tries to to explore so many characters, so perhaps this is one juggling act where it starts to drop the ball.On the negative side, The Way of Water still inherits a lot of the first film's faults that the series just can't shake off. The humans are still cartoonishly evil and ludicrously inept, which makes the stakes unclear. The exhaust of a landing rocket incinerates the forest, leading to an even bigger base than before, instantly undoing the Na'vi's victory of the first film (why don't they always do that?). The humans and their technology are treated as an oppressive threat but are also dispatched with incredible ease (especially anybody sitting in a cockpit), depending on the needs of the script from scene to scene. Even the ""elite"" soldiers who are resurrected in Na'vi bodies fare little better than disposable fodder, dropping left, right and centre without posing a real challenge (other than a dated Vietnam War reference). We don't actually see the humans' motivations until about halfway through the movie, when an overzealous captain holds up a vial of a precious resource, cites a dollar amount and whines about quotas, in a scene directly ripped from the first movie. Despite its supposed importance, we never see this resource again. It's all so maddeningly simplistic.I haven't yet addressed the elephant in the room - the visual effects. The effects in this film were so realistic that I wasn't consciously wowed or impressed, I was just totally immersed in the experience. I watched this film in Dolby 3D with high frame rate but I legitimately can't remember noticing anything in 3D or high frame rate because the immersion was too good (as strange as it sounds). When I came into this movie, I wasn't sure how special effects technology could possibly progress even more than current blockbusters, but James Cameron has outdone himself again and given us another leap ahead. This is probably the closest I'll get to seeing life on another planet until Avatar 3.All in all, I do think this film was a good experience, but it was trying to do too many things at once, and was not as streamlined or personal as the first Avatar, which had a clear focus on Jake Sully rather than an entire ensemble. If the first film was Pocahontas in space, this one is Free Willy in space - and Moby Dick in space - and The Abyss in Space - and Titanic in space - and... you get the idea."
"Avatar 2 starts from where it ended and this time, Sully has formed his own army to protect his tribe . However, to protect his family, Jake Sully decides to keep them protected with the water tribe's help hence the name ""Way of Water"". However, as usual, the Sky people come back to poke their nose into their business hence evoking yet another massive war.If you notice very carefully, Mr. Cameron has very smartly used the exact same story as the 2009 avatar. A group from a different tribe landing into another tribe , learning their ways, some emotional bonds, an ultimate long battle between sky people and the Na'vis , and ultimately becoming one of the tribe members. This was the same formula of Avatar and now also in Avatar 2. Very smart Mr. Cameron.Coming to the performances, it's again terrific. This time the film focuses more on Sully's kids as they are new to the world of Avatar and how they ultimately become fighters. Emotions are there in perfect proportions, evoking smiles and tears just when needed and not unnecessarily. Cameron is a master of emotions and his film Titanic too was a proof.No doubt it is a visual spectacle. The underwater scenes are absolute breathtaking and in 3D , the experience is surreal. Do not watch it in 2D at any cost, unless you cannot afford 3d or imax.Climax was yet again pretty similar to the first Avatar, intense but this time , it's even more stretched to the point that i was not very happy. At the beginning of the climax i was enjoying every bit but once after sometime you will realise, that things are just not ending and that's were you feel bored rather than more excited.Cameron, in the final bits of the climax battle sequence, gives a mini tribute to his own film Titanic lol. You watch the film to understand it. I wish Cameron could have chopped off this Titanic section.Overall, Avatar is a visual treat but in terms of story, nothing new . It will definitely extend into a 3rd film and i hope Cameron does not paste the same concept story again there otherwise my ratings will go down further."
When the first Avatar was released it wasn't guaranteed that there would be a sequel. So that movie wrapped up very neatly. This time around JC is building a bigger world knowing there will be at least one more movie so there was a lot left undone and in doing so made the movie feel incomplete.JC is using Pandora as the backdrop to a larger family drama. I enjoyed the first one better but after letting the second sit and stew for a few days I can see there is more to the story and a lot was left unsaid. Such as Kira. Her story fascinated me but was left unresolved in this chapter. I hope in the 3rd film they go further into her connection to Aywa and her mother.
"This movie's a Western set in space where the ""indians"" are the good guys and the cowboys are the bad, oh! So very bad guys. In these days of extreme pollical correctness, we are bound to suffer these things.I appreciate the beautiful special effects, but three hours of color-saturated shots with no compelling argument is too much. The shallow calls for ""away with technology and let's be one with Nature"" sounds infantile and hypocritical, given all the high-tech dumped in this movie.There I was at the dine-in movie theater in my spacious reclinable chair and munching on a delicious burger, while I'm being told I really should be trotting half-naked in a loin-cloth without pockets to put my phone and all exposed to rain and cold. Not me, thank you very much.I have to give it to James Cameron, though. He knows how to fill his wallet and come out like the planet-saving hero."
"Waited for many years for this movie to come out, just to be dissapointed over and over with it being postponed over and over, just for this!? Comon what a slap in the face in my point of view, visual effects are great i cant deny that, so that i will give them, its amazing, but its almost a complete retelling of the first movie just in water and with some old made up baggage from some characters that should not be in the movie in the first place like Kiri and Spider, who seems to have been badly made up from nowhere just for it to have a chance for some kind of plot... its cheap to say the least, so thats the SLAP* ouch, and it will burn for another 13 years wtf and i really love Cameron, and the work he has done before, but this??? And the stupid annoying charaters doing what alot of characters do in movies just going against all logic and what they are told, this time even during WARTIME and putting themselves and others in danger over and over, its like movies when the ONLY most important thing u need NOT do, THEY DO!!!! Over and over, like in a scary movie encountering a monster but it havent seen u yet, u just need to be quiet and back away and hide, what do they do, yeah they swalllow loudly from being scared or sneeze!!!! And there it is they spot you!! Those kind of stupid annoying things and its packed of it! Comon!!! Thats not quality work, its just stupid and frustrating and NO ONE WOULD DO THAT but they do in lack of other good things to make it a real movie i guess.. my feeling is that someone just wanted to show the tech of making nice visuals but couldnt come up with a good enough plot but they still ran with it! And its a waste of alot of expectations and MONEY and in a way TRUST from us fans cuz this happens alot lately in many kinds of movies and series... but anyway thx for trying! But a 15min online shortfilm like bladerunnner black out 2022 would have been enough to fill these boots cuz its mostly the same all over again with some new confusing stuff that dont fit!"
"Firstly, don't get me wrong. Avatar: The way of water is a very good movie. Is it better than the first? Not for me. The original Avatar was a beautiful film that had a simple narrative construct that was uncomplicated and panned out well, whereas this one was a bit frustrating in a sense.But first, a note about watching the film in 3D...I was excited to get the full 3D experience everyone talks about, yet from the get go felt that the glasses dimmed the whole experience, like I wanted to dial the brightness up. Lifting the glasses up and down it's clear that the original content balance and grade is just compromised with the glasses. Because each lens has to block out certain colours, that's the way it works. Those beautiful, vibrant blues of the water for example just felt a bit washed out. If I had known about this a little more I would have 100% watched it in 2D and I've already recommended this to several people. It may be personal taste but I also found that a some of the layers created with depth of field just aren't great as there is a lot of unusual fringing and out of focus elements that sort of gets in the way of the overall scene. I love photography and technical aspects of this sort of craft, but seeing it again in a modern 3D film just had me paying more attention to these elements rather than just passively taking it all in.Finally, onto the plot... or more so, the overall impression.Without giving away any spoilers, what I will say is that for me on reflection, 24 hours after seeing the movie, I keep thinking about many aspects that are just too far fetched. There is an over-reliance on Quaritch as the chief villain and how his character unfolds. This sense of frustration doesn't quite leave me wanting more just yet, more so wishing it panned out differently.Will I watch it again? Absolutely, but not in 3D and not in a rush. Very good movie though and a solid 7/10."
"Well, I finally got around to watching Avatar: the Way of Water. As expected, the visuals were fantastic. That doesn't make a good movie for me though.I've heard from some that this film was heartless; amazing to look at, but you don't really care about the characters. I actually found myself caring about each character. I even teared up a few times. I love the lessons it teaches about family and the importance of it. The story was solid and had me engaged.It felt a tad overlong to me, but I think the runtime was justified. It turned out to be a great popcorn flick.Something that bothers me a little about the movie was the 'Locals good, humans bad' dichotomy. The environmentalist virtues and lack thereof were pretty blatant. It gets kind of annoying seeing that repeatedly in movies... Anyways, I wish the humans were given a little more character, and not just seen as drones with shells of humanity, you know? Most people are not that indecent!9/10 for me."
"The good news is that this film is less likely to get Dances with Wolves or Pocahontas comparisons like the first film. No, Way of Water is neither of these movies. The bad news is that Avatar Way of Water is... well, it's hardly anything. Which is weird because it is also a lot of everything. Lots of characters, lots of storylines.. So much that no character or storyline is developed to its potential. It's very bare bones, and therefore you can't help but feel empty.The film's editing is not good like its predecessor's was, with some scenes and story segments ending abruptly to move the others forward while others were too long and could have benefited from trimming. Say what you will about the first movie's story, but that film's pacing was great and helped the film flow well. That is not the case here.The final 45 minutes of this film offers incredible action and set pieces. It's very much ""Terminator 2""-esque: just when you think the action is over, something happens to amp the action up again; and just when you think it's over for real this time, something else happens and now the action is super intense. It's what James Cameron does best. That said, I didn't care for the characters like I cared for the characters in T2. Those characters were memorable, and I was invested in what happened to them as the action progressed. Here, however, the action looks very cool, but I'm not invested in the characters, so the action can only be so compelling.I had high expectations for this film, which I think is fair given the 13 year wait. Perhaps I had my sights too high. The way I see it, this film needed to be exceptional on almost every level (given his reputation, I was more than ready to forgive Cameron's screenplay quality so long as it showed signs of improvement in his writing abilities), and in the end it's really not- minus the groundbreaking visuals of course.A few more final points. (1) The score is not that memorable. I know James Horner is no longer with us and Simon Franglen is doing the best he can in his place, but I have to say it as it is. His score leaves much to be desired.(2) They really use Jake's narration as an expositional crutch in this film, and it bothered me a lot. It was fine in Avatar 1 because his character was doing a video log, but now in the sequel, that's all over with. The only reason you hear Jake narrating events in the movie is because Cameron doesn't seem to know how else to explain things to the audience."
Went and saw this in IMAX 3D and this was no where near as good as the first one.Since the last one Jake & Neytiri now all of a sudden now has a whole family. They rushed through that and then there's a couple weird things like; Kiri was Grace's Avatar's offspring and that Spider's father is Colonel Quaritch & both are now part of Jake & Neytiri's family.The first one had so much of the WOW factor & this one even being over 3 hours just didn't do it for me with all the shoot um up & the 3D just didn't meet up to the great standards of the 1st one. Wasn't worth all the money paid & theater full of empty seats as there was only one other couple & a small family.Also didn't like how Spider saves his Avatar father character leading up to a 3rd film that I probably won't go and see.
"What a stunning film. Visually impeccable and breathtaking for the entire 3+ hour duration of Avatar II. That needs to be said from the jump; cinematically magnificent.I enjoyed the story and the expansion of the world of Pandora. This movie reminded me what had me spellbound 13 years ago when the original movie was released. The magic of the people and the beauty of the place. This film felt like a lot of world building for the future films. It wasn't totally plot heavy, but I felt that was by design.The main thing working against this movie for me was the drug out ending. I didn't feel that this lengthy movie was too stagnant until the last half hour. It felt like it refused to just be over and could've had 20 minutes lopped off the end, if not more.Overall a really great return to this fantasy world. I am invested in where we go from here!"
"The one thing that strikes brilliantly is where all the lead casts comes up with a finest performance,showing vivid expressions & emotions....
Cameron spins the decade old sequel tecnically sound & nothing short of a gem crafted with excellency,already mastered the aquatic journey through his documentry eases him in mastering the visuals keeping the hiatious 3hr runtime delighted....
Most of the characters were developed with some time to build where one remember even coming out of pandora to the day to routines, especially payakan is a Trump card and the characters communicating each other via unique sign language shows the passion towards the art...
Though Russell carpenter's camera & Simon's music are apt it shows the Cameron's input that's tested at times...
Overall a visually stunning masterpiece that demands a 3D IMAX experience or don't bother to watch in usual format."
This movie is a treat to watch. You will be lost in this World and will not feel that anything is unreal even for a second. Right amount of drama and action is used. Director spends time for viewers to get to know the World and feel for whatever is happening with characters and even animals. Complexity of certain characters captured is very well along with simplicity of Jake Sully whose whole agenda is family now and wants to take care of them by any means. Attention to detail for those living on ground and those under water is marvellous and in itself shows Director's great vision which he could draw on the movie canvas and we could watch it. Definitely a watch with family.
"After waiting so long time and travelling 130kms distance Finally I have watched Avatar 2 in 3D with my whole Family. So Struggle for Avatar was real for me.. We reached theatre 5min late but hooked with the story in very first moment. It just took 5min to settle everyone with the 3D glasses,because most of them were watching 3D movie for the very first time including my Mother.SO the Technical aspects of this movie is really fabulous and the BGM of all the scenes were quite nice to listen. Although it was 3hr 10min+ movie yet no one get bored of a single minute and got a visually nice experience as well. This time storyline was pretty average and it's plot revolves around family and revenge that's it..'The Way Of WATER'- The title justified this entire movie..The water shots were really treat to watch and a complete Family movie for sure.. I will go with 8 Out of 10 Stars for it.. I watched it in theatre that's why I am going with 8 Stars otherwise If I'm gonna watch it in my TV or OTT then 6 out of 10 will be fare due to it's high running time and not that much effective storyline,and there will be no 3D enjoyment in TV or Ott..."
"My star rating is for the visual effects, and visual effects alone. Considering we waited over a decade for this movie, the plot should be better.The entire plot is garbage. Firstly, I've never seen NASA land on any planet in a blaze of fire, and immediately start bulldozing the place.Secondly, the government would not sanction all that time and resources to go after one man, living peacefully with his family.Thirdly, what is with the creepy cryo pregnancy!?!? And they cast Sigourney Weaver to play her own daughter! Her adult voice, coming out or a child's mouth sounds ridiculous. Not only that, but there's a huge plot hole with Kiri and her mystery birth/ magical powers. Unless they are building up plot for a third movie, they never fully explained where they were going with this plot line.They clearly just wanted to make a movie about water, to show their visual effects. With the amount of time, budget, resources, etc. That went into this movie, you'd think the plot would be better."
"The basic concept of this film is the family and being the protector of that family. It's great to see a film that bring back the hero father out to be a protector. The story has the Sulley family living life happily, a savage in a savage world, when the humans return. For starters I'm not of fan of having humanity shown as the bad guys, I for one have no problem with exploring, colonizing and building a new world for humanity. The blue monkeys are doing nothing but living a Stone Age life. But apart from that it is an extremely well made movie, with a believable story executed perfectly. But I still don't like the blue monkeys being the good guys."
"I suppose it's possible to like a movie but disike the storyline, right? Visuals were epic, as expected. I felt very let down by the storyline - American army man wants revenge so bad he travels back to this other universe for a second time to try and kill one man/blue. I couldn't do better myself but that's not my job, thankfully, because it must be very hard to think of a new concept for a second movie. Its like they used the story from the first Avatar and tweeked a few things, added some really big names to the cast, put them in water instead of trees and there you have it. I know its fiction but that mission would never be approved because of the astronomical cost and the cause.. like, get over it dude. Fragile masculinity."
"Avatar: The Way Of Water, A cinematic masterpiece. A film which provides the viewer with a visual spectacle like no other.Avatar does not have a super complicated or crazy storyline but what it does have is a simple, beautiful story that continues the epic we all first fell in love with back in 2009. Avatar: The Way Of Water follows Jake, Ney'tiri and their family living peacefully on Pandora until the humans return wanting revenge and a place to settle... permanently.When I first watched the original Avatar I always assumed a sequel would have the humans return and go toe to toe with the natives of Pandora again. However while simple and expected it brings with it a absolute bounty of audio and visual beauty that will make you want to rewatch the movie just to take in all the sights and sounds that you missed the first time around.So lets start with storyline, it's simple and easy to predict as already mentioned, but it's also heartwarming and suits the tone and style of the movie perfectly as it focuses more on Jake and Ney'tiri's family then the previous film while still giving the world of Pandora time to shine. I've heard many people say the story was to predictable or boring. I disagree however as I think the storyline does everything it set out to do. Which is bring the world of Pandora back into the spotlight and leave the viewer wanting more at the end.The visuals were just mind blowing, While getting to see the beauty of Pandora's forests and it's creatures again you are also introduced to an entirely new realm, the ocean. The unique plants and animals which live there and the 250 million dollar budget which makes it one of the most visually stunning films of the decade. Not to mention that the daughter of the Chief of the Metkayina reef people is absolutely beautiful. Seriously I'd definitely become a Na'vi like Jake Sully did if she was in the picture haha.Anyway onto the SFX, what can I say beyond it was perfect for the movie. It lent an entire new depth to the film and put the movies massive budget to good use.The acting was superb all around. I have nothing bad to say about any of the acting or voice acting. Those that stood out were Tsireya (The very beautiful daughter of the chief of Metkayina clan), Kiri (Grace's Avatar's daughter?) and Tuk the youngest of Jake's children.Overall what else can I say beyond I am one of the people who absolutely loved the movie and felt that it was an amazing sequel to the original Avatar. Well done to Director and visionary James Cameron on another World Wide blockbuster. 10/10 from me! I can't rate it any lower with how much I enjoyed it. So go ahead watch it in 3D at least or IMAX if you can and enjoy the beauty of the world of Pandora."
"No matter what would be the message of the movie -and the way it is nurtured from today's world political agenda - and no matter how exotic and seemingly spectacular visuals and scenography of the movie are, the same elements (more artificial than natural) could not bestow charisma and beauty to the Avatar's cast and its respective bad casting.Just remind yourself of- and take a look back at many classical masterpieces and the genuine beauty of their casting as well as their masterful directions- this movie is far from satisfying your eyes and mind: particularly if you are looking for good sense and loveliness. The movies such as Avatar series just intend to infuse enormous exotic scenes and actions together with ugly and unsavory cast so that you forget the genuine beauty and to convince you that this would be the movie that justifies spending your money to pay for entrance ticket at this hard time of inflation and high interest rate and finally to convince you to accept the ugliness of the cast as something a la mode and modernity.In short; I desire to have my money and time back which is impossible; rather I urge you to keep the ticket money for this movie in your pocket and find a better way of using it than nurturing the producers that use ugly images in a colourful manner."
"Just like in the other rare examples where sequels were better, Lord of The Rings, The Dark Knight, Empire Strikes Back, and actually not one but two of James Cameron's movies, Terminator 2 Judgement Day and Aliens, he did it with this one as well, at least in my opinion.My biggest concern going in was who was going to be the bad guy again....is it going to be just people coming back again with bigger, stronger, faster weapons, etc but it was totally averted by doing something I really did not expect and it just opened up so many other narrative threads this can evolve into.No point in mentioning visuals and graphics here, it is just another chapter that he and his team completely excelled at, it does look better than the first and the craze behind the water element and underwater scenes live up to the hype.I hope it makes the money necessary to make the 4th and the 5th Avatar movies as I've heard the 3rd is already nearly complete.One single complaint though and it's not even about the movie itself.At current state, 3D is just not something I enjoy, personally i think it's a gimmick, darkens the image and just blurs out content, I only watch 2d which would've been fine but for some reason all IMAX and Superscreens are showing only 3D so i had to watch it on a small standard screen and this is definitely a BIG screen event.Usually for all other big movies before Avatar there was always an option for IMAX and SS 2D version, i guess they just have ...reasons but nonetheless, the movie is a FEAST, go watch it!"
"This movie looks realistic, nothing to say about it!Avatar is THE movie that looks insanely good, and even for this 2nd chapter, Camoron have puted uears of work for this final result.But...The storyline isn't that good.Don't give me wrong, i'm 24yo, I'm not in audience target for this movie, which is a family movie, made for childrens, teens and parents, which can see themself in one or more characters inside the movie.But i understand that, I'm aware.Still, i think this is the same story of 1st avatar just a little bit edited...
That's kind of boring.I understand that this movie deals with different topics, starting from the environment, the greedy humans, the family, emotions etc.V
But none of these topics really goes deep down, and everything gets scratched just on the surface.This is just a good movie, but those person that says it's like watch a 'youtube 4k demo' video... they're right!"
"Another visual MASTERPIECE by the man himself James Cameron. This movie is nothing short of REMARKABLE. I saw it on IMAX and i was looking for 1 visual flaw, fake or that it didn't belong.... I couldn't find one in the entire 3hr. This movie is perfection on itself.The story is about family and unlike the Fast and Furious family theme, this one actually does explore what that is. Union, family, love, compassion, strength, all of these topics are explored across this film in a masterful way.James Cameron can take the most basic of plots and the most basic of sets and turn them into a very complex original work of art. The entire final fight in the marine ship during the day looked very basic but then at night, it turns into an action survival arena that helps develop the family relation even more.I could keep going, this film is a cinema expectable like no other."
"This does not feel like a James Cameron movie at all. I'm a huge fan of the first Avatar movie, it's such a focused story, with a begining, middle and end that all make sense and make the viewer feel good, and this sequel does not have anything close to that.So let's rip this stinker up, shall we? (no spoilers, but then again there is no story, so...)the Navi can now talk telepathically with some animals, no hair connection thingy needed! And the conversations are like the ones you would have with a human: ""so how's it going?"" ""meh, you know, can't complain"". Awesome stuff.the story does not develop at all: what you see in the beginning of the movie is exactly how things end up in the end, minus some shallow characters deaths, who don't matter at allthere's hardly any humans around. Now this is really important, because in the first movie they always went back and forth with the Humans / Navi body swapping and so you always felt a (human) connection. In this movie the screentime is 99% focused on the Navi, so it's hard to feel any connection to these characters.there's no expansion of stuff from the first movie, like Eiwa, or the connection between Avatar and human mind, all interesting subjects that should have been exploredyou will get hours of underwater footage and spiritual quotes that only made me fall asleep: ""the ocean is with you"" ""you are one with the ocean"" bla bla bla, just move on with the story, will you?!I haven't had such a big disappoinment in years, and coming from Cameron, the guy who is definitely my favorite director of all times.Needless to say I won't be eager to watch the next sequels: ""Avatar 3 the sway of wind"" with some more memorable quotes: ""the air is allaround you... no wait that was a fart"".Lousy experience."
"I loved Avatar - 1 a lot. The pandora world is still stuck to my head. The 3D from the first movie was so refreshing , new , organic , we all felt we visited pandora. The second movie visually is good , but it really lacks in story and bogged down repeated events. The children making error after error and main characters going behind them to fix it or loose someone becomes the entire theme of the movie. The underwater experience is rich , refreshing and it should be enjoyed fully in the big screen.One of the glaring issue for me for the frame rate. At times it felt like i am playing a game(48-9999 FPS) , another time enjoying a solid movie (24fps). Some fight scenes look they are taken straight out of game.The core , the story is simply a deep black pit , nothing there , the pit is covered my eye popping foliage.. Will you step on it ?"
"""Avatar 2"" is a visually stunning and emotionally powerful sequel that builds upon the world and characters introduced in the first ""Avatar"" movie. The movie's state-of-the-art special effects and immersive underwater environments are truly breathtaking, and the performances of the cast, particularly Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana, are strong and compelling. The movie's themes of family, environmentalism, and the importance of preserving the natural world are well-developed and poignant, and the action scenes are exciting and well-choreographed. While the movie's lengthy runtime and slow-paced storytelling may not appeal to all viewers, fans of the first ""Avatar"" movie and science fiction in general are sure to be impressed by this epic and emotionally satisfying adventure. Overall, ""Avatar 2"" is a must-see for fans of the franchise and anyone interested in the future of cinema."
"This movie is a dimension beyond your highest expections. Each and every aspect associated with the movie surpasses the the wildest thresholds your imagination is capable of setting. Beautifully directed evergreen epic, from direction to cinematography and from music to insane visuals. The storyline, acting, dialogues, CGI all in totality are exceptionally brilliant and really you cannot ask for more. Spine chilling stunner, theatre 3d experience uplifts it to even more crazy dimension. Now, the navi will transform themselves into sea people's. Jake sulleys journey was definitely a heavy rollercoaster ride, from the sky people to the navis and now the sea people's. James Cameron imagination and creative abilities are not of this earth, they too seem to be taken from Pandora. One of the best movie we as a human kind have witnessed. Emotionally appealing and full of concrete life lessons. This movie series also provides a small window into the future of our species, humans are only 150-200 years away from doing this in reality. The dimension of colonization which was gone for good will make a comeback in a twisted interplanetary sense. And if you are wondering, yes we will discover evolved life forms and developed civilizations beyond earth before 2100."
"This movie is 3 hours and 12 minutes of no plot. The animation was phenomenal as well as the imagery. No argument there. The foreshadowing of a later event is poorly hidden and thus cheapens the film. There are other plot holes as well. James Cameron also seems to be stuck on themes, earth is not my home, forest is not my home, water is not my home, etc. A subplot regarding a whale creature could have gone into more detail as well. The first movie has adventure sprinkled throughout. This one saved it up for the end and bc we somewhat knew what to expect, just the basics is flying or riding an animal isn't enough to cut it anymore."
"This movie really didn't have much of a plot. For a 3hr movie a lot didn't really happen. It was more of a visual introduction into Pandora (which we got in the first movie). The movie was gorgeous no doubt about it but if I'd seen this movie in a format other than imax 3d I would have hated it.Outside of the lack of plot, the only thing that I didn't like in this movie was Kiri's voice (the teenaged female Avatar). It was very obvious the character was voiced by a much older actor both in sound and phrasings. It was jarring when she spoke and I felt uncomfortable just thinking about this actor and the child actors together especially those scenes with Spyder. Not sure who figured this would be a good idea."
"""Avatar"" was a completely immersive experience. Sitting in the theater with my 3-D goggles on, I remember feeling like I had never seen anything quite like it. It was one of those movies, like ""Star Wars,"" ""Terminator 2,"" ""Jurassic Park,"" ""Titanic,"" and ""The Matrix,"" that brought visual effects forward in leaps and bounds and expanded the scope of what movies could do.""Avatar: The Way of Water,"" felt very underwhelming in comparison. Those visual effects aren't all that impressive anymore, or at least they're not fresh. The motion capture is much improved -- my kids were amazed when I told them they weren't just watching actors in makeup -- but the rest is just a CGI fest that you've seen a hundred times before. I didn't see this film in 3-D, so maybe that was part of my disappointment. But if your movie sinks or swims based on whether you see it in 3-D or not, it's probably not that good of a movie in the first place.The story of this one is rubbish. My heart sank when I realized they were bringing back the same exaggerated caricature of a villain and making this a revenge story. That's the best they could do? And they want to make four more movies out of this? I'll pass. This entire movie felt like filler, setting up a bunch of plot strands to be resolved in later episodes, but the problem is that I don't care enough about any of them to bother seeing how they're resolved.The whales were cool.Grade: B-"
"I'm not a Avatar-hater. The first film, especially the first half, is exceptional because it expertly draws you into this new creation, new world, it's exhilarating.James Cameron is also one of the great directors of all time, giving us an oeuvre of timeless classics. No one doubts his ability to craft engaging action films and to innovate.This? Nothing new being told, a lot of mish-mash scenes of chaos, no emotional investment, exhausting action scenes, too in love with its own mythos to ever ask, ""Will the audience care about any of this?"" I barely did.Of course it's way too long. It becomes an exercise in audience-endurance.It also shouldn't have had a sequel. If you want to do a sequel, take us to a new planet, new race, new story. Maybe show us a little bit of Pandora, if you wanted to tie up loose ends, then move on to a new planet, and explore the universe a little more. It's 13 years later and we're not that excited to see this tribe again.I need not get into the plot holes, they've already been covered here thoroughly. The story is so poorly constructed.It's hard to believe the sequels will be better. How do you drag this non-story out for three more movies? What is there to tell? ""Tribe is in danger, bad Earth people are back to destroy environment."" That's all it is."
"The story and the relationships don't work. The movie doesn't make me care about them and so I am not invested in their journey. Fury Road had much better relationships and it did it with less time and fewer words.The character arcs don't work either. No real learning happens and the characters just wander from one scene to the next.The antagonist doesn't work either. The central conflict feels artificial.The fight scenes are not interesting because I don't care about the characters and they are confusing.Yes, the visuals are stunning but all that beauty doesn't matter if the emotions are not there. I would not watch it again!"
"From the first time i watched Avatar back in 2012 or so, i was very upset that i missed this visual masterpiece in theater. 10 Years later after watching it for several times in tv, this year i finally got the opportunity to watch the movies re-release in 3D on theater and man that was some experience. From that day onwards i was waiting for the 2nd film to hit the theater and watching Avatar the way of water on the very first day is an experience on itself. The visuals as usual is stunning and some scenes we literally out of this world. The 3D really utilizes our peripheral vision because some scenes i felt the characters are coming from the far corner. The story is emotionally attached to the place and we overserves will be involved and will feel like we are there watching the whole thing unfold before our eyes. The music, the sounds of everything happening are top notch and i could go on explaining how great everything was. But for now go enjoy this visual masterpiece of a movie for you self. The direction of Cameron, the performance of the cast, the effort from the whole visual effects team pays off in this long movie that is full on engaging and entertaining."

Amazing visuals. Engineering equipment designs are pristine. Predictable story. I guess it is laying a good foundation to the upcoming sequels.Writing was narrow. Editing could have been better.Can see the efforts, which are tremendous."
"Avatar: The Way of Water once again proves.... that you can seriously inflate your box office numbers by charging three times the regular ticket price for 3D IMAX viewing. This sequel isn't anything special. In fact, it's less special than the original because there doesn't seem to have been any improvement in the visual effects since 2009. Also, The Way of Water is so long that my fingers started getting pruney near the end. They could have cut at least two of the excessive storylines. This movie is like a beautiful, yet bloated, nature documentary, with one-dimensional 3D characters. This franchise must be stopped."
"Not bad! Not bad at all! I'm not a huge Avatar fan. The first film was just alright to me, but I think I liked this film a little more. The story was different and didn't feel like a story we have seen before like the first film. The effects are of course Top Tier. My only complaints are that I felt Spider's character was super confusing and I never understood his motivations at all, even at the end. And I don't think this is worth 3 hours and 12 minutes. You really feel the run time. But the ending was pretty great so I forgive it more than I probably should. Overall I'm surprised by how much I enjoyed it, and I'm thrilled to have seen a James Cameron film in cinemas."
"The sequel to James Cameron, whose films I grew up with for years. After 13 years, this movie, which I have been waiting for, did not give me what I wanted. The focus is on visual quality so much that its story is forgotten. It was a movie that I couldn't find what I wanted in the story part. If we focus on visual quality, I don't have much to say about it. It may even be the best film to shoot underwater. You feel like you are under the water with the players. But that's all. This feeling may turn into why I am watching this movie after a while. At least so did I. Of course, everyone has different viewing tastes. If you say I like visuals very much, it gives me great pleasure to watch, watch this movie. You won't find anything other than that."
"I don't know that I can name many movies that can completely and utterly transport me to another world and encapsulate me the way that this movie did. I had my eyes glued to the screen the entire time. Even sometimes when the plot slowed down a bit, I was just stunned by the visuals and trying to take it all in. There was just so much detail to take in - really an incredible triumph and no doubt lots of hard work and diligence from James Cameron and his team.The story was quite simple and straightforward, but done well and despite this being a 3 hour movie, it didn't really feel like it dragged on - the pacing was great. There were some funny moments, as well as some serious moments, I did tear up at a couple occasions and especially the end. I don't really know how James Cameron made me feel like that over some blue CGI aliens, but he pulled it off. Additionally, I thought the music was amazing (RIP James Horner) and worked perfectly to elevate the movie even further (""Becoming One with the People"" is an incredible piece).A definite must watch and possibly the most complete blockbuster movie experience in quite a few years (watch it in IMAX 3D if you get the chance!)."
The story really was all nonsense and a complete bore from the first one. They couldn't come up with any original characters and the theme of the same group of humans coming to steal their land and resources again magically inserted into avatar bodies. Come on! But to make it worse let's just hunt 1 person/family to help accomplish this is ridiculous. We couldn't get out of the theatre fast enough from the boredom of the lack of story line. If I hear the word bro or brah one more time it will be to soon. The 3hrs felt like 5. Please do not waist your money or time and I'm only typing now as it won't let me leave a review without 800 characters.
"Features some of the most incredible spectacle ever created by the absolute master of precise parallel action... The only thing more astonishing than anything in The Way of Water is that Cameron will probably, somehow, top it. Like the first film, Avatar 2 is a flourish of A++ production values and stunning state-of-the-art VFX wrapped around a B-movie action melodrama. It's the epitome of post-content cinema where story comes second to spectacle and appeal to basic emotions. Avatar: The Way of Water is a cinematic spectacle that should be seen on the big screen at least once. Those who loved the original will see their years-long patience rewarded plentifully."
"Years down the line from the first movie, the couple have a family. Can they protect them from what's coming?I was completely ready for this to severely underwhelm me. On the other hand, what I was not prepared for, was how much I loved this. The underwater scenes and a higher frame rate renewed my enthusiasm, and it just might do the same for you.I will grant that it has some issues. It's bloated, with 3 times as many characters as last time. Also, it's overlong, it could easily be half the length. And considering the 13 year wait, and the fact that apparently the script for the fourth one is ""absolutely bonkers"", it is a let down how similar this is to the original: one or more blue people learning the culture of other blue people, with the threat of the RDA led by Quaritch on the horizon.This features a little moderate to strong language and sci-fi violence. I recommend this to any fan of James Cameron. 8/10."
"This movie is an amazing gem and a big surpise for me.The prevailing thought in me throught the movie was - finally! Finally a a great movie, realised with passion.Grand vision, seemingly imposible to realise. It is a wonder that it works. I mean, the movie is weird in a lot of ways if you stop and think about it. Some blue creatures, jumping and running about, but underneath... a believable and based story about family values, about being a father, being a mother. The importance of family life.Something was lost in modern world and this movie sugests a solution, with beautiful visuals and otherwordly feel.It is amazing, it is creative, it evokes emotion, the movie just works, watch it!"
"The eagerly awaited sequel to Avatar (2009) is finally here, and boy it didn't disappoint. Sam Worthington returns to the role of Sully, so does Zoes Saldana and Stephan Lang. The actors get back in there roles quite well, and introducing new characters.Most of the movie feels like a CGI park ride, but at the same time it does have a good story. Most of the actors are basically CGI, for the most part it makes you forget it. The scenery becomes a character itself, and well directed by James Cameron. It is pretty epic, like a Lord of The Rings film, it does takes a while to get to the exciting part, like a slow ride getting to its destination. I like it, but not sure i'd sit through again."
"This long anticipated motion picture is interesting to think about. It is the most technologically sophisticated dinosaur in the world of movies yet. If Oscars still mean anything, and if there still is any justice left on our planet, then ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" should win best VFX, best cinematography, best sound design. Win or be nominated, at the very least.If you watch movies carefully and pay as much attention to detail as you can, and if you've read my review for the first one, then you know there was a slight VFX error in that one. It only occupied a handful of seconds, but it was there, and you cannot change that fact. I'm not saying I saw that error on viewing one because that was more than a decade ago now, but I'm certain I did spot it very early on. I didn't pay attention to it because I was heavily interested in the plot, but then I decided to review the movie, and I couldn't turn a blind eye on that little moment that had been bugging me for all those years of me and ""Avatar"", so I took a closer look and saw what I saw. There it was. I've now seen the sequel. Finally, and I was watching it on that huge screen, and I was paying attention, and I didn't spot anything visually wrong with anything. Thumbs up, for sure, not to mention how the first one was a forest movie, and this one is a different story, it is an ocean movie, but it still has some nice reminders of the forest. Safe to say it is visually even stronger than the first one, absolutely. The sound was also amazing. The only element of the package that is weaker than in the first movie is the music here. It is good, make no mistake, but it does not beat the original score by the now late James Horner. R. I. P.So, the package of this one is as high as possible, probably the highest thus far with the whole underwater motion capture work and everything. But the content is also interesting. In a way, it is the polar opposite to the package. Not in the quality regard, no, the plot is good. You see, the visuals are as new in terms of their production as they get, they are the technologically freshest. But the story here is an old one. Is this basically yet another older film on another planet like many would say ""Avatar"" was basically ""Dances with Wolves""? No, it isn't like that. But the core of the plot is family and how it functions, and this is a very old and familiar topic. A father protecting his wife and their children from peril is what this movie has to offer. This is classics, a dinosaur of a tale. Regardless of how ""sci fi"" this all is, the plot is very understandable and human. By the way, if you haven't seen the first one, I suspect you won't be confused much and you'll probably catch up. Is the second one a copy of the first one? No, it is not, but there are elements that tie the two plots together well, and it should not be hard to figure out who is who and why they are where they are.The characters deserve a special comment. ""The Way of Water"" has a way to bring back some of those that did not survive the first movie. It does not make the most sense, of course, but seeing Quaritch in action again is brilliant. Unless the upcoming movies in this growing franchise take a bad step, Quaritch and Spider will be what Vader and Luke were to the old ""Star Wars"" trilogy. Mark my words. Sigourney Weaver is also back. Her character is gone, for sure, but there are flashbacks, and more, and even though it also raises a question or two, it was done for a reason, and the surface of that reason has been decently scratched here. The plot thread will go on. Unfortunately, there is no way to bring back Trudy, and it would be nice to see her again. Well, not everyone gets to come back. But then, who knows? It isn't easy to do such things without getting carried away and ending up with something ridiculous. So far, everything is alright, and it should stay that way.By the way, what is a character, exactly? Does it have to be a living creature? Does it have to be human? No, because a robot can also be a character in a story. In this movie a whale is a character. A huge underwater life form is a character in a motion picture. It has a history, it has intelligence and kindness, and it shows care for the ones around. And it can fight. The ""Avatar"" franchise isn't what you need if you want interesting characters, you say?! Well, nobody here may be Anton Chigurh or The Joker from Nolan's Batman movie, but the characters here are clear, relatable and interesting nonetheless, and most importantly, the movie is daring and good enough to question what a character even is and proves they don't even need to speak. This is impressive.You know what, the three hour runtime I did not even notice, I didn't get tired of sitting whatsoever. A decent sized chunk of that runtime had me crying for a number of reasons. What got me first was the awe. Then the movie got me thinking about how the beauty I was seeing was fictional, and the real beauty on our real planet is dying now, and that is sad. Finally, when it came to action and violence, the movie really got serious. James Cameron should be nominated as best director once again because he is so good at working with drama in a motion picture. Thank you, Jim."
"Let me first say that I'm a big fan of Mr. Cameron's work. His use of special effects is way ahead of its time, and is forever etched in the memory of the viewer.--
Direction-ish
--
But sadly, even a visionary like Cameron can fall for the usual Hollywood banality, and Avatar2 is nothing but full of cliches, so much so that I found myself saying ""we get it, it's a beautiful sea world, now for God's sake, move on with the story and give the swimming and fishes a break."" Make no mistake, Avatar2 looks stunning and has the telltale Cameron signature, with scenes that invoke memories from the Jaws, Terminator 2, and Titanic. If you watch it, you should definitely watch on the biggest screen available near you. But that's where the good things end. While making the movie a visual masterpiece, Cameron forgot to throw in a story, and it's as if at the last minute he went like ""Oh gosh, we forgot a story, let's just throw in some kids, and some family propaganda, release it in December, and the usual American audience will lap it up along with their Christmas meals.""--
Story-ish
--
Jake Sully is living happily with four kids, which, if you're conscious, is four too many when the world population has just hit 8 billion. He wasn't an officer in the army but he raises his kids with an iron hand acting like a General. The kids just exist, and often make stupid decisions only required to advance the movie. Jake and his wife have occasional loving arguments, but no fights, ever (I want to know which marriage counselor they see), and the wifey and children always fall in line with Jake.There's a character called ""Spider"" or ""the Monkey Boy"", but Cameron forgot to tell him what he was supposed to do, so this dude just dresses like Tarzan and tags along with various people at various times.There's more; the Earth is dying and humans want to establish a colony in Pandora. They decide that the natives must be wiped out. But when Jake flees (because family), the humans, for no reason, decide to forgo their mission and spend the rest of the movie hunting him down.3-star for the visuals."
"My brother still keeps on complaining about the black panther in the woods and the fire looking like plastic and too much cgi while everything else is A-class! I'm telling him it's intentional and this is how it's supposed to look in a world where almost everything but the humans is cgi. It ain't an easy job! The movie is by far the best until now, I like both films, but this one has the emotional touch and the weight of the drama at the end got to me so deeply. Action also is superb!! But the thing that got to me the most was the whale Panayak, was it?? See.. now I have to watch it again...but in true honesty, this movie blows my mind! It's a rewatchable movie. It gets to you in many ways. It's magical, and outstanding. Fun fact tho... where did all the other party that im not gonna say who, went to at the end when it was the most important?? Did they went to grab a snack or eat dinner?! Anyway, that doesn't make the ending terrible not one bit. I'm assuming the focus had to be on them. The Sullys vs the enemy. 10/10 from
Me. I enjoyed it soooo much and you will too. I promise you that!"
"Avatar: Way of the water has a borderline story and fast paced action. Director James Cameron never intended to make it a re-watch, yet it's stunning graphic quality, use of creative ideas and use of the term Reincarnation makes it a swell one time watch. It's return of many characters brings a sense of joy to the audience and makes us eager to watch it. It's CGI is most most of the audience missed as it brought a front view of species infront of us and amazement once again. After almost 13 year wait for this movie... Avatar is still an amazing sequel to its original masterpiece way back in 2009."
"Special effects: 10/10
Story: 5/10
Acting: 7/10Overall 8/10A workmate said that he was asleep for most of this movie. Everyone else I spoke with however, loved it!It starts with a small recap of the previous movie as it has been a number of years since that installment.The special effects are why this movie works. If it had been a story about conflict between human nations, it would be quite ordinary and could be likened to similar events in other movies. However, this definitely is not. It is very beautiful, scenic and visually disturbing with the ugly side of conflict.Aspects to the story are not very original and a little predictable. But are nonetheless done well and carried by the visual effects.Some of the characters are very memorable with notable acting. But being that alot of the cast are young people, you can expect a few scenes to be a little cringe. Plus the accents are a little strange to listen to. But if that was the intention for alien accents, then well done!If you are fascinated by alien worlds with conflict, then this movie is for you! Otherwise, wait for the small screen and watch it at your leisure! It is a long movie and almost feels like a TV mini series back to back.Enjoy!"
"It was truly one of the most Disappointing movies ever, this movie is like a gift which has good covering but when we open it there comes out a middle finger, never expected this movie to be this bad, no story, literally not kept me engaged for a single second. Throughout the movie I was expecting that something will happen for sure but nothing happened, it went flat throughout the movie and for the people rating this movie 10 stars I literally can't believe them , avatar 1 was a very good movie but in front of avatar 2 , avatar 1 is a masterpiece and this is the baddest direction by James Cameron ever, nothing more to say."
"The VFX in Avatar WOW are just stunning. As with the first Avatar, the facial effects on the Navi creatures are just impeccable. Whereas most movies have effects work that you can find in any video game, Avatar sets itself apart by a mile because of the detailed effects work. To build these blue-creatures who flawlessly move and emote, interact with water- they are fully realized beings. The effects of these creatures is just wow.Then you come to the story- boy oh boy- It's far weaker story than the first Avatar. I don't know who the protagonist is supposed to be. Is it Sully, is it his kids, is it the other kid? Whose story is this?It's very scattered and at 3 hour of runtime, they could have easily cut it down to make a more focused story about 1 protagonist.Finally, the 3D- the James Cameron Team and Lightstorm just knows how to make 3D work. Like in the first Avatar, Avatar WOW is really well designed to play as a IMAX 3D experience.This is also truly a movie where you could easily get up to take a pee break whenever and you really wouldn't miss anything. Seriously, this is the one great thing about the movie- you can get up and leave anytime to take a leak or just go do something else. It doesn't need to be 3 hours.The Weak story and the long runtime knocks it down for me. The effects work are worth watching on the biggest 3D screen."
"Was expecting so much more. The original movie was stunning in the visuals, but very compelling characters and story line.The sequel however, relegates. Neytiri to a second tier character, which is mind blowing as the character and the actress were the best thing about the original.This sequel is more about the kids, and they they seem to constantly follow the basic storyline that has been told hundreds of times in hollywood movies, i.e. Kids ignore parents and constantly get into trouble. By the end of the movie i was kind of tired and annoyed by that.Bringing back Langs character is a huge mistake. Given Cameron has talked alot in recent years about movie making, and talking down Marvel movies, you would have thought he could have got some original ideas and/or script going, but alas no. He goes with groundbreaking visuals, but boring seen it all before script.Full marks to Zoe's character and activing (its her voice right ?) that have me the only emotional moment of the movie and made my heart wretch."
"More in the same themes as the first one. It's a strong offering that leaves some new issues unresolved (pretty sure they'll get explored in the next movie or two). I feel the first movie parallels themes of mistreatment of indigenous peoples and the land. This one explores that further, but more so about the harvesting of animals for greed and waste. As someone who recently suffered a significant loss, you should be aware that some of the more intense scenes can be a bit....triggering. I'll definitely watch it again, just at a later date when I'm a bit more emotionally prepared. If you liked the first one, you'll probably like this one."
"After several years of becoming a native Navi and having a family. Jake is confronted by a whole new set of threat. To protect the omaticaya people he must take his family and exode to an ocean tribe but being hunted by humans he must eventually face them. But how will he defeat them?I must admit that I wasn't expecting much from this movie. Maybe that's why my daughter and I were just blown away. What a visual splendour. I thought the 3D effects in the 1st were great but the underwater sequences were just next level. Just astonishing. A visual feast to behold. James Cameron did it again with all the right formulas to make this great. Great character development and a solidly suspenseful and action packed story line. In saying that the real star is the 3D visual effects. This movie just pops! Comedy, action and emotion were on point too. Please see this in 3D at your cinema. It is beautiful!"
"First of all, I am a big fan of Avatar. I was blown away by the CGI back in 2009 and it was a revolution in terms of CGI in movies. Avatar: The way of water did not disappoint as far as that goes. It was phenomenal and probably the most beautiful movie I have ever seen. The details were remarkable, and it felt surreal when experiencing it in 3D.But! Did Cameron forget to spend time on the plot?? It seems like they spend 99 % of the time on CGI and then just reused the plot of Avatar 1.The sky people have returned, and they want to populate the earth. Guess who the main villain is? Colonel Quaritch of course. Again. He resurrects in a new blue version and is determined to get his revenge. His motivation throughout the whole movie is just to track Jake Sully down and kill him no matter what. Is he now immortal? If he dies they might as well just make a new Avatar of him.Once again Jake must learn to adapt to a new way of life, in this case, the reef people. This time with a big family, e.g. Two brothers who are impossible to distinguish between. We are once again introduced to the big resource of the movie, the stuff from the brain of the Tulkun which can stop the ageing process (Unobtanium vol. 2.0.). When the reef people hear about the killings of Tulkuns, they decide to participate in the war against Quaritch and the sky people. They are doing a great job fighting against the people on the boat, but then all of a sudden, the reef people are gone? Suddenly it is only Jake, Neytiri and the kids. Apparently, the reef people just went home, or what? This seems like a huge plot hole since Jake could easily defeat Quaritch and the rest of his men if the reef people had just stayed there and fought?I liked the fighting scene with Jake and Quaritch. Maybe a little long, but it had great suspense. At the end of the fight, they are, as in Avatar 1, rescued by Eywa. Spider is a fun character, but he decides to save Quaritch, even though he had just experienced what a horrible being he is. He then immediately goes to the Sully family and hugs Jake as if he is part of the group once again. This makes NO sense?? If he loves the family so much, why does he save the colonel who had just tried to kill them all? It seems to me that it was hard for the writers to come up with a new villain for the following movie, so they had to keep him alive... Now the big question is: Will he also be the villain of Avatar 4 and 5?So in short, the plot is very similar to Avatar 1, and has quite a few plot holes. However, the visual part of the movie is insane and a must watch in the cinema."
"It is just astonishingly beautiful to watch. It is. Far better than Avatar ""1"", specially the under the sea stuff. Kudos to Cameron for that.*SPOILER ALERT*
But in a time in which sequels are known to be pretty much similar to the original, I can't believe they even reciled the same villain. It sounded so, so lazy! Let's just copy and paste the story but add under the sea + a bit of Titanic to it + loss of family member. Don't get me wrong, I loved watching it, specially on IMAX. I could hardly believe my eyes for how beautiful it all was. But it was really frustrating and felt such like a waste of time and money for me to spend 3 hours with the basically same story on the screen.... Even the hate towards the same human (oops) and the whole manicheism about how the mankind, I mean, sky people are all bad and all want to use all Earth, I mean, Pandora's natural resources. It feels kinda.... Stupid.There are so many ways to show how mankind is overly using Earth's natural resources and making such a binary good vs bad story actually doesn't help at all. People won't reflect about it.Anyway, I'll most likely watch it again just for the visuals. If you want a nice story, though, stick to the 1st. Hope this one doesn't make as much money as the 1st, for I'd hate to pay for visuals again with an even worse story."
"What I don't understand is how a movie of such epic proportions and exorbitant amount of financing, fails so greatly at storytelling.How does this get overlooked?The writing and dialogue are cringe, cringe, cringe.I almost threw up in my mouth a few times.YES, the scenery is beautiful, the special effects are quote unquote out of this world, but who cares? When there is no deep connection between the characters... it gets boring real fast.It was a snooze fest and yes, I had a pricey nap during this screening.SO UNFORTUNATE.Why do big name directors get so lazy or maybe so wrapped up in their big toys?So disappointing.Kate Winslet (Ronal) despite all, was brilliant as always, but I still didn't feel for her or any of the other characters and that is my absolute barometer.Some of the other acting though, cringe. Melodramatic. Disconnected.This was given a 3 just for the visuals."
"Everything just looked similar to the last movie. The CGI, the animations, the dialogue, the action sequences, were all literally copy and pasted from the first movie. There was zero originality. It was clear James Cameron did this for cash because it's not up to his standards. Even Terminator 2, which is widely praised by audiences, wasn't really as good as Terminator 1. It was easy to see T2 was just a rehash of T1 that wasn't as good.This movie didn't really need a sequel. The first ended very well. A sequel would have the humans coming back in force and annihilating the Na'vi. Which happened, but instead of seeing the new human force attack the Na'vi, we basically got a revenge/whale hunt plot. The Quaritch subplot needed to have ended with the last film. He's been reduced to a cartoonish villain. I'm not even kidding. In the first movie, Quaritch was just a company man looking for profit at the expense of the natives. Now he has free reign to go after Jake Sully at the expense of his Earth employers. WUT?We all know James Cameron's obsession with deep sea submersible diving, so it was painful to see him shoehorn this into the Avatar story in an unbelievable way. I don't want to make any spoilers, but at the end of the movie, I was left with a bad taste in my mouth. The writing just wasn't good in this movie.Please wait for streaming. It's not worth watching in theaters. Trust me."
Excellent continuation with few plot holes or mistakes that come with many sequels. The emotional struggle and logistical issues the main characters face are relatable and meaningful. The CGI was excellent allowing you to simply feel immersed in that world and really let your mind go. This has been one of the few movies that has made me want to return to the theater in an age where I can stream almost anything I want on my 65 inch TV in the comfort of my own home. The three plus hour timeframe made sense because this is a long story to present that really needed to not be rushed but rather allowed to organically unravel.
"I have watched the first Avatar many times, and I had a huge anticipation for this one. Honestly I was surprised by how sad it was. In contrast with the first one, which also had its sad moments, but still had quite the upbeat tone and ended up on a victory note, this one is just hard to enjoy fully overall and is quite emotionally draining. Which is not necessarily a bad thing, most modern movies are completely emotionally sterile. I personally am very stoic person, but even I barely held it together by the end. Women around me were wiping tears from their 3d glasses. It was brutal.In regards to the world buildup, the cinematography and the action scenes, as usual James Cameron delivers and overdelivers. I wish there was more in-depth self exploration of the feelings of the main characters, there was very little of the poetic self-observation that Jake Sully goes through in the first movie. Here, the emotions and reactions were mostly basic and primal, in response to what was happening. Too much fear, anger and uncertainty. Also, too little of the wonderful personality of Neytiry, who in this one was pushed too close to her primal instincts and emotions. I think there should've have been more quiet happy moments to contrast the ugliness and the threat coming from the human invasion. We barely saw the life of Jake Sully on Pandora after the first movie. There were some scenes but not enough. Overall, it does feel like the first part of two-part movie. Hope the next one gets released sooner and we don't have to wait years."
"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)""Avatar: The Way of Water clearly sets itself apart from other blockbusters, building on 13 years of preparation to deliver a memorable CINEMA experience by the one and only James Cameron.A visually, technically breathtaking adventure, particularly in the truly stunning underwater sequences. Score (Simon Franglen) remains epic, and the genuine dynamics between the characters of the Sully family lead the viewer to strongly, emotionally invest in them - the performances of the cast, namely Zoe Saldaña, are vital for the film's success.Too bad the recycled, generic narrative doesn't keep up with the creativity, dedication, and innovation levels allocated to the technical elements. Underwhelming to the point of making the three-hour runtime feel heavier than it should, but for fans of the original - which remains supreme - it's far from ruining one of the year's must-see theater experiences.""Rating: B+"
"When the first movie came out, it was hailed as a technical marvel but was criticized for having a pretty cheesy and shallow plot. Well, this movie has both of those attributes dialed up to 11. The visuals, if possible, are even more impressive than those in the first movie. When I say the characters and environments are photo-realistic, that is not an exaggeration. This is one of the most visually impressive movies I've seen. That said, the plot is somehow even MORE bare-bones and cheesy than the first. Again, it's not exaggerating to say that about halfway through, I lost track of what the story was even about. You get so wrapped up in the visuals and the world that it's easy to get lost in it. That is both a good and a bad thing. Characters are, for the most part, pretty one-dimensional, especially the villains, who are about as shallow as you can get. The only exception to the bad guys is Stephen Lang's Quaritch who is a bit more fleshed out than his initial incarnation. The problem is there are so many new characters that it's difficult to give each one their proper due, although to be fair, the movie makes decent use of the time it has. Speaking of time, this movie is LONG. While the first one was long, this one drags on way longer than it needed to. By the end, even with the all the action going on, I found myself saying ""Ok, let's wrap this up!"".A couple other aspects I found refreshing: despite James Cameron's weird comments on ""testosterone"", this movie depicts fathers and fatherhood in a positive light. Also, it doesn't rely on awkwardly-inserted quips to force a laugh out of the audience *cough* MARVEL *cough*, but instead lets the drama unfold on screen. In summary, if you loved the visuals of the first movie, you'll definitely enjoy the ones here. If the lack of a plot from the first ruined it for you, then you might want to avoid this one."
"I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has sleep problem, you can have a great nap during this boring movie, Just to mention it was the first time in my whole life it happened so you can imagine the movie quality. Just the problem was the high sound volume I mean for sleeping. So I gave 3 star to this movie, 2 stars belongs to good visual effects and one star belongs to the great nap that I had during this movie. I think this movie even could be just 1 hour. I remember when I was awake a kid was fooling around with a giant fish for a long time maybe for 20min and a girl was connecting her cable to different creatures. I can not believe how this creative team made this boring movie which didn't have a good storyline and it was a real cliche. But the visual effects was good.Sweet dream 👍🏻"
Sequels can never come close to originals. Magic can be created first time but not again. This time story is too shallow and run time of the movie is unnecessarily long and boring. We have to force ourselves to sit through the movie in expectations of some new exotic content like first part but we were hugely disappointed. There is absolutely nothing new or exciting in movie except nice visuals and wide exotic colour gamut. Would not recommend to spend money on theatrical release. Wait for some time and watch it on OTT platform for a very easily forgatable story. 2nd part afer so many years and that too with such a dull story line is really not acceptable.
"This is a really uneccessary sequel. It's the same old cheesy story of ""Good nature people living in paradise under attack from evil sadistic colonialists"". There's nothing new, nothing surprising, the movie is predictable from beginning to end. If you know the first one, you know this one too. The biggest problem is that the simple story is stretched to 3 hours! I felt bored a lot and was glad when the movie was finally over.A lot of the reviews here argue ""Well, the story is boring but the visuals made up for it"". To be honest, I wasn't blown away by the visuals either. Most of the movie looks computer animated, like a video game. Nice yeah, but it really doesn't look like there's a 13 years difference to the first Avatar. It's not as stunning as back then.I definitely won't watch a third Avatar. To me, the first Avatar was stunning for the time back then, but the second one was an uneccessary sequel to print some money.I can't believe it has an IMBD rating of 7.8.When you look at the written reviews, the average rating is definitely lower, closer to 5 to 6."
"I used to confess being Mr. Cameron's biggest fan. That sentiment ended with Way Of Water. What a way to water down a good story. This latest installment of Avatar reminds of those poor sequels that followed after Terminator 1 & 2. Not sure if Mr. Cameron actually took part in this movie's production. One thing I am sure of is that it is missing that James Cameron touch that we have all fell in love with over the years. There is no thought provoking dialogue, some of the decisions made by the villains are completely unrealistic, the scenes and dilogue are disjointed. The ending is Titanic remade. Infact the whole movie is just a remake of the 1st one but with a maritime perspective. Some characters like the stupid boy Spider are completely stupid. The spirituality of the 1st installment has been replaced by cursing & urban gesturing. The father some relationships don't make sense. I could go on & on but the bottom line is this movie is a big disappointment & not worthy wasting time & money over."
"I saw the first Avatar in 3d and what a ride! Saw this one in 2d and while visually stunning, it didn't have the same impact without 3d.When I saw the first Avatar my initial reaction was, No, this isn't realistic, greedy corporations wouldn't be so ruthless, and then I thought about it, and unfortunately the depiction is probably not that far off from what the world has seen from military backed commercial interests. But I still didn't want to see that kind of violence on these beautiful people and their world. But even with these criticisms of the original, the total package still got an 8/10 from me.This one is a repeat of the first film, so even with the stunning visuals it's a 5 or 6/10. Even the evil, jacked up military leader is the same exact guy! The only thing that has changed is the scope of ambition, this time they want to colonize the whole freaking planet for humans who've messed up their world. And while many love the realistic violence, I've gotten really tired of seeing people slaughter each other and the environment, though to be honest, showing the battle between technology and these water people was pretty unique.But still, is portraying this kind of good against evil the only story to be told with a budget in the 100s of million dollars and a subject matter that is beyond stunning? Knowing what I know now, I definitely wouldn't have gone to see it in 2d. In 3d it'd be worth it for me to put up with this outworn trope of a story just to see this gorgeous world they created."
"James Cameron is easily the most ambitious film maker in the business with the knowledge and credibility to do literally whatever he wants. Nowhere is this more evident than the mammoth Avatar sequel. He pulls off yet another visually stunning film that feels real, but the indulgence of the studio and no one to say no to him create some unfortunate flaws.The humans are almost universally cartoonishly evil. When they come back to Pandora, their ships essentially nuke a majority of the setting of the last film. They cruelly hunt whale analogues, specifically hunting females with calfs, all while knowing explicitly that they are intelligent, emotional alien species.Cameron's biggest issue though is the cast. There are about 10 or so main characters in this movie, and Cameron tries to give all but two a complete, separate, story arc of their own. Several times it feels like 3 movies were actually spliced and intercut together because there are so many threads being handled at the same time, but to his credit, they all come together exceptionally well in the climax and are all fairly satisfyingly and efficiently resolved.So while it is fashionable to hate on everything that anyone ambitious tries to do right now, and try and root for everything popular to fail, I think Way of Water is a very interesting experience which should be seen in 3D at the theatre as the director intended. Because, while the film is by no means perfect, when someone tells you they built their own rocket to Mars in the back yard, people should gather to watch the launch because succeed or fail, it is going to be worth the price of admission."
I have been waiting for a long time for this movie to release. But it failed to entertain. Story isn't good enough for the high expectations. It is creating stress instead of entertainment. Story shows the hard truth of mankind having no humanity. I am sure the next sequels will create more stress on our minds. Story and Narration failed the movie. 2 nd part of this movie will be completely war. Too much to take outside world and in movies. It is all about wars. The expectation of Avatar is entertainment. It doesn't need to keep showing the hard truth. I felt my time and money are not justified.
"Due to COVID I have not been to the Cinema since that thing turned the World on it's head, but I always thought that any Avatar sequels would get me back in and it did. I have seen quite a few sniffy reviews but pretty much ignored them preferring to judge myself the merits or otherwise. It was pretty much what I expected basically carrying on in the same vein as before.....and I had absolutely no problem with that,I was engrossed from start to finish, there was always something to marvel at,on screen. The kids,I thought were great providing numerous 'Newt' moments,(..Cameron fans will know what I mean..),and although the eco messaging was admittedly quite heavy handed any objective observer would have to agree with it...humans have been and continue to be so incredibly destructive to the Natural World. For me,it was stupendous fantastical fun and I cannot wait for the next one. This is one Pandora's Box I'm very glad was opened."
"The first Avatar had a really weak story. One we already seen a dozen time. It is pochahontas, Danse with wolves or every outcast trying to integrate tribal people while his kind, the evil civilized white want to exterminate them and extract ressources or conquer the lands.Despite that, James Cameron give us a spectacular cinematographic experience. The music, the world building, the culture. Every little details are tought of to completely immerse the audience into Pandora... The story telling is pretty straight forward, we see things coming a mile away. But we are riding along like hypnotized by the world created for Us.12 years later, Cameron did it again. Very predictable script, but it manage to get us enjoy the 3h30 ride and beeing in Awe toward this incredible spectacle. It is more about Jake Sully 'family' this time and once again, they are outcast in a new tribe trying to learn new ways. This add a whole new dimension to this world. By the end, we have a glimpse of what Cameron will be undertaking for the next 4 movies. And if he is doing this right, this could easily become one of the biggest franchise ever. I dont doubt Cameron capacity to take us where he want to go. This director know how to tell a story, even if it is one we have heard before. He is that good.We shall wait and see.I, for one, was glad to come back to Pandora."
"The front part of the movie skips some beats and notes, but once the characters get to where they are going, it smoother sailing. I highly recommend watching it in the theater as there are just so many details in the movie that are stunning. The change of location seemed unnecessary as it's being presented in the movie, but honestly it took the movie in its own needed direction. Part of me wishes they didn't bring back the humans and let us just enjoy the world of Pandora more because the non-action sections were so immersive. It was definitely a long movie, but didn't feel as long as it was and I managed to stay keep focused on the movie even with my ADHD."
"I loved the 1st film and I've just come out of the cinema watching the 2nd film. I am heartbroken and sad because the story has so many plot conveniences and doesn't really go anywhere. There isn't really anything at stake, the plot was written by a beginner and has no depth.At least the visuals were good, but this is just once again proof that if the story is empty so will your memory be of this film. Come on Cameron you could have done better !I don't wish to go into details but this film follows the Hollywood garbage strategy to recycle and remake, such a shame for this film and that Cameron had to go down this path.The film doesn't have the tension or the depth of the wonder of the 1st film. Only the visuals are on par.Extremely disappointed by this experience overall. I do not recommend paying to watch this in a cinema."
"I wanted to love a movie that was a sequel to Avatar. Instead, because I didn't drive my own car to the theatre, I had to suffer through an air thin script, way too much ""bad guy"" senseless violence, and the Achilles Heel of any parent: someone threatening to torture and kill all your children, multiple times. Happy Friday, James Cameron!When I think of other ways this movie budget could have been used to uplift society, I feel a deep sense of loss for your decisions. Mostly, I'm left disturbed that I spent three precious hours of my life watching such a disappointing, disgracefully violent movie.I'm sure there will be people who rave, but our failing educational system might be the culprit for the glowing reviews.A total bummer, only go if you are in need of self induced torture."
"I'm going to start off by saying the film looked great. And the action sequences are amazing. Really cool and good tense moments that put you on the edge of your seat or mentally go ""he** yeah! Give it to em!"" My only issue is I wish there was more of these moments for the length that the film is.Now onward to the not so good... they resurrected the antagonist from the last avatar... they put in cheesy predictable cliches... the story, the inspiration, is the same. Only instead of minerals it's ""earth is dying and we're moving here"" and ""alien whale brain juice is anti aging"" so basically ambergris, whaling, and the destruction of nature by modern man... all familiar topics from the first film.The movie has a ton of character building and drama. But for very little depth. Jake has devolved into a semi pig headed father type, who doesn't really listen to his kids. Neytiri spends most of the film, screaming, being angry, hissing and kinda going savage mode. The film is largely centred around their naive kids, and the things they get into, fighting, growing up, learning they have some kind of super connection with aywah, it's kind like watching a high school show without the highschool.I think this boils down to bad writing. Bad/forced story progression. Your not watching the next iteration of avatar so much as your watch a rehashed version of it with more ocean now. But don't get me wrong it's pretty.It just left a whistling hole in me where the first avatar was... which I guess I'll go watch that one because it feels more genuine."
"I can't believe this garbage movie made over.$2 BILLION. 3 HOURS waste of time. This movie was utterly garbage. I couldnt remember their names and understand the story. . But hey I guess Gen Z and Millennials love to jump on the bandwagon and hype the most overrated movies.THIS MOVIE SUCKS. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME. This deserves a -1/10. However the visuals effects was the only good thing in the movie. I have no words. Never going to watch avatar. Lets bring this down to a 6 :). There was so much going on which makes you go wtf and what were those cringe graphics. It was just a little inappropriate and very weird. STRAIGHT TRASH, CRINGY. AND WEIRD DIALOGUES."
"Where those 10+ years went for producing this movie? Amount of plotholes and terrible script is through the roof in this movie. From quite alright movie where we got scientists trying to make peace and corporation trying to mine. First one they didn't had idea how to make new villan so they used worst possible thing and they cloned last villan somehow. In that few years they took to get back to Pandora they advanced technology more than in last few decades! So they don't want to mine super valuable rocks anymore they are here to kill Jake Sully for some weird reason and they want to destroy this planet to even through they want to move all people here now? I'll skip ahead few plotholes to talk about the rest. How did they knew that brain of a whale is a infine life serum? It would require many many years of studying but they were on a planet for a year. Its also worth only 80mln which is nothing compared to the rock they mined previously so why they do it? Another one, how did helicopter from navi people 400km from original forest to water islands in few min just to save Jake's daughter? It was added just so the bad guys could find them. Im done writing it because I would waste 3 h to write them all."
"I like Avatar 2 better than the first one. Where to begin?First of all, the visuals are the best I've seen, period. The crystal clear, crisp footage is unlike any other film.Second, getting to know the entire family was great. Because it's a long movie, we get a chance to really get to know each kid. They're awesome.Third, this movie communicate so many perennial values. Family, compassion, humility, courage, etc. It's rare nowadays.Fourth, the nature is beyond spectacular. Better than the first. It's worth watching for that reason alone.Is it long? Yes. But because it's so good, it never gets boring. So, what are you waiting for? Go see it in the movie theater."
"Well that was a first. I was actually bored and checking my watch at the movie theater. Definitely never had that happen for a movie I had paid over $40 for a pair of tickets for.Let's just say if you enjoy watching computer screen savers it is the film for you. 1.5+ hours of screen saver and maybe 1.5 of actual movie. Then the 1.5 hours of actual movie is poorly written, mediocre storytelling that leaves so many open threads, while still only being repeats of previously made movies. Can we say Transformers,Titanic, and any movie of native Island people? It was bad enough the first movie was a direct ripoff of the storyline from Pocahontas with just special effects and explosions added in. The theme here seems to have been let me smash every Michael Bay & James Cameron film into one and then put every special effect technology available to us and ton of explosions to make something crazy to look at then go back and try to add some story. The result was a 3+ hour pretty snooze fest that a good editor should have cut to 1.5."
"...and that's about it, nothing else!Avatar 2 has... no script/story at all. Seriously! The film is almost 3 hrs long and looks to me like Camaron somehow... went to ""Pandora"" planet and shot an incredible... DOCUMENTARY!No, really! It's like... ""National Geographic: Planet Earth""! This film here is ""J. Cameron: Planet Pandora""!There is NO script, no story!In the first Avatar, we had a ""sci-fi"" space version of ""Pocahontas"". Cameron simply copied the Pocahontas' story and he made it ""scient fiction"" with INCREDIBLE visuals (CGI)! But okay, I loved Pocahontas fairy tail, I didn't care about it....But the problem is, the Avatar 2 didn't have a story AT ALL. The film is simply a COPY-PASTE of the original Avatar, without so much details (as the original story), very similar, simply now the story is not in the big forest but in the ocean.INCREDIBLE CGIs... breath-taking, you can't understand/feel that these are NOT REAL but made with computer! Seriously, AMAZING visuals!...And that's all, no story at all.I SUPER INJOYED the film, no question about it. But like I said is like A DOCUMENTARY, not a film. Almost the 2/3 of the (3 hrs) film are simply documentary, with amazing visual - you don't follow any story, any plot, nothing.I super like it... but is not a film, is a VISUAL CGI SHOWCASE of what modern technology can create in our days!"
"So much money was made with the first part. So much time was available for the second part. What came out An extremely stupid family protection revenge plot. Hard to bear for more than three hours. The film music at the cheapest series level. Hollywood is down. Would have liked to throw up in my popcorn. Can Hollywood really only do unimaginative sequels that are only based on profit expectations? Where are the ambitious attempts of the 60s and 70s. In this way they will kill the cinema. I'm so down Only effects and action dull over time. The first part had such good innovative ideas, also in the plot. I'll see the third one at home.."
"The much anticipated sequel to Avatar succeeded whole-heartidly in the visuals department. It features a lot of familiar faces which you'll definitely recognize.The script is by far weakest point of the movie. The plot itself is very predictable and some things just outright do not make sense when put together. They definitely could have done a better job putting things together.If you watched the first one you'll recognize plenty of references to the first film - and as such I recommend you do watch that one first, otherwise this one is quite difficult to follow.Overall it's worth a watch, especially if you like the first one."
"I've walked in the Cinemax Premium Hall with the same expectations I did when the new Top Gun came out. My expectations were far from being met. The 3D post processing looked like a mixture of scenes containing either 24p or 60hz and moments with high interpolation (the soap opera effect). Also it looked like a mixture of animation scenes and video game scenes with obvious transition from one scene to another. I still don't know how to digest the experience. Secondly, it was way too long for what it wanted to tell. I have no problem watching an immersive long movie. But this one made me impatient more than once. It really felt stretched intentionally and obviously more than once. I've walked in with high cinematic, visual expectations and low expectations for the script. But boy was this one going to surprise me. I rarely feel like I wasted my time with a movie. With this one, I feel double-crossed. I don't want my money back, only because I got the chance to warn others. I can understand why they didn't want to disclose the budget. You would feel tricked if they did. Maybe the 2D would look better, I don't know. But it's a stretch anyways."
What a manual and steps to survive on Pandora. We learned to live in jungle and now in the water. We have got introductions with major flora and fauna of Pandora.So many questions left unanswered. 2 hours of family drama and whole of the Pandora sepaking in English. People on Pandora are primitive and yet so much advanced.Old villain reenters as though no one else can play a villain or the bad guy. Same old people with forced charcters as though someone needs a promotion so a designation is created.The thing appreciable is computer graphics animations and VFX effects. I was excited for this installment but it has left me high and dry for the next one it is happens.
"But the worst damn thing of all is the premise of the whole movie. It's not that the humans have come back, not really. It's not even that they're hunting whales en masse. Nono, even Sulky says ""they're hunting me, not those way-superior-than-me whales who have discovered mathematics and philosophical thought.""Why Sully, why do you think you are important? Why is this random, slightly above average warrior so important? And why does he flee from the forest? Obviously the general will just follow him there, thus Sully knowingly brings the general from the sea-people. It took all the way to the end for Jake Sully to come to his epic realization that he should focus on not fleeing, which means, I suppose, continuing the Gerilla warfare that he was already doing. Why the f- did he stop with that?And the general, why on earth does he have such a big budget for his completely pointless plan of vengeance, with the support of everyone in his surrounding? His superior literally says that she has a more important mission, which is the continual exploitation of the whole planet. Yet I'm scene after scene she is shown to aid the General in his pointless pursuit for Jake Sully, unquestioningly.And the whale fleet. These whales literally stop aging. The elixir they produce within their bodies is the most valuable thing in the world. Yet the general, for his completely meaningless vendetta, has the authority to not only take over the ship (literally just threatens the captain with violence) but also antagonize the sea-people in such an extreme way that they risk causing an uprising, thus threatening their whale-hunt (literally the main reason why they are at that planet)?What is the point with the general? Why are his soldiers following him? Why does no one question this mission? It's so dumb that I was waiting for an explanation of why they were hunting him for such a long time. Like what, he knows the infrastructure of humans better? He knows how to bomb things better? He shoots a gun?And why wouldn't his first thought be, when he moves to the sea-people, that he's just bringing the general to them?Oh it was so bad. So so bad."
"It is literally the same story but in water... why bother? Visually, it looks like a very good and a very very long computer game intro... Story-vise extremely dull, predictable and sorry to say but boring... Cameron knows how to press the emotion buttons and that's it... they should make a Disney+ series out of it and not a 3 hours long movie... obviously people don't want complicated stories or good dialogue cause that movie doesn't offer it and still made almost 2 billion... What a world we live in... I would say I am disappointed but I didn't expect much to begin with... First movie was already very dull and boring story-vise but at least it was visually first of its kind and it was worth watching but the second one doesn't even have that pioneer effect it is just milking the cash cow instead of telling a good story."
"It's visually stunning but there is no substance. Cameron may have been able to pull this trick once when the technology had never been seen before but the CGI although impressive is not as ground breaking as it was 13 years ago. People are over 3d now. It's a one trick pony, a decade too late. Like with the first, a movie that comes in near 3 hours needs more than great CGI to sustain it. Without any kind of engaging plot it's three hour run time feels like an eternity.Why doesn't plot seem to matter to anyone anymore? Are we really so dumbed down as a society?Movie's that cost so much really need more to make it. After the initial buzz, I suspect viewings will crash and nobody will care in a very short period of time."
"While watching the movie we involved in story that much as we think we are also na'vi, and when humans attacked by animals and the whole theatre whistling and celebrating the defeat of humans, that's the reality of emotions... Nature is the mother for all, we need to take care of it for our future generations to live, great idea and a moral message to mankind via avatar, making super thanks to the whole team to making a morality in to a good movie..good work awesome sounds nice characters and the winner is story and the way the team makes it perfect, and waiting for sequel may be 2 years or more."
"Seems like the same story, same cast, same outstanding effects, but nothing really new except the 'remake' is in the water! There is no really good explanation of how the antagonists are all in avatar Na'vi bodies, or, how the sea people can communicate with sea creatures, among other plot holes. The sequence where Sully and family 'learn' how to travel on sea 'dragons' is almost identical to how Sully had to learn how to fly with the flying creatures in the first edition of this film. It is a shame that we had to wait thirteen years for the next chapter and after three plus hours. I can honestly say that I do not think it was worth the wait."
I was hooked from the start of this movie. Saw it IMAX 3D. Plot scale feels smaller than the first one but in a good way. It focus is on family and the emotional connection between living things. This is a movie that lets you leave this planner for 3 hours and completely forget you're watching a movie. It's been awhile since I've seen a movie that I snap back to reality when the credits start. The cgi is still mind blowing and so realistic . The actors were all amazing and did a wonderful job. I don't think there was a thing I disliked about this movie. Even the run time was not an issue. 10/10 would highly recommend.
"The first Avatar was also the first movie I watched in 3D....at that time it was quite underwhelming, the colours were faded.... I enjoyed it more watching it at home. That being said, not only did I find the sequel much more involving with a better story (ok, some times you do need to shut off your brain and just sit in awe of the pictures presented to you)....and watching it in Imax 3D combined with HFR (High Frame Rate) it was a spectacle....the fast moving characters are not flawless yet....but in the whole it was an experience compared to my first 4DX movie....but naturally on another gradient of enjoyment....while (eg) Top Gun was great for a 4DX experience (getting air in your seat was awesome), this was perfect in Imax 3D.... My buddy almost forced me to go, while I did not see the point...but boy, do I see the point now!"
"Avatar: The Way of Water, also known as Avatar 2, is the long-awaited sequel to 2009's technical marvel; now thirteen years later Avatar 2 is FINALLY here, but does it live up to the hype? I think the world is gonna be divided into TWO firmly-defined camps when it comes to Avatar 2: HELLA-YES, or HELLA-NO! This film is definitely gonna be a firm talking point of 2022's sporadic year at the cinema, what with films like Top Gun 2 and The Batman being high-points, but so many duds like Black Adam and Strange World also weighing the year's slate down with... the sheer bulk of delayed releases alone.Avatar 2 continues the first movie's exploration of Pandora, and its got more time to spare (which some of the film's water-scenes could have been trimmed to accommodate a more forgiving runtime) what with this being shot back-to-back with Avatar 3 and 4 (and maybe even some of Avatar 5(and/or 6 too?)?) over the course of half a decade and then some. Clearly this film was no easy breezy task to tackle: and considering these movies cost a collective $1-billion + to make, it's gotta make nigh-HERCULEAN box office returns to justify its existence alone.Anywho, is the story any good, are the characters likeable and is the music good? The answer is yes to all those things, though the screenplay could certainly be stronger next time; the story has more elements of Disney's 1999 Tarzan (at least for me it did) than just straight up FernGully/Pocahontas like the first one. But the Na'vi cultures and characters have more development than the previous film, and it's pretty clear this film is expanding Avatar's Universe significantly. And the music, though somewhat weak at parts, still evokes James Horner's grandiose in spite of his unfortunate 2015-passing. The direction makes you wish James Cameron would do another Alien film, or even direct a Star Wars film with a Lawrence-Kasdan-penned screenplay; but Avatar 2 shows the man's still got a sensibility for cinematic flare and scale.Though the film's certainly not perfect, it's far from fatally flawed either; though if the FOLLOWING sequels have more or less the same structure of story and character-beats we might be in big trouble. For a Part-Two to a long-awaited movie, there's certainly been worse: and the visual effects are of course better than the first movie's effects. There could have been some trimming of what I'll call the 'fish-bonding scenes', but aside from some minor pacing issues, Avatar 2 is ample entertainment for those of us wanting an investing Space Opera (more like Planet Opera) to escape to in these unpredictable times. Plus the whole 'DNA factor' to the story was a refreshingly creative touch and was deeper than the first one's approach).Avatar 2 is a visually stimulating experience that might not be the most demanding story in cinema history, but it's a space-fantasy that gets its job done without being downright hokey or boring. Here's hoping Avatar 3 gets ever crazier/riskier with what's in the pipeline already.4/5 stars. Avatar 2 is perfectly imperfect, and hopefully the world-building will get even deeper next time."
"I loved the first movie 13 years ago with the eye popping 3D effects and I love the 2nd movie for the same reason. As others have stated that some of the basics of the second movie is similar to the first. But with this one we get a whole new eye popping world to fall in love with and enjoy. It is enjoyable, family oriented, action, drama, and will pull all your emotions out by the end. It will leave you with questions that will hopefully be answered by the end of the fifth movie. I cannot wait to see all five in 3D and even hope to own the others once they come out to blue ray or dvd. My brother and me if I was (blubbering) at the end of the movie. Of course I was and I'm woman enough to admit it. But from the sound of the theater, I wasn't the only one being emotional. Just go and see it and enjoy the heck out of it!"
"Dimension 1- visuals. Blows every other Hollywood blockbuster out of the water. Pun intended! I would only watch this movie in 3D. The world comes to life. I never got tired of the crystal aqua sea. It served as the perfect virtual vacation for a winter movie release.Dimension 2- story and drama. Classic storylines of man vs nature. Explorers vs natives. Greed vs good. Family vs faction. Action sequences effectively utilize the stunning environments, and the story was strong enough I didn't yawn once the entire 190 minutes.Dimension 3- characters and dialogue. Considering all the characters are tall and blue, it's hard to create a cast with vastly diverse appearances and personalities. But the characters have enough personality to keep it interesting and support the story."
"After years of waiting it's finally here!Just watched it on IMAX 3d and it was mind blowing!Let's just say I was extremely hyped and saw millions of videos before and it still lived up to the hype.First of all- the pacing was great! A 3 hour+ movie definitely scares a lot of people (not me I can watch hours and hours of pandora) but you don't feel that it's 3 hours cause you're just immersed in the world! I looked at my phone once throughout the movie and it was after 3 hours and I couldn't believe it.The story as everyone says, is simple but not in a bad way, and there are several twists and turns. Sometimes things were similar to the first Avatar and sometimes not.I loved the new characters especially To'ak but I feel like I was missing jake and neytiri sometimes.Also, The performances were amazing across the board (maybe a couple exceptions but mostly great)The visuals were out of this world (literally) and even just thinking about it I want to visit the world a second time next week.Oh and let's just say there are a lot of James Cameron Easter eggs scatters around which is fun.Anyways loved it and can't wait to watch it again! Definitely recommend- go see it!!!"
"Fresh off watching avatar 2: the way of water, and I must say.. visually it is another masterpiece.I've never seen such amazing vfx whenever water was on screen. I had multiple moments where I questioned if this was real or totally vfx.As expected it is a monster in the box office! And again the visual effects are among the best in any movie. Can even say they beat the first avatar in that regard.Definitely the length is a topic of conversation as it should be but I mean.. would James Cameron do any less? Lol.An amazing sequel in the franchise and if 3 is already wrapped then I for one cannot wait the 2 years to see the next one!James Cameron you've done it again!! 🤙"
"Visually spectacular, but my goodness, does it drag.It's a 1hr 50 minute film, crammed into a runtime of a little over three hours. My goodness me.The whole film can be summed up with 'humans bad, do the bad things'. Yes, from the Point of view of Pandora, correct. That's it really.We only get hints at how Earth is.... And the resources for interplanetary missions... yet Pandora is the sole option? At least 'unobtainium' is not the macguffin, but it has suddenly jumped to the alien whale brain-juice (at 80 million a vial, that'll pay for the interplanetary missions, multi-ship missions, in no time flat). It's just stupid. Double down on the 'humans need pandora for survival of the species' - don't have that as the throwaway line and then make it about whale brain juice.Gah! Such an annoying film."
"With ""Avatar: The Way of Water"", James Cameron manages to make a leap in overall quality from a fist episode (Avatar) to the second (The Way of the water) equivalent, even arguably superior, to what Georges Lucas achieved with ""The Empire Strikes Back"" from ""Star Wars"".While I was skeptic about the use of 3D in the first movie, I must say that now its working really well. The initial rendering of 3D on screen was so that I never felt that it failed to mimic ably the perception of depth. In fact in the first Avatar; I often had the feeling that what was seeing on the screen was the juxtaposition of several flat planes one after the other. The technology at the time did not allow depth to be continuous and progressive. I therefore hesitated when purchasing my ticket to Avatar 2 to opt out of 3D and go for a good old 2D screening. Well I would have been wrong. 3D does work in this instance absolutely stunningly. The only quirk is that it darkens the image and thereby dimming down the colors, which in the Avatar's universe are a source of amazement.Progress was made on the VFX as well. There were some brief and rare moments within scenes in the first arc when Na'vis, Pandora's floras and faunas or human machines felt unreal. None of this occurs in ""The way of the water"". All feels real and at no point did my gaze spot an instance on the screen that revealed the computer generated nature of what was shown.Story wise, ""Avatar : TWOW"" builds on all the traits that we know make great entertainment. This is the reason why I do not give the movie a perfect 10. The script is build around themes that have been proven to work effectively in fiction, time and again across centuries. So you can't really be surprised here. You won't experience a ""wow, I did not see that coming"" as Darth Vador revealing he's the father. However storytelling and dialogs are really handled to perfection to the point where, while the movie lasts 3 hours, I ended up wanting it to last twice as much.It is a family story with all the inner workings of a family : love, misunderstanding, longing, aggravation...It is also a coming of age story as well as a reinventing oneself story and a good vs. Evil story. So as I said earlier James Cameron really throws at us all the tropes of successful fictions of the past. But he and his writer team managed to commingle them magnificently and it works out !I think that where James Cameron does a better work than Georges Lucas on Star Wars is in building a word that feels at the same time coherent and complex. One of my main issue with SW is that Lucas had the tendency to throw species or strange devices on the screen without ever pausing to reflect on whether it was coherent within the universe he was building as long as it was fun. The pink elephant playing drums in Jabba's lair is a perfect illustration of this fun vs coherence choice. In Avatar's world everything makes perfect sense within the whole ecosystem depicted. Even the human machines are well thought of on top of being a spectacle by themselves.All in all Pandora remains visually breathtaking and engaging. Watching the movie, it really feels as if we are embarking on an exploration of a far away world that is stunningly beautiful.There isn't much to say about the acting apart from stating that It's really flawless. There isn't one moment where I ended up thinking that it was acting or that the characters on the screen were 3D computer generated constructs.All in all so a spectacular and entertaining experience that I enjoyed tremendously."
"Visually, CGI stunning; plot wise, wakey-wokey. Overly long by a full hour; pretentious in setting. As with most if not all sequels, the original was better, but that isn't saying much as the first version was just like this; ""second verse, same as the first"". If you saw the first version, then you've already seen everything you need to know about this one. Yes, I'm repeating myself as there isn't any reason to go see this one, much less for it to even exist. If you want to sleep for three hours in a comfy chair, stay home where you can get your own snacks without having to pay an arm and a leg. Have I made my self clear; AVOID LIKE THE COVID PLAGUE."
"The Avatar franchise was forged out of James Cameron's desire to create new cinematic technology while simultaneously raising awareness for the causes he believes in so feverishly. Among these causes are his convictions that movies yearn to be seen in large formats and that society must consider its impact on nature. Cameron's ability to convey these topics in a way that's appealing to mass audiences is what's always made him a revolutionary filmmaker. But the balance between striking visuals and an engaging story was skewed in Avatar: The Way of Water, which hindered my investment in the characters and rendered the supposed emotive moments unsuccessful. The pure spectacle of the film can't be undersold, but that alone failed to hold my undivided attention for the full 3 hour and 12 minute runtime. I'm an advocate for any movie that can draw audiences out of their homes and into the theaters, but next time I'd prefer it not be reminiscent of an egregiously long video game cutscene."
"The last movie I went to see in the cinema was Dune and that was incredible. I had similarly high expectations for the new Avatar considering the director has gone vegan and it seemed his heart is in the right place.But this movie is terrible. And I recommend you save your money. I live in Finland and it cost EUR 17,40 for the matinee showing at 12:45. I was sitting at home contemplating whether to go see it or not since it was pretty cold outside, almost -16.Well I should've stayed home.There is no plot resembling anything of substance. There is zero percent humor except a flying arm late in the film that got one lonely gag out of one of the few people in the theatre, me.I kept checking the time on my ipod nano and hoping it would end already after about 20 minutes into the film. I did breathing exercises and practiced mindfulness during the movie to help cope with the annoyance of having paid for an incredibly pretentious and boring film (with a budget that could feed a third world country).Great art has to be surprising. Gimme something. Even the score is extremely dull and predictable. Such visuals would perhaps go with a more futuristic soundscape and why not throw in some absurd dance or sex scenes in the middle of the film. Nope. Nothing. This is hollywood woke familly friendly all the way but with a lot of violence and killing white people.Of course.I couldn't make it to 3 hours. I put on my winter gear, left the 3d glasses on the adjacent seat and walked out. I wanted to make sure the gods understood my disatisfaction in the hopes of attracting higher quality content into my version of the dreamworld.Now back home, drinking beer, contemplating the vicissitudes of life (this year has been a weird one) and writing this review.If this is what you have been up to James for the last 15 years or whenever the first Avatar was released, your integrity as a film maker has seriously been compromised.Thanks for reading."
"Ok Human race which has interstellar ships and everything gets stomped by wooden arrow barbarian archers? Yeeah. Humans lost the war 20 years ago by barbarian archers and still can't implement arrow proof glass helicopters? Yeeah. Interstellar technology and you can't belt humans in robots with some steel? Yeaah. One barbarian barehand family destroys all human army? Yeaah.If you are stupid teenage girl you will probably love this movie, but if you are not than yea, get ready for brainless scenes and a lots of it.Effects, production and graphics overall are magnificent and without this Hollywood is non-existent, this Hollywood new movie directors are schooled to be that bad at their jobs. Meh..."
"Family, friendship, support, rejection, motherhood, fatherhood and unity. When I say these words and you know its about a movie you might scuff and think ""Wow, its not like there have been a million movies about these topics"" ironically and you would be right. But in the end, these topics are very important, its just that we are saturated with them that we can't feel the taste of the emotions from these topics/feelings.The production, effects, acting and the storytelling in Avatar 2 makes you feel and relive those topics and emotions in its full once again. The story is not new, its not terribly unique at all but it tells a many times told story in a way that makes the viewer remember how important and beautiful these things actually are."
"The Story Sucks. This Movie could have been Epic.This movie is made for Teenage Kids dealing with Daddy issues.This movie was not meant for Adults.1. The focused too much time on developing the character for the son, and they left everyone else out.2. They spent too much time on the son swimming with the whale.3. They didn't spend enough time on the Dad.4. They should have had an Epic fight which included both the Forest and Water Tribes, that resemble the Avengers movies.5. There wasn't enough a variety of Characters like the first movie.6. This movie is about ONE Family versus an Army Platoon.7. They could have made the ending fight scene a lot better.8. I hate movies and shows that reuses the same Villain over and over again. You need to have a New Villain in every movie."
"For years I've been thinking nothing could surprise me of entertainment, movies or tvs shows, until I watched avatar 2. I thought the first avatar was average so I wasn't expecting much from this. But this movie completely blew my mind away. This is a perfect movie for a cinematic experience. If your a cinema fan this is a must see for you. Some people are trashing the story, I'd say its a perfect balance and James Cameron has put all together with perfection. The visuals are a whole nother level. I watched it in 3d and I'm ready to watch it again in 3d isense next week. Who ever said never under estimate James Cameron, they are absolutely right. I'll be very shocked if this movie flops at the box office cause I think this movie can't flop. Everyone will love this movie for sure, and it's a movie that people will watch keep coming back to the cinema for. This is a masterpiece and a visual monster."
"I really wanted to love this movie, but there are just so many flaws, that can't be overlooked in my opinion.First of all, the whole story is super thin and basically there are no major plot points. It all feels like a big filler movie to an upcoming third movie. The motivation of the antagonist is really state of the art and super cliche. There are a lot of scenes that are way too long and do not bring the story any further. There were a few moments in the cinema, where I wished that the scene is finally over.When I try to remember the highlights of the movie, there isn't any particular moment to name. (My biggest highlight was the mission impossible exclusive look before the movie, which was ironically way more memorable as any scene of Avatar 2)The characters are super boring and I wasn't really interested in one of them. Till the end you really even can't differentiate between the two sons, because they basically have the same look and Character. It tries too hard to be emotional, but fails to succeed, because of the lack of care for the protagonists.Effect wise there are a lot of pretty moments but also a lot of super ugly 3d Videogame, bad physics moments that really destroyed the moment. It's just not consistent. If you compare it to lasts years Dune, in which everything is a super consistent and polished world, you realize that there are big differences between those two movies in terms of world building and set design. But there are indeed some really beautiful moments and great sets, it just isn't consistent.The High frame rate often really enhances the experience, it just isn't there all the time, which leads to moments where the framerate changes with every cut. It looks really jittery in these scenes and is a little bit annoying.It's not a bad movie, but in my opinion far behind all the expectations and no where near the cinematic milestone some critics have talked about. It's a pretty standard, mediocre film with some great and some bad visuals, a weak uninspired story and a run time which is half an hour to long."
"This time he didn't succeed like the first time. He just reheated the film with another location and new characters. It is a film with a childish action but it does not reach the level of the first Avatar. There is no way. The sound, the story of the characters, looks as if they were written in a hurry on the bus, on the way to the filming studios. The film lasts far too long for such an action, it was practically stretched to the maximum. I expected more from Cameron for a film of this scope, especially since he waited 13 years for this. Indeed, the CGI effects exceeded expectations. Film seen in the IMax 3D cinema hall. If the first Avatar convinced me so much that I saw it countless times, the second part disappointed me so much that I won't see it again."
"I've Seen this all before Already with Avatar 1. And Avatar 1 was Way better than this absolute Bore Fest.Here are my Gripes -1. All of the Characters except for the Little 7 year old Navi Girl, were Shockingly Boring.2. Whilst I was watching. I felt like i already saw what Avatar 2 had to offer with Avatar 1. Avatar 1 had Insane 3D visuals at times, Avatar 2 has those in parts too, here's the problem with that - After you have seen something Spectacular the first Time, The Second time it's isn't So Spectacular, it's just Ok. This is Where Storyline should of played a Major part by being Strong in Story and Characters, but it doesn't.3. It felt Like a Collection of Scenes.4. The Movie is Just Boring as Hell.5. It only started getting interesting when the very Large amounts of Humans showed up and that was around 2 Hours and 10 minutes into the movie.6. Before those 2 hours, it was fine I guess, I did like the little scenes of them exploring the forest or exploring the sea. Those scenes were nice.7. What is it about my lack of interest in the Navi? Is it the Creature design? Well no, it's not that because near the end it Started getting Emotional, the score and music started to kicked in and you could see the Emotion in the creatures. Why did the Makers not see this? And Keep the Movie Emotionally Strong throughout?Overall, it was an absolute waste of Time."
"I was engrossed, of course. They explore a whole new part of the world. I can only imagine Disney creating a hotel version of their new living quarters. And, the climax near the end has some definite Titanic vibes. Unlike the first movie, this one leaves a few unanswered questions and story threads to be continued. We think we have a couple of them figured out, but will have to wait and see.Spoilers, the bad guys are back, even some of the dead ones. Part of Sigourney Weaver lives on. Her Avatar was pregnant!? I think it is a virgin birth due to Awa, but it's not explained. Also, a human baby was left behind, gets raised like Tarzan sort of. Is he the general's son? Maybe."
"Avatar: The Way of Water was a long time coming and it was certainly worth the wait. If you are a fan of the first film from 2009, you will certainly enjoy this newest installment in the franchise. If you have not seen the first film, I would suggest watching it before hand, as it is necessary in watching this film. In general, I would suggest watching the first one again to anyone seeing this one, just to jog your memory being that it was 13 years since the last one debuted. The visuals were stunning yet again and it is a film franchise like no other. James Cameron has done it again and I can't wait for Avatar 3!"
"Come on, give me a break, 8.1/10?! This movie is boring, way too long, overrated, and never should have been made. It's nothing more than tons of CGI with a dumb narrative. Most of the high reviews will sound like this, what an amazing movie, the visuals are so beautiful and breath taking. Yeah, that's the problem, it's mainly graphics, can you tell me what the story is about?A thirteen year wait for this, only to turn out as a James Cameron miss! Luckily I have the first Avatar on Blu-ray, I had to watch it again to feel some satisfaction. So disappointing, you should have saved your money James."
"Some pros include 1) Absolutely gorgeous design and visuals, the planet is jaw-dropping and the technology is just sooo cool 2) Top notch action sequences 3) A great villianSome cons include 1) Really did not have to be 3+ hours 2) Pretty much the same story as the first one 3) Too many ""look how pretty Pandora is"" moments 4) Not the most conclusive ending, leaves way for a sequel that will probably come out in 2035 5) Too many kids and teens (most of them starting their sentences with the word ""bro""All in all if you liked watching the first one you'll definitely want to check this one out, but it does come across as a rehash of the first except with water instead of trees."
Story is super predictable and generic. It's just stunning VFX shots worth seeing in big screen. Can give 10/10 to VFX and production quality but over all I can give around 8/10.Worth watching at the theatre in 3D to experience those stunning visual effects.Hats off to the all the vfx artists who showed their full potential.Story is weaker when compared to the first movie. This movie will hopefully change the movie vfx industry like the first one did. Looks like they have put all the work to make visuals spectacular than the story. Never thought blue alien kids would be that much adorable.
"On Friday I watch Avatar: The Way of Water (2022) in cinema , and this is what I thought.Now my positives of the film would be that I felt that the characters and main theme were more relatable than the first one, and the cgi ( especially the ocean ) look ten times more realistic. Lastly the negatives of the film, were that the story isn't that original, and some scenes felt a little bit too predictable. So after all my positives and negatives, I would give Avatar: The Way of Water (2022) an 8.2 out of ten, and I'm especially excited to see how these future sequels will live up to the success of these first first two instalments."
"I try to figure out what I would rate this movie as a stand alone, but I just can't do it. I have to compare it to the original, and by that comparison it does not measure up.The important thing this movie lacks, that was so special in the first, is that movie had heart. Cameron introduced us to a whole new world, but more than that he gave us a story that made us care about those people. He made me care deeply and that is why the first move is such a favorite of mine, and I suppose why it has made more money than any other film ever. This new movie has sweet characters, but we care about them only as much as we care for any character we know is just a fictional bit of storytelling. That is one way this movie really takes a hit. But that is not the only way. When I bring up the idea of this movie as a stand alone it is not just the first Avatar we would have to ignore, but also the other movies that it draws from so heavily. Titanic. The Abyss.Which brings up another issue. Cameron has done some amazing, creative work. This movie was amazing for its visuals, but otherwise the creativity seems to have been spent. I am left to think that Cameron wants to do Avatar movies for the rest of his life because what he has done before is all he's got left.There are so many holes in the story here that it shocks me it took him 13 years to put it together. Sully acts out of character. Issues arise that come up but go nowhere. The story is sloppy.Still, it is edge of your seat stuff. It is very entertaining. It is gorgeous. I did care about the characters, albeit only on a surface level, not deeply. If I didn't have to compare it to my favorite movie - which has so much heart that I love the way it makes me feel when I watch it over and over again - then it would be easy to be less critical."
"If you read imdb you would have thought it was another masterpiece. Unfortunately, its far worse than the first film and very preachy and repetitive. The technology is still great and cutting edge but i felt like vomiting when I saw Jake for the nth time trying to be a meathead kamikaze and winning the day. If you have watched the first 15 minutes you watched it all.The message is also very problematic because it doesnt jive with the cinematic experience. If I want to be extolled the merits of environmentalism this is not the forum for it, its entertainment, not a job interview or some science examination."
"This afternoon, I saw Avatar - The Way of Water in 3D in English (here in Germany). Wow, what a ride!. Of course, everyone knows that most characters are CGI performance capture visuals, but you don't see it, everything and everyone looks absolutely real.Storywise, maybe the first film was better, but this is definitely a film worth watching on the big screen in 3D. I also liked the music very much and am looking for the soundtrack on CD. Another nice thing is that there are now collectible figures.So, I've decided to see the film again at the cinema next week and hope that there will also be an extended DVD version,"
"The visuals were as great as I hoped. I saw it in Dolby Cinema 3D. It's beautiful and the Atmos sound great. Still, for the next Avatar I'll opt for IMAX again because this movie really benefits from the extra large screen.But beyond the visuals and sound I was disappointed. I'm not someone whose typically bothered by bad dialogue, but in this movie it stuck out. I was also disappointed in the musical score. No finesse, no goosebumps.Finally, the pacing needed more contrast. The scenery is beautiful but for dramatic impact I wish the movie slowed down a bit more between the action scenes. Where Denis Villeneuve succeeded for me (in Blade Runner 2049 and Dune), here I even found myself bored during the final."
"This is basically just a retelling of the first movie with Jake Sully now having kids with Neytiri. The US Marines are still attacking Pandora and are made to look like Nazis. There is now water Na'vi that live in the ocean. They could have been made to look cooler but they just have a lighter blue skin tone. Even the other sea creatures look bland and have no color.Another thing that bothers me about this movie is that the Na'vi use the Marines' weapons. I thought the Na'vi were against using that kind of weaponry as it doesn't jive with their beliefs. Apparently they are war mongers just like the Marines.This movie is extremely boring and WAY too long at over 3 hours. James Cameron should have never made this train wreck. He was trying to compete with Star Wars and Star Trek and completely missed the mark. The Force wasn't with him when he made this.EDIT: The effects are not groundbreaking at all. They are average compared to other CGI. Effects shouldn't make a movie. Story and characters should. Also, having everything take place on the same planet over and over again is extremely boring. At least in Star Wars and Star Trek there are multiple planets and species shown. James Cameron is just trying to make a buck and couldn't care less about storytelling and character development. That is obvious to anyone who isn't completely brainwashed by the special effects."
"One of the best movies I've seen in a LONG LONG time! Beautiful. Cultural. An experience. Visually stunning, storyline although similar to Avatar 1 has a lot more depth, I loved the increase in cultural aspect. Technology wise WOW! Best CGI, I've ever seen!!!! Unmatched!!!!! 10/10 as a fan, if I was being a critic 9/10 due to plot similarity but I loved every second of it and it didn't feel like 3 hours! When a movie that long doesn't feel that long, always a winner! Honestly I preferred this to the first one!!! I cannot wait for Avatar 3!!!!!! Highly recommend this movie to anyone! James Cameron did it again!!!"
"This movie is basiclly the same as the first in terms om quality. That is really all you need to know but I need minimum 600 characters so I will elaborate:Positivs:
The visuals look amazing, whenever they were underwater it felt like a documentary. The visuals are almost flawless except for a alien-shark-thing that moved wery cluncky and it felt like the frame rates slowed down for it.The direction and action are great (as expected from Cameron).Negativs:
The characters are pretty unintresting and when they were in danger I felt nothing.The story is extreamly predicable and cliche.The movie is long and the pacing felt off in the middle and it laked much forward momentum.Conclusion:
The movie looks great and is worth seeing in imax but it is very unoriginal and unintresting as far as the story goes and I will probably not rewatch it."
"When you wrote the first Avatar film, you did an amazing job, the story was heartfelt, the actions sequences blended well with the flow and the ending superb.Last night i rushed to the cinema with my sister as i had promised her we will watch the film even though she was doubtful the movie could be boring, i told her we cannot judge until we saw it and well after the experience here are my thoughts.The ending of Avatar part one, gave us a hero with a really mighty bird that gave him the honour among the Navi tribe, what happened to that beautiful bird ??? This really troubled me through out the whole movie ... even nowThe ending of Avatar part one, showed us the greedy and destructive humans were chased off Pandora ? How did the return, made a new base without the Navi and its mighty leader doing anything, how did this happen ???The Way of Water was a really boring and normal story, sorry to say this, there were times it felt was really stretched out without reason, also from mining one of the most precious metals in our solar system to now hunting pandora whales just for anti-aging liquid ... that really got me upset, it should have been a side story.The main antagonist in the story returns to pandora for revenge ? There should be more, revenge should be a ""by the way"" you should have given him a more real mission, probably clear out the whole navi tribe or find a way to destroy the home of the navi.You had a great team of writers but you failed to nail on important parts of the story, there's more i didn't like about the story but let me go to the good part.The visuals ... wow ... that kept me going and excited, this was flawless, every bit was well constructed and finished well, the acting, directing, the amazing camera work, the sound design, production design, soundtracks (from the first film) everything apart from the story kept me in my seat.For Avatar 3, work on the story, this is the core of the film in my opinion, read the story to a test audience and see their reaction for such a major production."
"I honestly do not understand what the buzz is about.The story
Lazy writing - this movie copies its predecessor to such an extent that they did not bother to change the main villain. 20% of the dialog was ""Bro, I got you bro."".The visuals
I must admit there were few moments in the movie that were visually amazing, however this is not planet earth. And for the most part, nothing shown in this movie is as groundbreaking as its predecessor. Compare this to a Marvel movie - what does it offer apart from couple imagined species that the former doesn't?The character development
Again, very lazy writing (writing reviews is not my job - I can get away with redundancy not a top grossing movie). They literally had 3 hours to build character, but all we have is the main villain's son who has absolutely no idea what to do or say, and gets away with almost anything? They tried to build inner conflict, but it comes off as, guess what? Lazy."
"The basic themes of part 1 and part 2 are just the same.First half: introducing us to the Avatar world (before land now sea)Second half : fighting the humans who want to take it over for some reason (before mineral now for having a new earth and the anti ageing whale enzymes)For the first avatar the awesome graphics was all that was needed to reach people. Having been introduced to that world already, now we need more gripping story.Example of mistakes - manhood forgetting their aim and working on revenge, people waiting for the movie to get over in the end when screen becomes blank a few times, when John gives up his position as king what happens to the land group etc etc."
"The Chinese got an old saying about the deterioration of human generations: ""The next generation is always worse than the former one."" It's also look alike the Chin Dynasty, when the Chin Empire was founded, it's so powerful and invincible, then it weakened within decades and finally overturned by a new force. This is exactly what we've seen in Cameron's Avatar movies. The original first one is great, but after 13 years extravaganza of mindless self-destruction, the sequel simply failed to maintain its greatness and became so lame and so disgustingly repetitive. I strongly suggest to Mr. Cameron: Better cancel your 3rd and 4th sequences of Avatar. If you couldn't do the 2nd better than the 1st or just equalize it, then there's no sense to continue waste your time and money again and again. It's just too foolish, man. I just can't believe what you've done during the 13 years period by only focusing on the visual effect and completely forgot to visualize a better story and plot. You just cashed in what you've achieved from the 1st Avatar success and wasted it like a blind mice. Making Avatar like a visually stunning video game with hollow repetitive cliche after cliche and criminally piled them up without innovation of ideas. You are a tailor who cut and pasted from the mold for the Emperor's 1st new cloth, but forgot to make a new underwear for the Emperor. So when the emperor coming out of the palace facing his tax paying crowd, they immediately found out that the Emperor was just wearing an new outwear but without underwear. Please seriously consider my advice: Stop churning out the 3rd and 4th sequels, our family could only consume one badly baked turkey on this Thanksgiving."
Movie is Cameroon trying to show us all the cool stuff he could think about right down to a glowing tadpole.Overdose of trying to please visually with nothing w.r.t a plot or story.8/10 is wayyy too high. People should stop overrating movies just coz they were visually good. This is a complete snoozefest and I slept for some good part of the movie during the final fight and guess what? I missed nothing.What's with this runtime? There is literally hundreds of scenes you can cut off and one won't even know or care about anything missing .I guess Cameron simply wanted not to waste the money spent on cgi so he decided to keep every single scene in without editing.4/10 purely coz the graphics were good and great job CGI team.
"As a visual spectacle, it is truly stunning. Strip the shiny distractions away though and honestly, it's a bit boring. It's at least 40 minutes too long, some of the dialogue is truly dreadful and the plot has all the complexity of a ham sandwich.People lauding Cameron's return...I just don't get it?? This is no Aliens, nor is it a patch on Terminator 2, two films that themselves had 'blow you away' visuals in their day (and still stand up over 3 decades later). The notable difference with those two over this though was that they brought so much more to the table. The pacing was far more efficient, the dialogue for both were memorable (I don't hear anyone quoting lines from Avatar), the scripts were lean and didn't waste screen time and the characters, man the characters! There is no Ellen Ripley, no Sarah Connor, no Kyle Reese, no Vasquez, T-800, Hicks, Hudson, Bishop, Newt etc here. It's not that the characters here a bad, but they're very run of the mill affairs and none of them are particularly memorable, or stand out in any significant way other than how much screen time they are allocated.This isn't to say that it's a bad film, because it isn't. But once you strip the very impressive effects away, it's just not a great film either. It's just a very average sequel with just one stand out appeal in the visuals. If you want to spend 3 hours marvelling at the effects, you'll have a ball. If you're looking for a bit more depth below the shiny surface though, well it'll be a very long 3 hours for you."
"""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is a mixed bag of a movie, with impressive visual effects but a lacklustre storyline. The screenplay is predictable and the runtime is unnecessarily long, bringing nothing new to the table in terms of content. The acting by the main cast is solid, but the overall movie is a snoozefest that feels more like a Nat Geo documentary rather than a blockbuster film. If you're a fan of James Cameron, you may find some enjoyment in this movie, but otherwise it falls short in terms of plot and excitement. The stunning VFX are the highlight of the film, but they alone can't save a lackluster story."
"I was really captivated by the movie and enjoyed every second of it. Me and my girlfriend left the theater in a state of shock. The movie really moved us and I had a weird feeling of sadness mixed with happiness which i couldn't explain it with words.They say that art is something that causes the observer to have an emotional reaction- well this movie definitely did that.Don't listen to ""the critics"" and go see it for yourself. Make sure you watch it at Imax if you have the possibility. Some people are impossible to please these days. These people worked 13 years on this movie so we can all be entertained for a few hours and instead of applauding them we go on and publicly criticize them.I want to thank everyone that was involved in the creation of this movie. You should all be proud of yourselves."
"I have to say that I enjoyed this movie but it lacks the impact and originality of the original.The narrative repeats too many of the elements of the first movie. It suffered from being too similar to the original in look, characters, pacing, themes, dialogue and storyline. There were no new sci-fi elements and feeling that one was being intellectually challenged in any way whatsoever unlike the original.The new characters brought very little to the project. That said, it is way better than most blockbuster sequels and it certainly outshines the recent Marvel movie releases.mind you that isn't hard to do.Aspects of the narrative are stretched through the entire 3 hours of the movie and become tiresome.The movie is visually stunning and the action scenes have real tempo and intensity.At times it was hard to recognise who was who as many of the characters look too similar.I'm hoping for some real originality Avatar 3 and not a third helping of the same. If we get the latter I'll end up wishing that they only ever made one Avatar movie."
"These movies are expected to be amazingly stunning have awesome visuals that's what makes them cool but these days the special effects and real life detail is more common especially with Star Wars and marvel. But this movie lacks so much on the writing and story line department it makes the movie painful to watch, the only reason I kept watching was because of how awesome the visuals are. It seems like they decided to hire subpar writers who came up with a predictable and simple screenplay and awful dialogue to save on money or something, after 13 years I was expecting a more detailed story and something with more substance than just somehow resurrecting the original bad guy and choosing Nurse Jackie as the new military leader lol (what a joke) who has the worst military leader acting job I've ever seen, I was hoping for more tribal infighting or something that wasn't just a rewrite of the first movie script, but I guess with the new Star Wars movies I can't be disappointed in Disney because they are just known for putting out dead beat sequels to their big franchise's."
"Everything you could want out of a sequel and more. The protagonist has matured greatly and looks even cooler. A whole cast of new characters who are a joy to watch grow and learn. You get to see a whole other side of Pandora never explored before and the visuals (especially in IMAX-3D) are so immersive it truly feels like you are spending time on this fictional world. Even the villain has more added depth to him this time around making some of the relationships in this film super complex and interesting. All of the new lore is super enriching from the new species, to the new locations etc. And the range of emotions this film takes you through is truly inspirational.If you liked the original you will love the sequel."
"Cameron to Spielberg: ""I put down the book and called Michael Crichton to buy the film rights, but you've got the deal first. And I'm glad you did it, if it's me the result will be totally different.""When Avatar was released, it was really something unique, the visual effects were out of this world. But many, including the fans, admit how apart from the avatar concept the story was so ordinary and familiar, making it too predictable. It's the visuals and 3D sold the film, and the romance that he learned from Titanic attracted wider demographic.When the Avatar sequels were officially announced, I thought how is he's going to do this again, the avatar concept is in the past, I can't think of any original story continue, maybe he still has something in the sleeve as far as tech goes.Flash forward to now, looks like he's accepted that the fact that the avatar concept is no longer a device, you probably only see the pod twice the entire 3 hours.Next maybe a story then that I hope to make me think ""how did he come up with this"". But nope, same old story, outside intruders and the natives fight for their home, war, add whalers with a large hovercraft, ROVs, crabs. But it's not the action you've come to expect from Cameron, if you say this was directed by Bay I could believe it. Many scenes homages to The Abyss but you guessed it, it's on water there will be some big ship sinking at the end. Even a jump scare that we can see coming miles away. And I guess it makes sense, humans never learn, they brought even larger military fleet to the planet and they only hire whaling boats to war? Where are the big war planes? Just because it's on water doesn't mean you can't call them.The way they bring back Quartrich and his henchmen is kind of clever, but Lang looks old in the video recording that was supposed to be before his death and with this they can basically bring him back every time he dies. He even looks like Jake in the Na'vi body, actually it took me a while to recognize all the faces.And yes unobtanium is no longer the McGuffin, it's a whale's brain or something that sells for $80 million a bottle.A good 90 minutes is about Jake's family and Na'vi's daily life. We've had this before, replace the jungle with the sea, replace the romance with family love, add parenting lessons, teen troubles. It's not a bad thing, we get to know the characters very well, but it's starting to feel like a part of young adult TV drama series, or even a documentary following some tribes in a secluded island somewhere. Although here there's a couple of scenes to set up the third act.Jake is okay, natural progression to a father. Neytiri cries a lot, but even more fierce than before, reminding me of the queen b**ch from Aliens. Add the quintessential death. And is Kiri a reincarnation of Grace ?Speaking of kids, was it hinted at all in the original that Quartrich had a kid ? Anyway, I like Spider, he's with the Na'vi, no he is a Na'vi, but he gets to show he's own face. Just wondering, how does the gas mask work? Doesn't look like it has a tank, maybe it creates oxygen which is very cool because it can also be used underwater.Then comes the visuals, here he excels, still not something that wowed me like the original did but impressive nonetheless. You never think of anything to be CGI anymore, the Na'vi is flesh and blood, physics is spot on. That is what it the technology should be for.So there you go, a visual feast with a straight forward familiar story, no alien queen surprising you when you thought it's over. This is Jurassic Park that he glad he did not directed, not Aliens. Let's just say I miss the old darker James Cameron, before Titanic, before love stories. And looks like we can stop hoping, a lot more of Pandora coming our way.I expected something new but that's only the water. It's like Waterworld except everything is so clean and beautiful.Go see it, take the small kids (for a James Cameron film now you can). Worth every penny, just don't expect something meaningful.It's okay to just hold your pee, you don't need to see it again to understand the story, if you do want to see it again it's likely just for the visuals.3.07 out of 5 stars."
"Beautiful movie with stunning visuals, it was amazing watching it in 4dx 3D a real experience, some very sad and touching moments! I wish the ""bad guy"" changed for the better because of his son and the beauty of the land, but unfortunately that wasn't the case. I think the movie was a bit too long and could have been 30mins shorter but overall great movie, with the same great message about human greed and the lack of respect for sentient creatures. It's worth a watch for the whole family though, but make sure to see in cinema and do so in 4dx 3D the water effects with the bubbles are a real treat for kids."
"I feel like I must be the only one who was bored about two hours into the movie? Jack Sulley was completely unlikeable and extremely harsh on his family. We barely see any moments of him and Neytiri. And bringing back the villains from the first film? WHY? There's SO many different ways James Cameron could have went with this film and I feel like he thought, ""hey, remember those guys we killed off? Let's bring them back and focus the entire movie on revenge for his death."" Also, the sky people are back and we see they have an enormous compound (well, more like a city), and Jake decides to just leave?? Like that will solve the problem of their people? The sky people are still there and he thinks leaving his home and finding a new one will protect his family. ""They're coming for me,"" actually Jake, they are but they want to take over the entire planet as well and you know that. The movie would have been so much better if it focused on the new general and Jake has to reunite the clans again. Instead, we're taken to a new place and, while the images are beautiful, we're watching 90 minutes of people swimming. Not to mention Spider saves his ""dad"" in the end after his father is the cause of this chaos and the death of Jakes son. Side note, there's no way that guy was still alive after being underwater for so long. I loved the first movie and was really excited to see this but it's obvious James Cameron is going for best picture more than anything. I'm sure this movie will win that award, but it was lacking in all other aspects."
"Impressive pictures for 3 hours. You can see how CGI was still improving over the last 13 years. But still the rendered characters were moving slightly unnatural and the facial expressions (always the biggest challenge for CGI characters) were still a bit too ""stiff"" sometimes.Overall the movie is 3 hours eye candy out of the CGI rendering farm. Very impressive artwork.But unfortunately that's about it. The plot of the movie is very thin and almost stupid at times. The whole story could have been told in an hour max. The other 2 hours are just pretty pictures again and again and again.I don't want to dive too much into details here. Neither the come back of the bad guy as a native, nor the Jesus reference by one of the characters, or the rather stupid idea of the ""whale"" hunt (out of the blue there is whale hunting a thing, even though the new arrival of humans was just a bit longer than a year ago), and so on.But what I disliked in particular, was the ending. The son of the bad guy lets his father escape, instead of imprisoning or killing him, even after he witnessed the cruelty he was capable of and being fully aware that letting him go would bring much more suffering to everybody. Really?Well, there are two more Avatar movies planned. It seems that they had to spread the story thin and implement an uninspired cliff hanger at the end, to make the story somehow dragging on for another 6 hours full off nothingness and unlikely story twists.I give it a 4/10. And the 4 only because of the really tasty CGI work. The story itself is a 1, unfortunately."
"There were some aspects that bothered, but I think they were negligible. Their adopted tween daughter being voiced by a grown woman broke the immersion for me, every time she spoke. The movie starts off with a lot of exposition, a bit of retconning, and some serious deus ex machina. Oh, it's actually a pity that two of the most compelling characters died at the end of the previous movie! No worries, they're both alive again, in some way. The addition of Spider felt like a plot device, rather than a natural part of the story. He fell flat for me, as did his friendship with Kiri. And, of course, the Papyrus font is hideous as ever. I really hoped they would have dropped it.But for every small thing that bothered me, there is so much wonder and beauty and intrigue. I wanted to see a lot more of the world of Avatar, and this film delivered in spades. There's touching connections, between people and between people and animals. There's action packed sequences that I found truly thrilling, because I was rooting for the characters. I felt connected to them. The villains retain some likeability, which helps maintain the mystery if they're going to survive or not.This movie is magical and touching. I really enjoyed the first one and re-watched it occasionally, because it's clear-cut but powerful. I know it's a meme to hate on it and to be above enjoying it. But although it's flawed, I still think it offers poignant commentary on the way humans destroy nature. I think this second offering is even better. The writing is still lean, but simplicity doesn't equal stupidity. Its core message is strong: we are killing our mother."
It's basically a rip off from any cowboy Indian movie made no1 was bad I fell asleep no2 was worse def hope 3 blows up how anyone can call call it a movie is beyond one self I say should be called smurfs with tails. I mean story is same nearly as no1 jake could be any John Wayne or Clint Eastwood in any of his early roles baddies are white men again more woke crap amazes me how he managed to get more of these made seems if go cinema these days it's remakes marvel or comic books or movies which should not be made. Even the wailing and dancing singing is just same as any Indian or Zulu movie made.
"This is the first movie I recommend you to watch in the lower frame rate instead of the higher 48 fps. Serious lagging throughout the film which is honestly a super bad experience. And also watch it in IMAX 3D if both possible.If you have seen Black Panther, this is basically the same underwater sht and also 3 hour long. So save you the time.The cinematographer sucks this time round, lots of shaky camera, weak first person shot and pretty much a documentary base on how it was shot.Also, trying to runaway to another island so that the sky people attack other tribe instead of yours is pretty stupid of a plot."
"I really enjoyed the first movie, with its use of modern technology and visuals was amazing!On seeing the the second movie it goes even further, having read about the making of the movie and having the actors do mo cap under water was amazing to see actors going extra mile to make this movie eve more ground breaking than the first.I thought the story was brilliant, taking us away from the forest to another part of the planet living with the water people, good tie in with the current state of affairs with global warming, politics aside... Action was fluent and plot was really good and amazing again in 3D!Will be buying 4k box set once out, go see to be blown away just by the visuals alone!"
"As many others said so far, this is a dissapointment in terms of story, clichee, characters developments and so on. Nothing new is brought to the movie, except for the water which makes us see about an hour of Nat Geo documentary of the life in the waters. The tribe living there has nothing to reveal to us, a story of their own, the villain is only (?) wanting to kill jake and that is it, the main 2 female characters (tribe wives of the leader) are only wanting to go to war and they scream a lot. You would have thought that after so many years passed Neytiri would be more diplomat about how things happen. But no, she is the same impulsive person that does not think ahead."
"Where can I even start? Absolutely remarkable and beyond mind blowing. There is no word to describe how perfect this movie is. Avatar movie series will go down in history for the generations to come. Starts where it left of, Masterpiece of a Story, litreally eye candy visuals, the charecters design are absolutely amazing, such a emotional roller coaster ride, you get connected to the characters so easily and on a emotional level, as far as you litreally feel everything they have gone through and are going through. What's not to love? I can go on for eternity describing how beyond phenomenal this movie is and I still won't finish. You get the idea right? Like it's THAT PERFECT of a movie. Thank you James Cameron, there is truly no one like you."
"The visuals are for the vast majority really good, the kids especially the younger ones fall into the uncanny valley and look kind of weird.The story is anemic and a bit of it kind of stick out like a sore thumb because it dosen't make sense.1. The humans are going to colonize Pandora, never brought up again in the movie.2. once spider is caught they just give up and leave, like their whole life, friends and everybody they were sworn to protect, because a couple of Avatars might find out where they are, Avatars they have shown to be able to kill, and later on kill without trouble.3. Lo'ak's whale friends, well the fact that some tribes kids lure him out to the deep ocean to try and murder him.4. They call a combat helicopter out to look at their daughter after she has a ''seizure'', only to tell them to leave and have a medicin woman look at her, leading into the third act, because suprise, suprise the humans tracked it.The story boils down to; Bad guy return and capture our kids so we run away, then slice of life movie, then bad guys return capture the kids and run away, but to get to the final confrontation, the kids are caught again!And the human characters are utter garbage, none of them act like modern humans, the whalers that have the youth serum can't synthazie it I suppose, so they can be evil, and they are all like ''sure we are going to help you start a war with the natives, no moral question there,''And why even introduce general Earth is Dying?She does nothing."
Just loved the story and the movie in general. My kids loved it even more. I enjoy the story from the begging to the end end. I am not sure what to expect for the rest of the coming movies but for sure they will be really amazing. I watched the movie with my kids and parents it means this is for all ages and one thing I really enjoy is how the movie show one issues we have in real live with the haunting in our seas. So everyone who loves sci-fi must watch this movie. Finally I am grateful for living in this age when pretty much everything can me created and put it in the movies. Thanks James for bringing all this.
"Basically, the storyline or 'format' is almost the same as the first one, just that it's moving from the land to the sea. It is a duplicate of the 1st one in many instances, e.g. Instead of deforestation and strip mining, it is slaughtering the whales! Instead of riding on the ""flying creatures,"" they are riding on the marine creatures... However, the scale of this sequence is much smaller, focusing on a man's duty to protect his family.The pace is good!! It is filled with amazing CGI and actions to keep your interest going, and your boredom away, even though it is a 192-minute movie!The movie could be split into 3 parts: The 1st part is about the introduction of characters. As such, anyone who does not watch the 1st episode will learn to know the characters of Sully & his family members + spider + the bad guys. Of course, having watched the 1st episode is always advantageous to knowing this movie better.The 2nd part is that they go underwater. This is where one will see how visually impressive and breathtaking the movie is, with soothing colors and all kinds of amazing marine creatures. This part may be slightly lengthy, but overall it is ok!The 3rd part is all actions pushing toward the final battle. Audiences will get all kinds of visual excitement from the actions.One thing I love about this movie is that it addresses most of the doubts, e.g. Why is Tulkun so intelligent? What are the steps of hunting Tulkun? What does 'butterfly jelly fish' do and so on. With this, it is self-explanatory, or it clears your doubts when things happen!However, this movie is not perfect, and there are some drawbacks as follows:
Firstly, the Major Quaritch (bad guy) is a military guy, but I saw no tactical or logical wartime attack or defense strategies from him throughout the movie.Secondly, the emotional value is much weaker this time. It touches on family ties, but it's rather touch-n-go, and audiences are unlikely to be moved or emotionally involved. And, the emotional bond between Tulkun the kids could hardly touch one's heart too.I gave 3.75/ 5.0. Overall, it's a nice movie. It maintains the standard or quality as of the 1st episode. BUT, what's more, other than the same environmental theme (e.g., deforestation, whale conservation) + beautiful CGI? I supposed audiences would wish to see more than these, after the long wait of 13 years later."
"There was nothing that made me gasp or cheer or get emotional about. Generic story of bad egotistical male hunting a good happy man and his family. Yawn. After 12 years I expected a hell of a lot more. This movie should have been released in 2011.Since 2009 I expected to see something really great, something new, something that would be worth the wait, but there wasn't anything new since 2009. Same colorful indigenous clan along with colorful creatures.The story had protentional after the first hour, but you quickly realize that it can only go in one direction and have a overused conclusion as we have seen time and time again
.The saddest part of the whole story is that it had absolutely no conclusion whatsoever."
"Avoid watching Avatar-2. It is too self indulgent. 12 years ago they fought in the forest. Now, they fight in water. That too for over 3 hours.Just how much can you actually admire great Vfx and for how long? Within 1 hour, I went fromWow! Wow! Wow to yawn ! Yawn! YAWN!What a relief it was to get out of the theatre!Watch it for realistic special effects and only if you have the patience to sit through 3 hours 20 minutes ! But don't say I didn't warn you'll!With such a tried and worn out storyline which is predictable and cringe inducing even your Vfx can't save Avatar-2Sorry to burst the water bubble but, I just couldn't bring myself to like it."
"It's such an amazing visual wonder. Almost as if we were diving into a Monet painting.Without a doubt, the most stunning and immersive audiovisual experience in the history of the 7th art. The story has a plot and every second of the more than 3 hours is worth it. The script improves a lot in relation to the first one, but what will really catch the audience is the visual experience. It's some of the best action sequences I've ever seen on the big screen. Technical perfection was raised to the last power. The cast is very tight.It's so worth watching in 3D on the biggest screen possible. It's not about objects popping off the screen. It's about total immersion. You believe that Pandora is a real world.If there is any movie that makes you leave the comfort of streaming, without a doubt, that movie is called Avatar: The Way of Water."
"The movie is over-rated just because of breath taking Visuals.Other than Visuals the movie lacks interesting storyline and would make you bore at certain scenes.Some scenes look too realistic and would make you feel that Avatarverse does exist in some other parallel universe.Watch the movie purely for breath taking 3D effects and amazing Visuals and CGI from James Cameroon.Don't watch it if you are looking for interesting storyline.I am disappointed with part 2,as I had huge expectation from storyline and is nothing like Avatar Part 1 which still could be rewatched and still feels new and interesting to me."
"I had to give this a 10, because I really can't think of any areas it could be improved. I went to see it in 3D, which I recommend everyone does if they can.It's a great follow up, with the storyline seamlessly continuing on from the original Avatar movie. Visually, the bar has been raised even further. It is simply stunning to look at, the 3D is amazing. The sound, including all dialogue is crystal clear. There's an awful lot of films these days where the dialogue is either badly recorded, or impaired by overloud music. Avatar TWOW is not one of them. The film is simply 3+ hours of gripping entertainment. I believe James Cameron is also using this platform, by the use of very similar parallels to things that happen right here on earth, to highlight, and raise awareness of what goes on around us every day. I've seen some scathing reviews from critics, mostly by people who hated the first film (well they're not exactly likely to embrace this one either then are they) or have some kind of vendetta against James Cameron. Whatever. Ignore them. Go and see it. Immerse yourself in it. No pun intended."
"At 3 hours 12 minutes, it's way too long to keep me entertained throughout, even with the mind blowing special effects. They truly are amazing & gorgeous to look at. It's like watching an underwater documentary, they are so realistic. That being said. It's still too long.I believe, for most cinema going people, that will be the case especially during the middle section - with the kids, which seems to drag on way longer than necessary, which I think was to showcase the sfx, but in this case, too much of a good thing.That section could've lost, at least 30 minutes which would've made it a more thrilling spectacle.3/10."
"Easily the movie of the year. Breathtaking cinematically and, in my opinion, believe the character development to be absolutely incredible. The torch has been effortlessly passed to the younger actors/actresses with convincing potential for the upcoming films.Britain Dalton (Lo'ak) really grabbed the wheel and took off with this role and handled it with ease being such a young actor. He incapsulates Jake Sully's early characteristics as a strong willed, renegade boy and also learns Jake's older attributes like accountability and responsibility in the end. He is truly Jake Sully's son.Jake and Neytiri's children are the future of Avatar and it is exciting to see the future construct of this franchise. James Cameron really took the time with each of them and it paid off in the end. Alongside that, the world development in Pandora is spectacular/awe-inspiring. I was so pleased to see a new tribe, learn their quirks/traditions/culture, and have a good laugh at the Sully family struggle with learning the ways of their new home. So satisfying.Although this movie is long and I believe it was necessary considering the amount of development that needed to occur, they create an un-ending amount of new avenues to explore from the Water tribes, Tulkun whales, even re-visiting the forest tribes. There's so much here!!The only thing that bothered me was Zoe Saldana's role (Neytiri). I wanted so much more and felt like she was left out in a lot of important scenes. Sully's role was so important in the movie with the development in their children and it really showed. When a problem occurred with the children, Sully was there to resolve it. I understand the dynamics and roles of tribes where a mother's duties are different from the father's but there's nothing better than a mother's comfort and I didn't see that in the movie. A moment in particular really caught my eye, was the scene of the entire family learning the ways of the water tribe. Unless I missed it, I didn't see a single scene where Neytiri was shown learning the techniques and culture of the water tribe. Another is in the end where Jake and Neytiri are visiting Neteyam in the spirit world. Jake has a very touching moment with his son, but sadly Neytiri is just off behind a tree watching... Very disappointing and I'm upset for Zoe Saldana in that regard.Otherwise, I give this movie a solid 9.5, sadly that is not and option on IMDb so I'd have to round down on this one to a 9. Still an incredible movie. Thank you James Cameron and all the cast and crew for ending 2022 on a high note!"
So I went into this movie not being the biggest fan of the first movie as I thought it was boring at points but this movie is so much better than the first one and I truly do enjoy it. The action is some of the best I've seen in so long its truly stunning and so beautiful and this movie is so damn good. The CGI and visuals is also some of the best I've ever seen and it's so incredible. Some negatives I have is that the character of Spider I thought he didn't really have that much of a impact in this movie and I thought he was kinda clueless at points but overall I did really enjoy this movie and think it's good.
"#1 If this movie took place 6 months after the first.. it would have made sense without the offsprings ofcourse....it took many years for the sky people to return. Our Hero, with his human friends, could have used the unobtanium and built defences to help them fight the next invasion. He was dumb enough not to plan it. #2 - he wants to save the Navi from sky people attack and moves to another tribe and bring them and whales into peril. He could have as well stayed with his previous tribe. #3 if the villian was hunting for him, he could have confronted them directly and saved many deaths. #4 post eclipse the fish tribe just disappear from the battlefield leaving hero and his family to fight.Watch videos of Great Barrier Reef and Japanese whale hunting... that is mostly the content of this movie."
"This movies is going raise the bar of Hard work and smart work Directors and Producers and Actor put in . A perfect movies which is blend of Technology and Hard work of a lot of people. I highly recommend to watch this movies on bigger screen to really enjoy the true essence of this movie. I did watch Avatar 1 before going to buy tickets for the part 2 to make sure I do not miss the bridge between two. The wait of 13 years was worth it for me. A lot of people trying hard to find the errors in this movies which they may find but what is the point ? Enjoy the movie, the use of technology and go home. Critics can find flaws in anything because that is their job. I went to watch this movie, bought some popcorns, did use the washroom before hand lol and enjoyed the movies. No complaint at all. Yes I will not not prefer to watch it again because once is enough for me!"
"Well Cameroon is back after 13 years of avatar. When avatar came out it was an absolute surprise for everyone, nothing anyone had ever seen. People saw the movie in droves and made it biggest blockbuster of all time.Avatar 2 is not a surprise. It is a shock! What Cameroon has done here is just not understandable. There is absolutely no coherence in the story line, things pop up in one place and then just disappear, there is just nothing binding everything together.He shows us a new world under water and no doubt it is beautiful. But that's not what we paid for. We paid for entertainment not a 3.5 hours national geographic under water episode.Want to see something fun? See avatar 1.Avatar 2, give it a skip. Not recommended. Cameroon do better with 3 please."
"It's beautiful, fairly well paced and extremely touching, especially to me as both a father and older brother.It's easy to focus on the negatives but I'm kinda gonna have to cause they're weighing on me.As long as the movie runs for (it felt long, but not really a drag), it still rushed through introducing new characters in a way the original did not. I had no idea what the eldest son's name was until he died, and even then it just sounds like his name is Dayum, so that's what I'm going to refer to him from now on. No idea of any names of humans other than ones that were in the original movie. I also knew Dayum was gonna die from the first minute (maybe not him in particular, but it was immediately obvious one of Jakes kids was gonna get offed)I was concerned about bringing back both Sigourney Weaver and Stephan Langs characters, it felt like lazy writing. While bringing back Quaritch makes it easy to introduce the human antagonists without having to spend much time actually introducing them, it was definitely lazy. Bringing back Weaver as her characters daughter worked well in my opining, although the whole ""immaculate conception"" thing definitely feels like they're setting her up as some sort of messiah for a future movie. You saw it here first.Some of my unanswered questions include:How did they manage to bring back Quaritch and co when the only person who has managed to be transplanted permanently into an avatar is Jake?How do those whale things understand sign language? That felt really dumb and you could still have had No'ak's bond with that particular one without going that far.Where did all the water Na'vi go halfway through the final battle?Why did they not spend more time exploring the fact that it is apparently necessary to colonise the planet as Earth is dying? This actually opens up a really intriguing plot with lots of grey where they could try to balance the necessity of colonisation to save the species as opposed to the atrocities they've already committed there. But no, they went with the lazy ""humans = bad, Na'vi = good"" angle."
"While the first Avatar was akin to Disney's Atlantis, this sequel has quite a bit of Tarzan at its core.It's a rather simple movie, really.. and if you think about it, it all makes perfect sense and is even obvious (that villain, amongst many ideas). There are noticeable parts that are there for ""the movie to happen"". And once you are done with it, you realize it barely makes a dent in the grand scale of the universe and things barely change.. but now you are knee-deep in characters, interactions, motivations and lore.Personally, I think this is better than the original.. and it does a much better job at restarting an old franchise (than Star Wars' The Force Awakens) by focusing on laying great groundwork and planting the many seeds for what is to come (you can even start to imagine what the next scripts will look like) over telling a grand story from the get go. Having said that.. you barely feel the 3 hours, you forget you are in a theater, and you find yourself breathing and holding your breath with the characters!! Everything they created is used and then some. With impressive layers of immaculate visuals, actions and mesmerizing movements. Excellent performances by everyone, and quite satisfying developments. The phrase ""greater than the sum of its parts"" is quite apt for Avatar 2. So, seeing 5 credited writers is not so shocking to me! Thankfully, much better writers than Cameron alone. And like Maverick, it's a movie that knows what to deliver to its audience and on what makes movies worth seeing.Would easily recommend it! 3D not necessary, as the script and execution are good enough without the gimmick.. but might as well splurge and go to the biggest screen possible and all that.It is a solid 7 in my book (okay story and pacing), but the visuals are too impressive (so 7.5 in my heart)."
"Story line in short-Moving from the sweeping vistas of Pandora's forests, James Cameron trains his vision on its seas in Avatar: The Way Of Water. Former marine Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) left his human form in the 2009 original film to become one with the Na'vi and join his mate, Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) in the fight to preserve the land and its people. The two have settled into domesticity and started a family, but as they say, peace never lasts long. The Sullys' world is threatened once again and Jake has to regroup to protect his family after all this time.1. Animation and VFX super quality.2. Acting not bad.3. Action Scenes is fine.4. The story is boring.5. climax is not good.A. You can watch the movie once.B. Not like the previous film.C. The 2009 film was better than this.D. Some felt scattered.E. It could have been done better."
"First Impressions:After what felt like the longest time, my friends and I went to see ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" in theatres. We chose INOX 3D for this movie, and were stunned at the level of attention in every frame. The visuals were almost futuristic in their realism. It all felt so compelling and authentic.Whoever said the movie lacked a good story certainly didn't pay attention to the first one. Both it and ""Way of Water"" had a simple storyline that was also deeply meaningful and metaphorical.The Crew:James Cameron as director and writer did it again. He created a multi-faceted adventure that captured so much meaning, especially in relation to our own Earth and our lives on it.Writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, along with Josh Friedman and Shane Salerno, did remarkable work keeping the plotline simple yet deep.Simon Franglen's musical scoring was outstanding.Russell Carpenter's cinematography was teleportive and brilliant.Editing, sound effects and production design were stellar.Art direction, set decoration, and hair-makeup were superb.Bob Buck and Deborah L. Scott's costume design was praiseworthy, more so because they essentially had to work with swimsuits for the barely clad characters in the story. Somehow, they gave them a distinction worth appreciating.Stunts and special effects were admirable.The Cast:Sam Worthington as Jake Sully was amazing.Zoe Saldana as Neytiri was superb.Stephen Lang as Quaritch was great.Kate Winslet as Ronal was noteworthy.Cliff Curtis as Tonowari was good.Jamie Flatters as Neteyam was quite good
Britain Dalton as Lo'ak was excellent.Trinity Jo-Li Bliss as Tuk was wonderful.Jack Champion as Spider was notable.Sigourney Weaver as Kiri (note: her days as Dr. Grace Augustine were over) was memorable.Bailey Bass as Tsireya was promising.Filip Geljo as Aonung was great.Jemaine Clement as Dr. Ian Garvin was good.Brendan Cowell as Scoresby was great.Plot Summary & Analysis :It was a genuinely family-centric story this time around. Jake Sully (played by Sam Worthington) had children with Neytiri (played by Zoe Saldana) and they were being targeted by Quaritch (Stephen Lang) for perceived treacheries of the past.I loved how they convincingly took the previously dead Quaritch and transferred his consciousness into a full-fledged Na'Vi body. All the reasons and sequences around his new form were captivating and portentous.I would have liked to see more from Ronal (Kate Winslet), but I have a feeling they are saving her most important contributions for the next instalment in the ""Avatar"" franchise.The new 'Sea People' story arc, and every frame in which they featured, was a masterpiece and visual treat rolled into one. Water-based CGI is one of the hardest to achieve high credibility ratings, so all those sequences truly spoke to Cameron and company's skill and dedication.The flora and fauna of this world were fascinating, to say the least. The bioluminescence and closed eco-systems were each on point, scientifically speaking.The whale-based Tulkuns were a beautiful addition to the creature roster. They not only brought powerful meaning and emotion to the overall story context in ""Avatar: The Way of Water"", but also an intelligence that was every bit as credible and wonderful as it was portrayed to be.The Metkayina (Sea People) had a distinct biology and culture that was remarkable and engaging. As for their traditions and practices, some of them were similar to those in Asia. The organic leaf packaging and net throwing technique were two overtly noticeable elements in this regard.As for other creatures... The mountain banshees continued to play pivotal parts in ""Way of Water"". Aside from them, new oceanic creatures like the predatory Akula added to the entertainment value.The Ilu - a plesiosaur-like swimming creatures - were outstanding in every way. Where direhorses served the Na'Vi on land, the Ilu were their rides under the water. Some hypnotizing movements and visuals from these creatures kept my attention on them whenever they came on the scene.The Skimwings were yet another brilliant addition to the mix. Inspired by our Earth's flying fish, but with a predatory twist, these creatures were warrior mounts that could be ridden, or rather half flown, into battle. The way they used their wings and tails was enthralling in every way.Undersea life like bioluminescent anemonoids, pincer fish, and so many more whose names I am yet to learn - waiting for a detailed book about them in future - all made ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" an unforgettable journey that still glowed strong despite the thirteen-year release gap for this production.As for Sully's kids, they each gave stunning performances and took the story along promising lanes. Neteyam (Sully's oldest kid, a son, played by Jamie Flatters), Lo'ak (Sully's second kid, another son, played by Britain Dalton), and Tuk (Sully's youngest kid, a daughter, played by Trinity Jo-Li Bliss) were amazing in their own ways.Sully and Neytiri's adopted daughter Kiri (Sigourney Weaver's child, who was curiously played by Weaver herself) was intriguing and could wield certain 'powers' that we may yet see more of in the next movie.Another adopted kid who was part of Sully and Neytiri's Na'Vi family, but remained human, was a boy named Spider (played by Jack Champion) who brought an interesting vibe to the story. He was born in the human Pandoran base of Hell's Gate and, in this movie, was shown to be the son of Col. Quaritch. Spider's story had room for clarification, which a future movie may well provide.Now, if the ending of ""Way of Water"" was anything to judge by, this movie could take its beloved characters farther in future. Moreover, this entire franchise is in the right hands. James Cameron can rest assured that his world-building and character-branching prowess is sharper than ever.Final Notes:Every character contributed excellence to ""Avatar: The Way of Water"". The creatures were outstanding as well and didn't come across as passable or familiar, especially considering how biodiversity-rich the fauna and flora were in the first movie.I had hoped to see more of Kate Winslet's Ronal and the Great Leonopteryx (""last shadow"") that Sully rode into battle in the first movie. But I'm sure Cameron has more plans for them in the next.Speaking of which, the ending of ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" was rife with promise and potential. I heard a rumour that Cameron was already done filming the other instalments in this mega-franchise, so we may not have to wait another decade to see ""Avatar 3""."
"I watched ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" in the cinema in 3D and it was a pretty decent experience. I don't know how James Cameron keeps doing this... How much money does he have because just wow. Everything looked so beautiful and eye-catching just like the first movie. Soundtrack was nice and fitting and the action scenes were amazing from start to end. It gave me very similar vibes to the prequel which is a good thing.Now for the bad though. The ending was all over the place, I did not like it. I fell asleep like 3 times because the movie was so long, it could've easily been less than 3 hours and still been good but that is what that is. Also kids in general ruin movies for me. Every time there's a kid and drama revolves around them, it just doesn't entertain me. I would've loved if it kept revolving 'just' around Jake and his gf. But those are just cherry pickings. In general it was almost as good as the prequel in my opinion. Definitely give it a watch."
"How to describe the feeling of a spectator who feels humiliated, even slapped by the inanity of the purpose of a film extended for more than 3 hours?The first avatar was a surprise and an event, the second opus, thirteen years later, uses the same characters, all of them and their children, resurrected and newborn, to deliver a bad war film, noisy, badly edited, with botched narrative axes, shortcuts repeating the situations of the first opus. We see scenes from Titanic being rehashed, with no genius in their self-citation. The magic, the science fiction, the characters are crushed into a caricature, where the only option is violence and death. Many variations and rich scenes could have been exploited: the society of tyrant old earthlings seeking immortality at the cost of life and the invasion of an entire territory, for example. Everything is sad, violent, whiny and disappointing. What a shame."
"The pictures and cinematography was awesome probs to everyone that worked on it but...
the writing was not good the plot was awful, no character development other than a clone not wanting to kill his human son (not really his), huge plot holes, antagonist sucks and has no real motive or deeper meaning/plan but hey he's blue now - white cliche american navy general with a scar
awful hollywood one liners à la it's showtime baby or Hasta la vista, baby.Same story line - evil americans want to kill indigenous people because they need tree/whale sperm...
the kids were annoying and the rebel son made the same mistake 12 times the whole second part of the movie was - the kids getting kidnapped and retrievedthe music wasn't as epic as the first time idk if Mr zimmer was included - but yes the weekend...the end fight was relatively small in comparison to the first movie..."
"I was left wanting for more, even though I had to control my p** because of no interval break at the multiplex where I was witnessing this cinematic marvel and I believe the extra adrenaline rushing action sequences in the last hour were making me somehow uncomfortable in a very funny way 😂😂😂Yes 3+ hours is a very lengthy run time, but so is 13 years wait and James Cameron knew that nothing less than this would do justice to the fans of the first part. I don't think I will be adding anything new, if I say that it is a cinematic masterpiece and that the real world may start to look little dull even if you are living in Kashmir, because a lot has been said and every word of praise coming out from anybody is well deserved one.However, I do feel that the 3D version could have been a little better. I was expecting more arrow shots from Neytri flying through the screen and hitting me than the invaders (this is something I enjoyed in the first part). Yes, the 3D rain was spectacular and so was the diving session.This had to be a sequel about revenge of the hurt ego of the thrashed invaders and so I was kind of expecting the same kind of storytelling and anything different would have looked completely off hook. So, although little predictable but completely thrilling and will definitely leave you wanting for more."
"I read somewhere that James Cameron is the best director what comes to visuals and technique. Well after seeing Avatar 2 in 3D...I have to say it is the most amazing and beautiful 3D movie I have ever seen.I only wonder how people see it since some 40%ish peeps are looking it in 2D IMAX theaters. THAT movie is MEANT TO be watched in 3D.Story is well...ok...it is good...yes it is very good. IMO it is not as good as original AVATAR movie-one. But story is something what is building and if we are lucky to see 3 movies more about it...I can wait and let it build for some more to my liking.This was a bit too light and for-seeable how it goes plotwise but it was good still.What comes to 3D tech and visuals and effects...that alone I would give this movie like 15/10 points if only possible.Were Na'vi's the one who invented ""Navigator"" ? Or is it some reptile what lives there in Pandora?TIP: drop all imax etc...go watch it 3D.... I promise you won't regret.This one needs to be seen with 3D glasses on :) Amen."
"10* for VFX
3* for story
1* for length of the movie.Initial part goes thru very well and after sometimes it starts dragging endlessly. Many people in the movie theater can be seen moving around after sometime. Particularly after interval it is predictable with some out of the world flying vehicles, technology,guns,fire everything looks amazing because of VFX.It's a big torture to sit and watch this movie after sometime as it becomes predictable and length of the movie is a big let down.Movie ticket for this movie exorbitantly very high so no surprise it collected so much money at the box office."
"This movie is dumb..... and very enjoyable. I actually think the story is a little stronger then the first movie although it's pretty painfully obvious that James Cameron has dragged the setting to the area he's most comfortable in, underwater, and he's pulled out all the tools from his bag and liberally using aspects from The Abyss, Titanic, Aliens from the deep etc.No complaints with the casting really, and most of the characters have at least some depth and believability although some of characters had plot induced stupidity (one particular one is telegraphed but not quite earned and I guess more interactions between the characters in question were scripted but cute due to the very long running time)Only saw it in 2D but I am going to see it in 3d IMAX after xmas so it might just end up being mind-blowing like the first one was visually."
"This was a great movie, a bit too long for me but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The visuals were stunning of course and I particularly enjoyed watching the Sully family adapting to a new environment and even seeing the inspiration from Maori culture with the water people was so cool to see! I was in awe the whole time, I felt as though I could relate with Kiri in a sense that I was just overwhelmed by the beauty of the environment and how so highly regarded the ecosystem is on Pandora.However, even though I know it's a film and it isn't real the cruelty shown in this movie felt a bit too real and I was really disturbed by it. This doesn't impact how I rate the film but for people who really cannot watch films with animal cruelty or are distressed by environmental harm I will say it is hard to watch at times. I do still recommend, though."
"Avatar the Way of the Water builds on what Cameron had so successfully deployed in the first film; incredible visuals with a mediocre plot that tags along behind.This film is essentially the same film three times, in the first act the ""kids"" end up being Captured and have to be saved. This happens on the second and last Act as well.The design of the native Naavi and the incredible creatures is fantastic, they even seem to have thought about evolution, and each animal clearly shared a similar natural lineage. THAT is the details and design that makes AVATAR films so popular. However there are also some off design choices in the film. Kiri is a teenager in the film, having been adopted by Jake and Neytiri. Kiri is the somehow fatherless child of sigourney Weaver character in the first film (DR Grace) so naturally they choose her to play Kiri. However Weaver isn't a teenager in real life, she actually happens to be a 73 year old woman with a naturally deep voice. This just didn't work for me and although I liked Kiri as a character, Weavers performance really jarred me.Also the character Spider is an awful actor.Apart from that? It's a great watch."
"The long awaited sequel to the highest grossing film of all time has finally arrived, and it's great! I saw this film in 3D IMAX, and it is one of the best and most overwhelming experiences I have ever had. Everything that James Cameron did in the first film technically, is on a whole different caliber. My primary issue is the same one I had with the original Avatar, and that is the story. It's not bad at all, it's just very surface level. I'm not saying that all stories have to be complex, but when it come to this film it was a clear case of ""Style over Substance."" Avatar The Way of Water was absolutely worth the wait. Hopefully it does not take James Cameron as long to make the next one."
"Okay. So much waiting for this, I was disappointed. Certainly the images are beautiful, which makes it more of an animated film than an actor's film (there are still a few supporting humans to make the difference).The storyline is...flat at best. A lot of inconsistencies: a train attack which we don't know where it came from or where it is going since there is only a human base, and why this train is carrying weapons?, aircraft cockpits that you cross with arrows? Attackers (around thirty! For the big battle) on flying fish that disappear from the fight in the middle of it, children constantly disobedient in the middle of fights and without scratches (except one who dies, to make up for what I just said!) ...There are a lot of story holes and inconsistencies. After more than 10 years, I feel like the script was done in three days because there's nothing in it. No attachment to the characters, even Jack is now a coward and not too good a family man. I'm not even talking about the writers bringing back the bad Colonel, introducing his son (from where, who?), Sigourney's daughter or clone and them all surviving through this second film...In short, for me, apart from computer-generated images (which no longer represent a tour de force today since all films have them and it becomes indigestible), I prefer to forget this number 2 (and the following ones ). I don't think the success will be the same. Too bad."
"Avatar: The Way of Water (2022)James Cameron proves once again that he's the best action director and film innovator and one of the very few still relevant after 40 years of amazing film making.Visually, the movie is a stunning and manages to innovate once again. The CGI is flawless, especially considering the difficulty of everything involving water - and it's during the entire movie.I really like Sigourney Weaver as a young character - probably my favorite character - and the way Cameron found a good way to bring back characters who died in the first movie.I would say the weakest points of the movie are the plot (which partially rehashes the first movie) and the running time - you don't feel like watching a movie over 3 hours long but still it should have been a bit shorter. The final battle felt like dragging a bit too much.This movie should easily win an Academy Award for visual effects and if there's any justice, they should give Cameron the Oscar for direction that was taken from him for the first movie.I watched the movie in stunning 3D and couldn't tell which parts changed to HFR - it was flawless.I give this movie 8/10 for the visuals and 5.5/10 for the rest.7/10 Go watch it on the big screen in 3D HFR."
"Cameron's jumped the shark along with Lucas. This is Camerons Phantom Menace. Please end the madness of worshipping these over rated story tellers. No one will pop the inflated egos of these giant legendary directors so we keep getting this drivel. This movie sucked Period. Slow and uninspiring on all levels. A 5 because i like the color blue and I had a good nap. Probably should be a 3. One more to come too, OMG How much money has to be wasted. Please for the luv of all things decent and good tell this man to move on and tell a story we will remember. I don't care how revolutionary the movie technically is if i fall asleep. Avoid it you won't regret it."
"I'll admit, after about an hour and a half I was starting to get a little worried that this was just about world building, which, don't get me wrong was entertaining and did have some great moments to keep me interested, but the last hour to hour and a half saved this movie and more. The action sequences, emotions, cinematography, score, and so much more came together so incredibly to make a truly memorable movie. In my opinion it far surpassed the original and also sets up sequels really well, as we now know the characters better, and I'm excited to rewatch this before the third movie comes out."
"I cant believed we have to wait more than a decade long for a sequel. But well at least it's already here, and I am glad I watched another long Avatar film yet surprising underwhelming compared to the first one yet still satisfying to watch.This long satisfying sequel is great but not without shortcomings. I find things here on a smaller scale and less grandeur from the first movie despite showing us great new waters of Pandora. Yet it's story closely follows similar pattern as the first one. Yes, it's a sequel so it should be obviously but they should have made it not so obvious. Sadly it's story it lacks depth than the first one. This is just more of simple revenge story plot line to me and seems to be it will still be for another round.Nonetheless, Avatar Way of Water didn't disappoint us on showing another side of Pandora. It's spectacular looking great seas and underwater world of creatures. And that is why it is still the Avatar movie we all know from the first one.I wish 3 and 4 will be on a as much grandeur as the first one. And a more deeper story rather than a simple revenge story plot line. I really like seeing more of Pandora and their mysterious ways. I'm sure there will be after watching Way of Water, as it seem they are setting up a some strong bases on this sequel that are yet to be explored and explained in the coming sequels.More Avatar movie please..."
Well I watched late night show and man I am still not over it. Jaw-dropping VFX and live action sequences. Cameron keep the stroy simple with many future possibilities.Pandora is expanding with introduction of many new characters and their own personal touch. The core of the stroy sully stick together and fight together against any hurdles. In Avatar world Navi's are more emotional and civilized than the sky people (humans).The way James visualise pandora it is outof the box . Just go and watch and I don't remember when was the last time I don't feel like 3hour 12 min movie is too long.Masterpiece.
"Ok, so this is going to be a huge movie, and people will have it as their best ever movie lists, and LOVE it!I wasn't that excited after having seen the trailer, but off we went.I ended up dozing through a good chunk of the movie!I just don't care about Na'vi kids, families, nature and any of that stuff. Throw in some cliched characters and gung ho action movie americanisms and I'm even more bored.The visuals are of course super stunning.Once they finally get to the water, the visuals are next level.There are lovely messages about nature, The brutality of humanity and colonialism, family, friendship etc, but I really didn't care.The last hour actually was really exciting and action packed, so I left on a more positive note than the first two hours!My partner LOVED it. He was blown away by the visuals and nature, so that's all good.I know I will be a minority who wasn't that impressed, so don't let me put you off. I just wish they could have edited it into a tight 2 hour experience, instead of the never ending 3+hours that it was for me."
"It doesn't matter that the story isn't fantastic. That's not what we're here for. The story is a bystander to the magnificent visuals of this film.This film doesn't need a labyrinthine ternion of a story, because we're all here for the fantastic visuals on display. I went into the cinema today knowing that I was going to spend the next 3 hours marveling at the CGI in front of me, not following an interesting story.Yeah, the movie was a little cliché but: Hey! That's what I was expecting and it didn't matter. The movie was entertaining from beginning to end and will be one to remember and re-watch in the future."
"When the first avatar came, I was only 12 years old. It would take an astonishing 13 years for the next chapter to come to the big screen. After waiting for longer than I had existed when the first movie came, I must sadly say that I was waiting in desperation for a long time, only for a heart-wrenching letdown.Already from the beginning I could tell it wouldn't get the same feeling as the first Avatar. Quickly I found ""reused"" phrases and scenes remining me a bit too much of the first movie, but not in a good reminiscing way. This continues throughout the movie in the same manner. The beginning felt way to rushed and was setting up the rest of the movie with a poor-quality plot. With some ""plot holes"" and lazy writing. Whereas the first avatar was ""slowly"" grabbing the attention of the viewer, mesmerizing them, and sending the viewers mind on a great journey to Pandora, the way of the water fails to do so. I think the fast pace beginning with a slow middle part is partly to blame for this. You're immediately put into a state of worrying about the fate of the characters, the Na'vi and the feeling of disappointed when reuniting with old characters belonging to the past. This poor start destroys the feeling of exploring the wonders hiding on Pandora. Another reason for this lack of magical atmosphere is the soundtrack. The teaser trailer had a promising feeling of the soundtrack to the movie, as it immediately gave me goosebumps. However, this feeling is somewhat lost in the movie. I truly miss the magical works of James Horner. The movie did revisit some of the original soundtrack of Avatar, which in my opinion is one of the most iconic and mood setting soundtrack made to a movie. However, the newly added soundtrack to ""The way of water"" was at times unable to evoke emotions and in setting the mood. (Also why was ""the weeknd"" having a song at the movie credentials...? Give me some good Pandora typa feeling as I walk out of the cinema, please...)The lack of character development is shockingly bad, especially in Quaritch. I feel like they missed a huge opportunity in his character arch. When the decision on bringing him back came in the first place (which I think was a really bad decision), they could atleast given the character some development. The new avatar version of Quaritch which have his memories, could and should explored the opportunity to have its own personality. Even though the memories are there, the new Quaritch could have developed a sense of morality. Especially when he is seeing the world and sensing the world as an avatar, even getting his own Ikran and flying around Pandora. This could and should have been a turning point for his character, where he would develop an appreciation for Pandora and its natural way. I also think the casting of ""spider"" to be poor, with lacking acting abilities at times. His character also has his potential wasted and doesn't seem to be bothered at times about the human's treatment of the Na'vi or other creatures on Pandora. Spider was of course acting up sometimes of the treatment, but there were times when it was like they forgot he should be more distraught about ""his rase"" once again destroying the beauty of Pandora and causing misery to the Na'vi and people he was raised up with. It felt like he forgot to be ashamed of his own rase acions (even though he probably feels more like a Na'vi than human). I also think Neteyam should have gotten more screen time, so that the viewer would have been more thorn apart of the destiny that was laid upon him.I did rewatch Avatar in the cinemas earlier this year, as it had been many years since I last watched it. While watching i was continually gaping in astonishment and getting goosebumps all throughout the movie. I felt like a child again while watching and had tremendous feeling of joy on my way home from the cinema and in the weeks after. This was the same joy i felt after watching it for the first time as a child. I felt my passion for Avatar once again blooming. However little of this feeling have been replicated with ""The way of water"".The reason of my rating of the movie is purely because of the absolutely stunning visuals. The plot is astonishingly disappointing and generic, making me give it a 4/10, but the visuals are a 10/10. The movie did suffer at times from disastrous dialog and overuse of the word ""bro"". The ending with Jake and Neytiri connecting with Eywa was a heartbreakingly beautiful moment that leaves you in tears. This movie is a must see on the big screen and preferably in IMAX cinema or in 3D.From this point i elaborate more on my personal thoughts and hopes for the next movies. I hope that the next movies will be set back into the forest. The way of water however seems to set up atleast some of the movies or great parts of the future films to happend around water and the ocean. It did by all means look great in the movie, but it failed to explore more of the ocean and its different biomes to make it unforgettable. It failed to capture the allure and mysterious feeling the forest provided in the first movie. Not only do i hope to return to the forests of Pandora, but i think a movie set in the peaceful period between the first and second movie would be fantastic. You could move away from the generic ""human bad, human no moral, human destroy, poor Na'vi, long fight/war scene, Na'vi victorious and safe for now"" format, and rather continue to explore Pandora. This would allow us to get a better understanding of the Na'vi culture and interplay with nature, get to know characters better and see the upbringing of Jake's and Neytiris children. I can see how this idea could sound boring to some. However, with some decent writing, amazing cinematography, amazing sound and a fantastic soundtrack, this could have the audience moap throughout the movie and send chills down the spine. Making it more of a feel good movie that is unforgettable and iconic.Something else i am s bit staggered by is James Cameron's choice to wait for the technology to catch up before making the second movie. Now, I'm of course not sure how the rest of the story line will play out, but you could have easily rewritten the story to fit the technology available after the first movie. In the 13 years of waiting James Cameron could have either made avatar 2 and 3 set in the forest or some other terrestrial biome. Before making the 4 or 5 in the ocean to fulfill his own creative fantasies. Or have given us a stand-alone movie or like i mentioned above a movie set between the first and the second movie. It's kind of cruel to make the fans wait for such a long time only to have a generic story that anyone could have made."
"Simply overrated. I'm not quite sure what the big deal about this film series is as the first installment wasn't that great, but I found this film to be wasteful. I don't see a need to continue the series further. The characters aren't near as compelling as the propaganda suggests and the arrogance of James Cameron continuously stating how fantastic this film would be is a major turn off and opens the door, if you will, for nit-picking any and every detail embedded within the structure of this film. I found myself bored and lacking interest as the film progresses. Perhaps the most overhyped title of the century."
"I never released how few movies Cameron has actually directed but all of them are true cinema experiences. I wasnt old enough to see both the original Terminators or Aliens in the cinema but all 3 are certainly in my top movies. Titanic certainly is one of those films that will live on long after we are all gone and that how both of these Avatar movies will be remembered. To create firstly an enjoyable yet simple movie but also the hype around a sequel 13 years later proves Camerons place in Hollywood history.This is almost a play by play of the first movie but with the whole family instead of just Jake in the underwater world instead of the trees of the forest but this is one of the most spectacular movies to see in Cinema. I was in awe of the first movie whilst watching it, lately there was a rewatch and you do start to notice some of the limitations of the technology from 2009 whilst watching it in enhanced IMAX, this was the same feeling that i had 13 years ago that i couldnt see any faults in the design or technology. For that i can only herald this as a success. To make your budget back in 3 days... yes thats a success when the budget was over $400 Million.I cannot wait to see if theres a leep forward if we get to see Avatar 4 since 2 and 3 were filmed together back to back so rolled on 2024 when we get to see a conclusion to a trilogy that could go down in history. If the full 5 films get created then this can be placed firmly on the top self of movie franchise for quality over quantity."
"Twelve years ago on December 18th, 2009 James Cameron took the cinema world by storm with his cinematic masterpiece Avatar. Truly a theater going experience of a life time I saw that film over three times in IMAX 3D but finally after twelve long years Cameron releases Avatar: The Way of Water. Does it surpass its predecessor or blow it out of the water? (yes pun intended) to this question I say disappointingly no.I will get the obvious out of the way first, Avatar: The Way of Water much like the first film is a cinematic marvel! This film is beautiful and absolutely gorgeous. While returning to the traditional forests and mountains of Pandora was great the true beauty lies in its underwater world. The underwater sequences were absolutely stunning. I can only imagine how this film looked in IMAX 3D I'm sure it's incredible in any premium format.Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana return as Jake and Neytiri though they both take a backseat in favor of they're children. As for the children they were not strong enough to carry this film. Constantly getting themselves into trouble over, and over, and over again as well as never listening. Now granted this can be excused as they are kids who don't really know better and haven't had to face the threats Jake and Neytiri have. So I am slightly willing to give a pass here as long as Cameron realizes in the future these characters must be matured, I will only accept ""kids will be kids"" for so long and after what these kids went through I expect them to be matured in a third film.The return of Stephen Lang and Sigourney Weaver was wonderful they both gave great performances and I loved having the Colonel back he was a great villain in the first film and is a great villain again here. Sigourney Weaver plays Jake Sully's adopted daughter Kiri and I have to say she did so fantastically, how a 73 year old woman convinced me that she was a child is beyond me but she did it.Now to talk about the negatives. The story is just a recycled narrative of the first film and Cameron for some reason is content at just rehashing the same story beats throughout the entire second act. You did all this in the entirety of the first film so why are we doing this all over again. The third act is less a booming climatic battle but more of personal conflict and vendetta between Jake and the Colonel. Which wasn't bad because the story being told was more of a intimate story of family and the Colonels quest for revenge. But then what was the point of the sea people taking part in this ""battle"" they disappeared so fast. There's a clear indication of a grander conflict here but it's just not touched upon in favor of this personal conflict which would've been okay if it was resolved but it wasn't.Which was another draw back, the scope of a grander story is here but is just abandoned almost immediately. Perhaps this grander story will be picked up in the additional sequels Cameron has planned but unfortunately its just not used here. The first act in my opinion was the best this film had to offer, Cameron wasted no time in getting straight to business which I was incredibly grateful for. After about ten minutes of reintroducing Jake and Neytiri and introducing their kids we are immediately treated to the humans return and the ensuing conflict. Unfortunately due to the fast paced nature of the first act the explanation for their return is rather glossed over, like if you blick you miss it.Speaking of weak explanations, while I definitely enjoyed the return of Stephen Lang and Sigourney Weaver the explanation as to how was just soo... why? To me. I'd go into further detail but that is spoiler territory and I don't want to give anything more away as I feel I already have. Now the run time, I personally felt every minute of the 3 hours and 12 minutes admittedly that last 12 minutes is credits but still 3 hours is a longtime for what was the most part to me a rehash of things we already saw. I must say though the first hour of this film flew by as I was thoroughly entertained by the action but things slowed down immensely afterward when going into the second act.Lastly and this is more of a personal problem, James Cameron just has to bring something political and preachy here. More of his humanity is evil and the natives are good crap. The forced empathy for the sea people after seeing the aftermath of the whaling sequence was just annoying. It all came off as a poor ""save the whales"" message which was made pretty clear during said sequence. Anyway I just did not care as I rolled my eyes extensively to this weak forced sympathy attempt.Well this review really got away from me so I'll start wrapping things up. I was thoroughly hoping that this second viewing was going to help maintain my score but it just lowered it because of the story repeats of the first film, a rather lackluster final act, a overbloated run time, and of course Cameron's typical political, preachy nonsense I have to say it was just average to slightly below average.Second viewing thoughts:
I want to take this chance outside my review to mention the 3D and HFR (High Frame Rate) experience. The 3D format is second to none, it elevated all the spectacular visuals to booming heights. Also the 3D technology added a layer of immersion to the underwater sequences I have never experienced in a cinema. Now throw in higher frame rates with this 3D and it is just stunning! The high frame rate made everything look soo smoth, it was gorgeous and because of the immense cgi usage in this film the high frame rate made the 48fps (Frames Per Second) sequences look like a video game and I loved every minute of it. I yearn for the day video games can look as good as this film does. Unfortunately the transitions between the standard 24fps and 48fps was at times unnatural and made for a bit of a turn off.This second viewing also just highlighted this films shortcomings particularly in the story department, while a first viewing things were more tolerable this second viewing just made everything I was slightly annoyed by to being extremely annoyed by. The children are just stupid and not at all that interesting and because of the recycled story it made the 3 hours unbearably long.At the end of the day I firmly believe this film is only getting high scores because of fantastic visuals and James Cameron. A terribly boring story, and a run time that is completely unnecessary makes this beautiful mess of a film extremely average, but because it's been a long time since Avatar it recieves eights, nines, and tens. Well James Cameron isn't getting a pass from me.By the end of the film I was just extremely disappointed even more so than my first viewing. While the 3D technology and HFR affect carry things to amazing heights, you can't just rely on amazing technology to make a good film. Now because my score for this second viewing was so dependent on the 3D, HFR format I'm going to have to for the first time in my reviews give two different scores.2D non HFR:
IMDb: 4/10
Letterboxd: 2/53D w/ HFR:
IMDb: 5/10
Letterboxd: 3/5Watched in Theaters."
"Avatar is not a great movie. It is too long, lacks meaningful story, and has some significant fluff plots. That being said, the visuals are the best to ever reach the big screen and the character work was actually really solid. The latter I was more impressed with than the former because I did not expect it.I knew that this would be a technical masterpiece, and for the most part it was. However, I had heard that there would be a frame rate increase compared to normal movies. This was music to my ears as watching movies in theatres generally dampens the experience to me because 30fps with motion blur looks like a slideshow during a lot of scenes. I was surprised to see that Avatar did not fix this at all, and when characters were doing anything on land where the camera was panning or a character crossing the screen horizontally it was quite jarring. The future of cinema is 120fps. I have no idea what technical limitations would need to be broken to do that but as audiences who grew up with competent gaming systems and PCs age, they will be less and less accepting of this eye sore."
"Anybody who rates this below an 8 should be banned from posting on IMBD permanently. Really, a 1 from over 2% of the reviewers? That's ridiculous. The visuals alone are stunning. Whatever else is true of James Cameron, and yes, he is insufferable, he does know action and the power of the big screen. So many younger viewers have no understanding of the impact he has made upon action movies. Just watch action movies before the first Terminator move and Aliens. Those 2 movies took action to a much higher level than the movies before. As for understanding the power of the big screen, he's shown himself to be an expert with Titanic and the 2 Avatar movies. Yep, some of this movie was predictable, but wow, what a ride. Keep making movies, James Cameron."
"I can not find the the words to express how much I loved this movie, I loved everything about it. Those 3.20 hours passed like it was 30 minutes i was completely and utterly drawn into the universe. Iost track of time and place. It has to be the best cinema experience I've ever had do to sound and absolutely amazing picture/grafics not to forget about the best 3D work I've seen so far. It just works. To say the least the acting is amazing it must be hard doing this intire movie by green screen like how do they do it so convincing? The story we have all seen many times before but it honestly really doesn't matter . Cause the execusion all over is next level from picture to sound to acting."
"James Cameron once again proved his worth with this spectacular masterpiece. The visuals are mind-blowing and kept you immerse in the beautiful world of Pandora till the end, I honestly didn't realise that the clock already hit 3 hours while watching this beautiful movie. The action scenes at the start can be more intense and I felt that they were short needs a little bit of improvement but the finale is breath-taking and in 3D it's almost like you were there and from my perspective they should've included additional creatures in forest scenes because first 50 mins felt like experiencing almost the same 2009 Avatar, But the way of water OMG the cinematography, the Visuals & the creatures are just spectacular. Overall this movie will let you dive deep into the Aquatic world of Pandora and I am eagerly waiting for the other 3 parts as I want to explore more Pandora beauty."
"As expected the movie is visually gorgeous, you can feel how passionate Cameron was in making the milieu of Pandora and what lies beneath the water.However, the movie is seriously lacking in writing department. Plot is highly predictable and corny. Dialogue is at some parts so terrible that it cuts through any tension or immersion the movie might have built by this point. Crying at loud, in the movie na'vi kids said 100+ times ""bruh"", ""bro"" and I believe I even heard couple of ""cuhs"". Due to terrible screenplay it is almost impossible to judge whether avting was good or not, actors were deffinitely handed great chances to succeed.Also pacing was was off between acts and thematically tone switched too much. And finally, I believe movie should have been at least one hour shorter.All in all I feel that the movie is visual spectacle that lacks in almost all other components."
"Not entirely sure where to start with this. But it's obvious to say though that the visual effects were magnificently gorgeous and I owe a hats off to the visuals effects team themselves for all the hard work they did on every detail of everything! THAT is only the reason it is even getting 5 stars....luckily....Compared to it's predecessor, which kept the game simple, this one just has too much scrambled eggs together of things that make absolutely zero sense, cliches that we've already seen from other things before, with a bunch of overdone ""bonding"", drugged eye candy to where eventually your eyes get tired of looking at everything, a rehash of everything that happened in the first one, and top of all that, ZERO depth to anything. Which basically means zero emotional depth and you just don't care about anyone it seems. Zero story. If I could even call it a story itself, but sitting there watching a bunch of creatures fly, swim, crawl, etc is not a story. This could've been a completely different story and it probably would've been pretty solid with a different formula. Great visuals alone DO NOT MAKE A GREAT MOVIE. So agonizingly long too. Easily could've been 2 hours or less. My goodness. I was about to shoot myself.It's crazy to believe we waited 13 years for something to turn out not so quite good unfortunately. Not the sequel that we wanted. You would think for that long of a time, that they could've came up with a completely strong narrative, and an engaging storyline. They had PLENTY of time for rewrites and discussions. How did James Cameron not see that so many things were missing in this? Seems he went too far into his world of things and pretty much ignored everything else. Seems to me they gave him the right ideas or idea, but he just threw it away and instead wanted to focus on only Pandora. And I bet ya that is exactly what happened! His ego really led him astray.I think it goes to show that he forgot how to make narratives. And by all means, he is a fantastic director, but after seeing this? I don't know man, I think his time might need to be done. I just don't see how anyone can be so excited for the other Avatar movies to come. Because I'm absolutely not...I know...ouch.Avatar, your time is done. It's Game Over."
"Avatar or James Cameron's Avatar - One of my favourite movies of all decades. After a long time, the team or crew is back with a magically visual treat. I liked this film so much and don't know how to describe. Highly recommended for friends and viewers of this review - should watch in 3d only. The best part of the movie is the climax when the whale like creature have emotions and uses his/her brain to fight out the enimies. It was perfect. No any other words to say. Should watch in theatres and never miss a theatre experience. Shouldn't wait to release on online streaming service. The best of the year 2022."
"Avatar: The Way of Water (2022) directed by James Cameron is a testament to his legacy of film making and his ambitious Avatar franchise.I had very little to anticipate for Avatar: The Way of Water as I believe the original Avatar (2009) is a beautiful film in its own right and should be perceived that way. In spite, I was looking forward to experiencing the sequel thirteen years later in 2022.The story takes place years after the events of the original Avatar film, where Jake Sully now lives with his family on Pandora. Then, once a familiar threat returns to finish what was previously started, in the form of the evil humans wanting to hunt down Jake, he must work with Neytiri, his four children, and the army of the Na'vi race to protect their home.All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by Cameron's latest achievement. The expected visual spectacle is definitely in focus and it is astonishing to look at with beautiful cinematography (although not nearly as revolutionary as in 2009).Another strength of the film was the theme of family, which I found quite moving and emotionally charged during several scenes. I found the story to be wonderfully told and well-paced, and although clicking in at well over three hours, I did not find it excessively long. I highly recommend it for its entertainment value and as being a worthy follow-up to the original and in my opinion unbeatable original Avatar film from 2009."
"POSITIVES:1) This is the most beautiful film I have ever seen. It was absolutely mind blowing at times and I literally couldn't take my eyes off the screen for the full runtime. Incredible work from James Cameron and his team. Cameron really cements his status as a true cinematic visionary here
2) The film is a lot more action packed than the first one and certainly benefits from that. The first hour and the last hour especially were so full of action that had me completely locked in and engaged
3) The film does a really good job of making me care about all of the new characters it introduces. This is especially true of Jake's four children, but also extends to characters like Spider too. Kiri is definitely the standout, but I'm excited to see what happens next for all of the characters
4) I don't think of the score as being very memorable in the first film, but I thought the score was brilliant and very memorable in this filmNEGATIVES:1) The film retreads too many plot threads from the first film for me. I never really got on board with Quaritch being brought back in the first place, but then when he was saved again at the end I really rolled my eyes because I don't want him as the antagonist for a third film in a row. Also on this point, the fact that we yet again go through the plot thread of Jake having to learn and adapt to a new culture was quite tiresome. The scenes of understanding the water tribes really grind the pacing of the film to a halt and should have been cut down dramatically, which would bring the overall runtime to a much more manageable under three hours
2) The whale-hunting human characters were SO annoying and completely unnecessary. The acting was terrible and the characters honestly had me clenching my fists - SO annoying and barely even serve any purpose to the story."
"I did not watch the movie for the story. In that aspect it's very lacking, don't expect to be blown away by the weight of the drama going on in this movie. It's kept at a certain level and it doesn't really exceed that to be honest. It's more of the same throughout the whole movie. Family. And family that is kept hostage (first in the forest and then at the last battle) and stuff happens around these events. I think this movie is more of a setup for more to come, than it is really to blow us away with the story and the characters involved.Now the technology used for this movie is a whole other area. James Cameron has outdone himself again when it comes to this. I watched the movie how it's intended to be watched: high refresh rate (48/60fps rather than the traditional 24/30fps), 3D, 4K Laser Projection and Dolby Atmos sound. IMAX with laser projection will also do it justice. I've been blown away by this movie regarding that. I felt truly immersed into the world of Pandora, like I could touch things. Normally 3D is a gimmick, but in this movie it finally earns some recognition again. This is why cinemas exist, to go beyond what's possible on television. This is why you have to see this movie in the theatres, it's just showing what's possible on the big screen.The underwater scenes and the hour long battle at the end certainly help showcasing that. I will definitely rewatch this movie very soon."
"Spoiler alert: The fist Avatar was one of the best movies of all time. Especially because of the empowering story, that it is possible to be victorious over evil and also because of the beautiful imagery and the spiritual qualities.The second Avatar has also beautiful imagery, but the story is the opposite. The bad people come back, take over the planet and kill Jack's son. And all this is happening within a gigantic war between the indigenous and the foreign people. Then the story is basically over. Leaving you with a sense of, there is no escape from war. War is something that must occur. Perfectly in alignment with the global agenda of the deep state and their constant programming of the human mind into negativity.Also it portrays many more tribes living on the planet which are not friendly at all between the tribes, but rather show quite human like traits such as derogatoriness, aggressiveness, and closed mindedness. Lacking the spiritual and holistic qualities that were highlighted in the first movie beautifully.Then they also show imagery of the bad people burning down some of the tribes villages as a pure act of aggressiveness and disgust, while in search for their chosen enemy, Jack. Could not fathom what was the point of these scenes.Overall this movie left my wife and I with a bitter sad taste and quite disempowered. As if there is no other option than greed and destruction will always win at the end.Total disappointment.Maybe there is an Avatar 3, where these things can be fixed and there is some sort of redemption."
"I gave this movie a 10 mostly because in regards to an unforgettable cinematic experience that visually takes you places you've never seen before, it gets top marks. Even with the Weakest script James Cameron has written it still delivers like no other.It feels like going on safari to a beautiful planet that actually exists and also a theme park ride.The action is well choreographed with huge stakes.Jake Sullys family are a loveable clan who I cared about by the end, and even Quarrich was elevated from a 1 dimension evil villain to someone with depth.I'll be watching this as many times as possible in the theatre."
"Don't expect people to be easy on a sequel that took 13 years to come out.As the usual, Cameron submerges us once again in top-of-the-class special effects that eventually makes you forget Pandora is not real. The effort that was put in making little details, textures, sounds and light flares is evident and very well done.But then, if you were thinking that Avatar 2 would follow Terminator 2, as a successful sequel, this is not the case.For starters, the movie is half an hour longer than the original. Which necessarily needs to fill out a lot of spaces with situations that in this case were mere superfluous and meh. It was hard to see developed characters, there was excessively obvious situations and predictive climaxes that turned away the interest in the plot, if there's one to analyze. There wasn't one interesting dialogue between the characters like we saw in the fist movie. Something I found awkward was Cameron not defining with enough contingency wether the movie should be narrated by an omnipresent narrator or not, so he cames out speaking in certain points so very separated from each other to the point we forgot there was even a narrator.Spoilers ahead.How is even possible that humanity in the XXII century is able to travel across the stars but still not able to produce an anti-wooden-arrow wind shields for their ships? Hard to accept.But that's just only one of the missing pieces. The big ones come when everything unfolds in the movie just like a Latinamerican telenovela: the bad guy was resurrected. Had a child. The child is one of the good guys but at the end of the movie, not too much anymore. Doctor Grace Augustine was pregnant when she died. How convenient, who's the father? Another missing piece.An then, they manage to bring back to life so many characters (but not Dr. Augustine) that at the end it just not make any sense to kill one of the main ones, like Sully's elder son. We were all expecting him to be resuscitated either by Eywa or human tech, but instead, he just died and I believe, the director wanted us to drop the tear here but mainly, there was frustration sentiments in exchange. There is also this twisted English-accent antagonist that was more funny than evil.Goodall' first movie scientists only had a literally 10 seconds spot on the movie. Why not give them more credit in a 3-hour-long movie? What are they still doing in Pandora? Remember all humans were expelled from the planet in the fist movie? How come they still got the base camp and all tech running like if they had technical support and maintenance?Let's not forget Sully,s children speak like any California's suburb highschool groupies. Like 'hey bro', 'ok cuz'.Finally, there is no more need to fight over Unobtanium. The substance worth 80 million the litter is some yellow gooey substance squeezed off one of the most intelligent creatures on Pandora, a whale, that if it was that smart, why so easy to hunt?In a nutshell: very long, no developed dialogues, no mystery in the plot, very obvious situations and convenient resurrections, narrator or not?, unfair with old characters and corny new ones like the English bad guy."
"Possibly one of the worst films ever to be made. Solely about making millions of dollars. It's literally about a big fish. No twists , no storytelling, no point to be honest. James Cameron is a terrible storyteller!! He should retire and never be allowed to make any film ever again.Films that are great... shawshank, gladiator, the departed, casino, just to name a few..
this film is absolutely awful. It's the only film in history that made me want to go back to the cinema and stand outside with a sign saying...""I'll pay you not to see it""Unfortunately Bad Critics will rate this film highly! It's nothing more then CGI rubbish.Please please please.. do not line James Cameron with more money in his pocket !! Avoid at all measures ... Covid was better then this !"
"Wow, look at all those 10's. No review. Its probably review proof. Just some observations. James cameron loves sinking ships. Apparently. He also likes to repeat himself. The ending literally happens twice in the last 90 minutes. So nice you get to see it twice. I guess we must be pretty dumb. Also, the bad guys in both avatar films are really, really stupid. No matter how much fire power they possess, they still get done in with bows and arrows. And children. The story, such as it is, is pretty similar to the last movie. A coincidence, i guess. Apparenlty in the avatar universe the more of the same the better. Knock yourself out."
"The story and the relationships don't work. The movie doesn't make me care about them and so I am not invested in their journey. Fury Road had much better relationships and it did it with less time and fewer words.The character arcs don't work either. No real learning happens and the characters just wander from one scene to the next.The antagonist doesn't work either. The central conflict feels artificial.The fight scenes are not interesting because I don't care about the characters and they are confusing.Boring boring boring Movie , 2,5 houers lost of Tim 1/2 houder action. Sentimentel crap."
"There have been many attempts to film Herman Melville's Moby-Dick; or, the Whale. Some, like the 1998 tv miniseries with Patrick Stewart, have made a more earnest effort to stay faithful to the source material, but they all are ultimately disappointing because the task itself is a fool's errand. Moby-Dick was a novel written in 1851 American English; a movie--and try to look beyond the obviousness of what I'm saying--can never be a novel written in 1851 American English. A movie made in 2022 can only ever be a movie made in 2022, and so Avatar: The Way of Water--stay with me--may be the closest will we ever get to a spiritual adaptation of Moby-Dick to film that can speak to us in the same way that Melville hoped to speak to his contemporaries.By saying this, I don't mean that this sequel to Avatar is an attempt to adapt Moby-Dick to the big screen, although clearly the mid-film scenes of hunting ""tulkuns"" in order to harvest the extremely valuable liquid inside of them were directly inspired by scenes from that book. What I mean more than that is that The Way of Water has the same feeling, the same composition, and overall some of the same messages as Melville's novel. In crafting Moby-Dick, Melville was able to pull together all the influences that his audience would have been very familiar with: Biblical scripture and Great Awakening oratory, the iambic pentameter of Shakespeare, protoevolutionary scientific literature, bloody adventure tales mythologizing the lucrative whaling industry, anthropological ethnologies, and so on. The chapters are written differently to reflect these different discourses, and often his keen observation treats them with satirical distance, albeit a biting satire that one can easily mistake for sincerity. Cameron would be a fool to incorporate the same influences into his twenty-first century film, so instead he draws from the sources that we are more familiar with: the nature documentary, the ecological disaster film, the militaristic action blockbuster, the coming-of-age, star-crossed romance, and the outsiders/outcasts-banning-together sci-fi parable. In many cases, Cameron has already made masterpieces in these genres, so he's also evoking his own oeuvre. He knows the language of cinema just like Melville knew the language of literature, and he can distill each form to the essences that make them endure. The averted glance of a teenager in love, the horror of a destroyed environment, the thrill of a battle between high-tech machines and oppressed freedom fighters--Cameron has been filming all that for years, and he does so extremely well.Cameron's reckless disregard for conventional storytelling structure also parallels Melville's. Moby-Dick will end a chapter with two gossiping sailors ending their secret conversation because they see the villain approaching with ""something bloody on his mind,"" only to begin the next chapter with thirty pages of taxonomic classification of whale species. Cameron's 192-minute movie likewise will juxtapose an intimate family scene against an abrupt battle sequence; will show us that the villains are inching closer toward having the upper hand only to then linger on children admiring the seascape for fifteen minutes. This was very jarring and off-putting to me at first, but once I learned to embrace the experience as being something beyond my complete comprehension and control, I surrendered to a feeling akin to believing the stories in the Book of Genesis. This was mythic storytelling that was going to place me in vivid moments of an imaginary realm. Unlike the original Avatar, there are no exposition dumps nor any carefully choreographed structure signposting how one scene leads to the next. Instead, when you learn that there is a human fishing crew operating in the oceans of Pandora, you are simply supposed to expect that this world is much larger and more complicated than you initially assumed. The original Avatar seemed small and artificial to me, but this version of Pandora comes across as a vast, immersive, fully realized world with many different people in it.Melville faced technological progress with wonder yet also fear, questioned the power of authority to dangerously oversimplify while nevertheless succumbing to the awe that authority and prowess evokes, and celebrated the differences among individuals, species, and cultures while also embracing their potential to bond together over their similar interests. Melville showed masculinity in all its dangerous, fragile, and inspiring forms. Avatar: The Way of Water does many of the same things in a way that speaks to modern filmgoers.Cameron has made a film that greatly surpasses the original. Just like Melville took the nineteenth-century American novel to its most experimental and essential form, Cameron has given us a film that showcases twenty-first-century filmmaking in its highest and most consummate capacity. This is more of an experience than a mere movie, and it should be experienced under the best possible conditions, i.e. 3D IMAX, by anyone interested in seeing a sci-fi master using cutting edge technology to transcend reality and take us deep into his imaginative dreams."
"What a waste of time and money. This movie is a big rubbish in every aspect. No compelling story , no acting and no direction.Family drama of bollywood with touch of titanic and aquaman. Was is a kids movie?I rate this movie a 1 star just for some visuals, though copy pasted from other movies. 0 star for story . 0 star for direction. 0 star for acting. -5 star for unnecessary long length of the movie.They destroyed spiritual concept of the movie. Way Too much action and killing unnecessary. Very boring movie.Why was this movie made? I wish this movie was never out.I need my money back."
"I knew to lower my expectations for James Cameron's sequel for iconic Avatar, especially after over a decade since first one. But here it just didnt feel the same or have same ""wow"" factor. Sure the landscapes were beautiful and outstanding, an the underwater scenes, but lacked plot-wise. It was mistake to have the focus on Jake's kids when I cared about og characters more. And why reveal the come back of colonel when they couls have saved that as a plot twist in the end. Only new character I liked was their daughter Kiri, but left many to unanswer for (for a reason, to be answeres in other films)."
"After a long long wait we finally get the next avatar movie. 13 years and the movie truly delivers with some amazing visuals, pretty great score and good sound design. The cast delivers adequate performances and the movie has a very rich and unique feel to it.However the unbelievable inadequacy presented by the obvious incapability of the screenwriter to come up with anything coherent is even more stunning than any VFX moneyshot in the movie.Characters do stupid stuff for no reason. Why does the military care about Jake Sully specifically instead of the camps that actually stop them from easily expanding on Pandora? Why didn't Jake do ANY preparation for the inevitable return of the people. Why is unobtainium not even mentioned. How does a plane travel hundreds of kilometres faster than the threatened individual being brought to the tribe's medic. Why wouldn't the na'vi be using the breath-giving-underwater-things like all the time?It's insultingly insufferable to watch. See it with no sound and subtitles and pretend it's a Nat Geo Wild documentary so thay maybe you get some enjoyment from this ridiculous garbage pile."
"Everything else I feel about this movie (great visuals, bad plot/characters) has been said by others. But one thing I was really disappointed by which no one seems to mention is the music. As a supporting background theme, it was great. But to make me really feel like in a different world like with Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, or Dune lately, it was totally lackluster. I don't remember a single moment where I enjoyed a nice theme that I appreciated. The only ones were from the first movie, which are great, but they played like once each and nothing new music wise. There's one song, but that's pretty mediocre and not catchy at all."
"Director Cameron had over 10 years to come up with this stale stuff - common.....where is the high concept? There wasn't much. Yes the water environment was spectacular to look at and creature designs were very good, but we're left with more gun fights and humans shot with arrows on top of a bad Australian. And then there's the whole military lingo which wears equally thin. ""engage"", ""2-clicks"" ,""Lima Charlie"" ""Whoo-raw"", ""Get some""....and more. Aside from the visuals, ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" doesn't rise above its predecessor, and its longer, badly longer. Give a 6/10. A ""meh"" story, just playing it safe and by the numbers with a cliched repeat of the 1st movie. Disappointing - yes."
"Avatar 2 is what the true cinematic experience is all about. If you are planning to watch Avatar: TRUE CINEMA, Avatar 2 is what the true cinematic experience is all about. If you are planning to watch Avatar: The Way of Water on your home screen, then you are eluding yourself from experiencing something truly great. It's not another heartless cash-grabbing sequel, this time the story was full of emotion and so ardent that it is sure to bring tears to a few eyes. The first was a technological breakthrough that broke new ground in 3D technology, and its CGI still stands the test of time. The sequel may not be known as another technological triumph, but 13 years of research and development in mocap technology did go into it. But this time the story is something that comes into focus elevated with Cameron's filming technology. He is more of a scientist than a director to me. This sequel wasn't made as soon as it was greenlit, as they made sure the script was their strong suit this time around, which shows in the world-building aspect and the story arc the character goes through, which definitely took a true visionary to write. If you got to experience it in a PVR or an IMAX theater, you've earned the right to brag. The profit margin for this movie is too high so I don't care if it's termed a flop in the end, but in many cases it has surpassed its predecessor. It will be a shame if we don't get to see James Cameron's vision unfold due to the unrealistic (maybe) 2 billion dollar grossing limit just to break even Way of Water on your home screen, then you are eluding yourself from experiencing something truly great.

"AVATAR: THE WAY OF WATER (2022) *** Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang, Kate Winslet, Cliff Curtis, Joel David Moore, CCH Pounder, Edie Falco, Brendan Cowell, Jermaine Clement, Jamie Flatters, Britain Dalton, Trinity Jo-Li Bliss, Jack Champion. Filmmaker James Cameron's return to the fold of Pandora with Jake Sully and his new family facing an old foe in the reincarnated avatar form of Quaritch (Lang in subdued menacing form) faces off by taking his brood to the water world of the aquatic Neytiri against the odds of survival without a full-scale war breaking out. The visual f/x are beyond words marvelous and need to be seen in IMAX to appreciate the groundbreaking CGI technology as well as the motion-captured performances in spite of the somewhat bloated run-time."
"When Avatar came out in 2009 it was truly a technical and cinematic achievement. There's a reason why it was the highest grossing movie of all time Avengers: Endgame came along.With Avatar: Way of Water, Everything has been upgraded. The story, the graphics, the sound, the cast, the acting, you name it.We get to see more of the massive wondrous world of Pandora in an absolutely immersive experience. The CGI looks so good 90% of the time it felt like watching real footage shot on a high quality camera.If possible watch this is a 4DX theatre, the wind and rain effects add a lot to the experience (not to mention the seats moving). 3D glasses also help, plenty of scenes work well with it.As expected this leaves you with a deep respect for nature and all it has to offer. While there are few truly evil characters in the movie, it really highlights how people can end up doing some very bad things without even thinking about it. Gives you a new perspective on how we treat the environment and why it's important to conserve it.All in all a very well deserved 10 stars. Should have known from the title and trailer but it would end with the setup for another movie. Can't wait for the sequel!"
"I needed this movie to be reminded of why it makes such a difference to go watch something in the theaters, I've seen better movies before but I will risk to say that this particular film was probably one the best cinematic experiences I had.I have never seen such beautiful imagery specially being crafted exclusively though digital mechanisms, the 3D, the IMAX and the 60 FPS, I make no exaggeration when I say it really seemed I was living on Pandora.Avatar: The Way of Water is visually stunning, its use of motion capture and computer-generated imagery (CGI) is breathtaking, with lush environments and creatures that are truly believable and the attention to detail in the film helps to create an immersive and credible world.Every detail seems to be masterfully crafted and yes similar to the first one the story might not be a groundbreaking plot yet it's interesting enough and it matches the entire atmosphere perfectly.I usually criticize movies that are all about the style and no substance but in this sequel there is actually a lot of substance, not necessarily in the story itself but on the crucial messages of preservation, environmentalism and the consequences of exploiting natural resources that are depicted throughout.I feel that it makes this statement on a very beautiful fashion with breath taking imagery that will transport you to a different reality during the time you are in that movie theater.I am glad movies like this revive the true meaning of a cinematic experience and there is no best time to get back and experience this art in its original and truest form."
"You know i will keep it short.People saying shallow, not a new story, more water need to see that this movie is the middle part of the entire story. It needs to be long, visually terrific, trustworthy and protagonist family plays a big part in it only because of above mentioned reasons. And , I am in for it. M writing this review after a lot of consideration even from a normal viewer , yes from their point of view it is indeed long if they consider Netflix movies as only movies. Cinema has changed and so have viewers. Some of the underwater adventure/exploring scenes of new generation should have been edited.Puting aside all the visual appreciation & vfx ,Many characters from this particular movie are new , & so will be confused as the universe grows. Some with powers , some with trauma , some with love . Plus the engineering aspects in Cameron's movies were always fantastic! I wish we could have more space shots , pages from comics (Avatar : high ground) but
Despite it all
I found no errors, James played it safe with reasons visible & some unknown. I myself enjoyed it because of its grandeur world building of old school sci-fi story except the (cringy mcu theorem of kids doing impossible stuff , superheroes tearing half of the planet to save a girl , 70s rock or new hiphop playing with dodgy vfx ) Yes! Exactly. Something new of a science fiction in a big screen, finally!"
"As another reviewer said earlier:
the plot is so predictablethe dialogue is simpleno significant acting (apart maybe from the main actress as some points)the reality/logic is loose many times (yes, it's a sci-fi but apart of some very defined things, it can still remain realistic, this movie crosses that line many times)lots of cheesy stuff... but still it's good!Two reasons:1) cinematics, yes, watch it in the best possible quality, it worth it!2) the movie manages for a second time (after avatar 2009) to give a strong environmental message, in a fashion that is attractive and easy to understand by everyone."
"J. Cameron, wandering around his virtual set in headgear, forgot some of his own tenets. Basically re-inventing stereoscopic filmmaking, Cameron has made huge strides, initially saying, ""use fewer cuts and no shortcuts."" This is animation history in 2009: BeforeAvatar, AfterAvatar. Even moreso in 2022. Now they fine-tune motion-capture. I think they used too much motion-blur, but it matters how far the viewer is from the screen.James Cameron proceeded to make THE most- violent movie I have ever seen(!). While I'm a long-in-tooth action-movie fan (and animator), it will be years before I take any child to see this...... yes, it's a visual milestone. And maybe toooo realistic for anyone under 10years old."
"A few years ago when I finished watching Avatar at home in 3D, I felt regret for not getting to watch it in cinemas. Well, 2009 was the year I barely started going to cinemas, so I kinda excused it. Now, years later, I found out about Avatar: The Way of Water running in cinemas, and I told myself: I am NOT missing it this time! And as I watched the film this afternoon, I found myself mesmerized and transported to the beautiful world of Pandora, in 3D.Mind you, I watched the film in Hindi as the English version was neither affordable nor playing in 3D. And being a lover of 3D films, I had to make sure I experienced it in this format. This experience, to be honest, was otherworldly. There's NO part in the film where I didn't exclaim ""wow"". Plus, the best and the most unexpected surprise was the frame rate. The action sequences felt outstanding in 48 fps and this was a one-of-its-kind experience. And while I do agree this film did feel long a few times, I also can assure you there's no dull or boring moment present anywhere. The film has a very strong emotional core, due to which there were moments I almost shed a tear.The first two acts of the film move at a casual pace, but without any boredom. We are introduced to a new world of water, which with its stunning picturization holds our attention. The family drama plays out well, and the overall message of togetherness in all circumstances resonates even till the last frame. By the time the final act arrives, the film delivers a heavy dose of explosive action, including moments that will make you cheer with excitement!Avatar: The Way of Water is an epic film both in terms of length and presentation, and I'm glad it's close to 3 hours long, because it's meant first and foremost for the cinemas. And James Cameron and team make sure you have the best time watching it. This sci-fi action epic is a masterpiece and definitely worth a watch. Just buy your tickets and watch it theatrically in 3D already. Enough said."
"I kept wanting to look at the time to see how many more hours we had to put up with this same rehash of Avatar 1, now trying to drown our sorrows
Bored except for the 3D effects, it was hard to follow each of the characters and why really any of this was going on. Our world is on the edge of extinction but let's spend mega bucks on extracting this whale juice that extends the life of mankind, and in the meantime, seek vengeance on Jake just because he deserves it.And now let's kill the whales, use kids as hostages during endless violence in the war and have New Zealand Maori culture as the culture of a non human species on a distant planet."
"So saddened that Avatar II wasn't more engaging, The dialogue was poor. The storyline is poor.I was eagerly awaiting the release and left 2 hours in. And I have never left a film before the ending!!! The exquisite graphic animation, digital imagery is seamless, beautiful. The underwater scenes are truly glorious however even the magic for my eyes wasn't enough to keep me in my seat.Now I loved the first Avatar and I love James Cameron's work. But this effort seems as though he phoned it in. I am sorry to say it too. I am not hopeful for the remaining segments.One thing is certain, I won't be going to the theater for another Avatar flick!"
"James Cameron does it again. Creates a beautiful, vibrant world with a basic, paint by numbers plot. If someone had stepped in and cut this movie an hour shorter, we might have been okay but instead I was getting bored, checked my watch and saw I still had 45 minutes to go.Is the world beautiful? Yes, absolutely. Does the adjusted frame rate work? No, action scenes feel like a cut scene from a video game. How's the story? Mediocre. The overarching story gets lost and forgotten because James Cameron wants to paint the whole world. As he does that, he fills it in with random cliché side plots to distract you until you remember, oh yeah, there's a big bad villain out there. The story feels like something my 6 year old niece would write. Bouncing from one thought to the next.Rough synopsis: Oh the *Insert character/Group* is in trouble! Lets go save them. How could you do that? You know better. Here's a beautiful CGI thing to look at. Rinse/repeat.Major themes carry over from the first one. Humanity is bad except for ""our"" white savior. He's the good guy. Here's a new group of Navi that don't trust us at first but they'll come around after a scary moment.The story feels like Cameron kept adding on one story trope after another and no one walked into the room to knock the pen out of his hand. If you end up watching it, do yourself a favor and get up to pee halfway through. Grab some popcorn and a drink. Maybe taking a break from Pandora will make it not so insufferably long."
"First of all shut up to everyone that rates this movie a 1/10, it is impossible not to like this movie. I do not understand that people find it disturbing that the film is 3 hours, this film remains beautiful and exciting. I can watch 10 hours of this, the 3 hours feels like half an hourThe special effect and the cinematography are simply stunning, this film shows the art of film and is a masterpiece.The storyline and the acting is just not normally beautiful.The film shows a different kind of na'vi than the first film, it makes the movie 10 times more wonderful because it happens a lot underwater."
"I went in the cinema with very few expectations to be honest with you. The first Avatar was great at the time considering the technology involved but the plot wasn't amazing crazy. So on Avatar 2 I went in prepared to take a nap here and there but guess what, this one is amazing. So much better than the first movie. The plot was much better than the first one and for some reason it felt a little bit personal, I don't know why but it just did.There are couple of things however that bother me : Why Neytiri was involved so little? It feels like she was popping up every now and then to say couple of lines and then dissapears. I feel like she deserved to be involved more in the plot.And second : Where did all the rest of the Navi dissapeared during and after the final battle ? Like all of them went into the battle and all of the sudden was basically only Jake's family ?"
"Avatar the way of water is an acceptable sequel to the original, but definitely is a different kind of movie then the first. It is much more family oriented which can be good if that's what you're looking for - but that is not the case for me.There was just the feel from the start where the chief accepted a known danger to his people which threw me off for the entire film. Why would you let a known fugitive that the sky people hate into your village? A complete stranger?I thought he was going to take his family somewhere else and protect them on his own, but that doesn't happen. All he does is endanger more people, get the whale killed, get water people terrorized all because he decided that's where he was going to stay.I will say that there was some emotional impact with the family story this time around, but I didn't feel it was super engaging enough or as strong as some other movies.In terms of visuals - definitely stunning. If you're here to see beautiful underwater sequences in a sci fi world, this is where you want to be. None of the CG was weird or bad, so you coudl really immerse yourself in this new world over the jungle.Bringing back the same villain as a clone kind of just made me roll my eyes. We couldn't think of another antagonist that was maybe different/better? They repeated some of the things from the first one with the villain learning to be an avatar and I'm like I'VE SEEN THIS ALREADY.All the kid stuff is fine, typically I don't like seeing kids act so not really a strong point for me.The action was really good, but action cannot save a weak plot and mediocre character interactions. Felt like it dragged a bit too long, with the action and visuals the only thing keeping me awake - NOT the plot/story.Overall, if you watched and enjoyed the first avatar this is good enough, but definitely not great as a sequel."
"It's an epic fairytale sometimes brutal journey into outstanding CGI coupled with imaginary reality harmonized with nature music and pure fantasy.without spoiling anything some ideas in the storyline can easily be compared to 2022 reality . This is once again James Cameron at his best. Was a bit occasionally lost as the editing ,to my opinion did some strange cuts .Also the characters sometimes look very much alike making it difficult to figure out who is who...try let these minor details not spoil 3 hours of a pectacular motion picture making a dream come alive. It's a must to see this in 3D ."
"As a highly anticipated sequel, Cameron did depict a fantasy world which is not inferior to its predecessor. Excellent technical power was used just right. Surrounded by fluorescent creatures and exoskeleton, we seemed joined a species war far away from home actually.Even so, the movie is still inundated with a bunch of Hollywood routine. Father-son relationship, evil-greedy human beings, remorseful scientist, inspiring all-member-charging and so on.Besides, a number of the plots were nonsense. Ridiculous decisions made by characters only in order to import another plot. Won't discuss more details here."
"Avatar was always going to be a visual spectacle since the point Cameron announced the movie and there is no doubt that he had succeeded tremendously in his endeavour.Avatar the First was a benchmark film not only in terms of the visual effects but also how a big ticket movie should be in terms of innovation. Avatar 2, thanks to the development of technology and experience, takes the franchise one step ahead and sets yet another benchmark. But it is not the visuals that I am most impressed off. It is the narrative. When the film released and first reviews started coming in it was more of how I expected the film to be received. As ""Chosen One"" narratives usually tend to be, I assumed this film was going to be inferior than its predecessor. My expectations with audience reaction was that it will be considered as ""beautiful visual but weak story"" film but when I saw it I was surprised that its story is solid, perhaps even better than the First in certain aspects .The First was about Sully, the origin of the Hero. It was a classic ""chosen one"" story which is perhaps humanity's greatest story trope when it comes to storytelling albeit most used too. My apprehension with that trope is it doesn't have longevity.With the Second, Cameron very bravely gives us the other take of the ""chosen one"" narrative. Sort of the aftermath. How one can't always be the hero and how one cannot always be the one sacrificing unconditionally. That change in narrative not only brings layer to Sully and Neytiri but is also a breath of fresh air in terms of how Chosen One stories go.The Second one also brings half a dozen new characters and their dynamics into it. It brings more human ideas like family and friendship which were not there as prominent as this one in the First. This is also a positive change in my opinion. It not only increases the stakes but also invests the audience into the characters more which in turn brings much required longevity.Finally, this time Cameron goes further deep into his idea of nature's war with human. And how humans are, in their quest to ""develop"", the harbinger of destruction as he brings Pandora into life more intelligently than before.Overall, I can safely say all that hype is not misplaced with this movie and this is easily one of the best films ever made."
"I saw this film in its proper presentation in 3D with HFR, and it helps that open caption is provided so I follow the story.While I liked the first movie, especially the amazing beginning that makes very effective use of 3D in IMAX 70mm I saw on the opening night (unforgettable), that first movie's story is merely serviceable as world-building inspired by Pocahontas story. The first Avatar movie was called ""Dances with Thundercats""; pronouncing that faux title makes me laugh every time.Faux title is certainly true, but never doubt James Cameron; even if the story he tells is fairly derivative. All the stories we read and watch in movies is always derived from obscure materials, so why complain about how derivative the story is, if it can be well-told with compelling visual-aural presentation and dialogue to hold our attention?The sequel The Way of Water improves upon the first movie in almost every way. It already establishes the world of Pandora. At first when the movie opens, I wasn't ""impressed"".But when the humans ""arrive"" in ascent from the sky to depict space, it made my jaw drop in amazement, through the clever use of 3D and HFR effects. This is James' vision as announcing his return to film-making after 13 years of absence.James even employs the use of ""reverse POV"" reminiscent of GoPro in at least two scenes that are just as immersive and also emotionally invested in the characters.While it's true the dialogue is sometimes trite, what more do you want from the sequel that tries its hardest to expand the story to go further where we would least expect?This particular movie sort of suffers from the 'sequel syndrome,' that can't be helped, as repeating the story (even that James had to discard the script, which may be Avatar 1.5, after one long year of work, because it doesn't meet his strict expectation since it was more of the same story as deja vu). What lends this movie its ultimate strength is the astonishing and occasionally surrealistic visual effects, better seen with 3D (with or without HFR).One minor quibble I have with the movie, despite its amplified visual presentation as the director intended, is that HFR (high frame rate) is not effective for fast-paced action scenes -- especially in the third act -- that suffers ""fast forward syndrome"" as distracting and therefore confusing. James would be wise to try scaling down to about 30 frames per second for action scenes, or otherwise 48 HFR in some scenes look fast forwarded like on the state of the art VCR playing the videocassette.That complaint aside, the newly expansive story -- even if it repeats itself in some way through the clever yet almost contrived character ""retcon"" -- lends to ample emotional investment in the characters, which is stronger than the first movie. Towards the ending, it leads to the payoff that is rather moving (in particular the new character Kiri with astonishing preternatural power).This fresh ""retcon"" twist belies James Cameron's genius, as not only the master of visual optimization but also experiential (trying as hard as the five credited storytellers could to keep the sequel syndrome at bay) storytelling with appropriate emotional heft, without the risk of contrived manipulation.Go see Avatar: The Way of Water in the best presentation you could, even drive tens of miles farther to see it, whether in 3D regular or IMAX with or without HFR (I suggest without HFR because of fast forward effect during some quick-moving combat scenes), whether in HDR (Dolby Cinema 2D or 3D), whether in 4D, DBOX and ScreenX.These particular presentation choices amplify the moviegoing experience, what it truly means to experience cinema as the filmmakers intend that the streaming and home video technology (even state of the art projector) cannot hold the candle to, with audience participation in their varied reactions such as sound of awe, cheers and even audible cry, that makes it even better.Don't take a compromise like skipping to wait for video to rent (especially since 3D blu-ray video is petering out with the manufacturers officially phasing out 3-D capable Ultra HD TV, which is why I keep my 2015 Sony UHD TV with 3D feature to hold longer) for less.Because Avatar The Way of Water improves upon the original that lends to engrossing story with well-fleshed out characters, even if writing feels a little episodic and a little standard (hence sequel syndrome), with astounding visual effects (like the aforementioned descent from space), in the best presentation such as 3D, it feels like cinema is alive and well, in the era of tiresome ""murky"" VFX-laden superhero movie sludge called capes---.**** out of 4."
"This movie was so silly and boring at multiple times I wanted to leave the cinema.Story:
The story is completely ridiculous and is Pocahontas meets free Willy meets jungle book. It's slow and draggy in typical Cameron fashion. We get a full 30 mins of the son befriending a whale (I took this opportunity to visit the concession stand and didn't miss anything). Many in the cinema also laughed out loud at the ridiculousness of the whales talking to the main characters.For some reason there is a character which I guess is Tarzan inspired? Anyway the main characters are so dull that towards the end you actually end up rooting for the villains just to prevent another sequel.The main friction point also makes no sense, these whalers spend billions in tech to get a vial of whale juice worth $80m?Acting:
Nothing much do discuss here, not great but not bad.Graphics:
Here is where the film shines, but are they that much better than avengers or Star Wars? I would argue not, especially not for 3 hours of your time.Verdict:
It's not the worst movie ever, but it's bad. In hindsight I would not have watched it. They teased a sequel which I have no intention of seeing."
"Okay yes the the landscapes, decors, and environment content are amazing. The storyline is slow and boring. Don't even understand the hype all around for such a disappointing experience. Could have tell the story into 2h and magic! The movie would have been much better with a faster pace also. Watching this movie after 2 hours and i felt so bored. Wakanda and this movie makes me feel i want to stop going to the cinema. Such a waste of my time and such another Hollywood crap which i will forget tomorrow. 3 hours is challenging for a movie. And when your story is boring and so ordinary, 3 hours is masochism at its best. Unbearable."
"To date, there is NO movie made at this level. True theater immersive world building experience. A theme park packed into a movie. Loved the first movie 20 years ago and this had the same effect. TY JC!I will see this movie a second time. Support for the upcoming installments should be priority for fans that value the movie theater experience. This and Maverick should remind viewers what the theater is all about.Opinions are welcomed but if fans have followed JC films over the years, all his work has been a build up to these Avatar films. He still does sci-fi/military better than any other creative force. Tons of nods to Aliens and T2 high adventure story telling."
"Avatar: The Way of WaterThe digital technology that brings us back to Pandora surely is the best technical deployment of 3D on film, and the most photorealistic CGI ever created but that's it, the film has nothing else to offer.The Way of Water is less of a narrative film and more an endless tech demo one might expect to endure in purgatory.As a result, it's hard to discuss the characters or story because there aren't any, really. Most of the first and second act are unnecessary long scenes that adds nothing and there isn't any dialogue, is just CGI, music and them exploring and Cameron flexing the CGI, the third act had a few good things but not enough to make this an above average movie.The plot, is laughable. Returning villains by Stephen Lang's, his friend and they have motivations so laughably thin that is ridiculous, it doesn't even make sense. The first and second act is dragged along by a parade supporting characters splashing about on space whales, looking stern and being repetitive with the sons being sorry for what they do. That's to say nothing of the colonialist politics that the film blithely plays with. The film's politics are so laughably overused, the colonizers so comically evil, and the natives so one dimensionally noble, that it is all too childishly simplistic to even bother getting worked up over. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve but hey spending an hour watching completely unnecessary whale hunt and dragged out surprised staring is more important.Avatar 2009 wasn't exactly a masterpiece of narrative innovation but at least had a decent plot, it was emotional at some points and it wasn't a bad movie. The Way of Water doesn't have anything. Cameron has become more fascinated with the technology of storytelling, it seems he's become less so by the actual storytelling. So many years working on this film to come up with this. The ending is completely lackluster. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters and what they did with Stephen Lang character to milk more movies is just ridiculous lazy written. If I had to describe this movie would be and empty beauty, for about 2hrs you get is Cameron gloating on how beautiful his VFX are with absolutely zero story. Below average, 4/10."
"Do not listen to people's reviews that think the story is thin or light. The story is exactly what people want and expect. It is story that touches your emotions about family, love, and community. This is not a deep thinker mystery or a suspense movie, but if you've decided to see an Avatar sequel, you should already know what to expect. It is a thoroughly enjoyable action movie with happy and sad moments. It is a movie that forces the audience think more broadly about our environment, and the kind of world we want to leave for future generations... not unlike the original Avatar. The slang language and comments used by the youngster characters in the movie are funny and would be viewed as such by the younger generation in the audience. This is a ""movie"" and succeeds at entertaining the audience better than most."
"I'll keep this short, don't go see this in the theaters. The plot is even worse than the first one, and so much of this movie could have been cut out. Yeah the visuals were great as the first but that's the only thing carrying this movie. Unbelievable for how long it took for this movie to come out that the plot is this this thin and weak. It's totally predictable the same as the first one. The dialogue is very cringy as well, using awful, trendy, buzz phrases, and words. ""I got this!!"" ""Same!!"" Etc etc Cameron's talents could've been put through so much better use. I'm amazed they are making several more of these..."
"The only reason that the first film was as huge is because it was a technical masterpiece, but nowadays all big franchise films can produce the cgi at similar or even same level, so the fact that Avatar: The Way of Water just relying on visuals, and horrible writing is not gonna be enough. This film is excruciatingly boring, the run time was way too long, the plot is LITERALLY (not even exaggerating) nonexistent. Even with the stunning visualsThe first hour is pretty much a recap from previous film, then follows by an hour and a half of national geographic documentary, then some build up for next franchise. ALL (and i mean all) the characters are one dimensional, lots and lots of horrible line. I can't really tell the acting through the cgi, but the ones without cgi is borderline tolerable, almost bad even.Cameron has been working on these franchise for decades, the least he could do is to hire some proper screen writer, because MY GOD the writing is extremely awful. I'm not even surprise if the actual script is written by an intern with 0 experience. It's so cringe it gives me physical pain, and i wish i'm exaggerating.Eh, i guess if you like the first film, you might like this one. I have this sneaking suspicions that the only reasons people likes Avatar is because they have a kinks for blue people (though i don't judge), anyway....5/10
I will make an actual efforts to stop my friends from watching this boring, overhyped film."
"This is the first time in a long time (15 years maybe) that I go to the movie theater with my whole family (3 brothers, 1 sister, my mom and my dad), I wanted to do something special for Christmas and I invited them to see this movie, damn, what a good choice I make, the movie serves as a spectacular expansion of this world created by James Cameron, I doesn't have the same impact, but how do you expect to find the that kind of wonder to time in a row?In this case it doesn't reach the bar, but it gets to damn close. I will end this review with an expression from where I am from: it doesn't have any waste."
"I was surprised by the movie, at first I had my doubts about seeing it, especially because of its duration. But when I started watching it, I realized what a masterpiece was taking shape on the big screen (it seems essential to me that one experiences this movie in theaters and in 3D), how they moved into a completely different ecosystem and the different cultures and characters associated with these.If I remember correctly, the first movie was in 2012 and for being ten years old the plots were very well intertwined, you catch up very quickly with the plot.Highly recommended, waiting for the third part."
"Disclaimer - This review is based off the IMAX 3D version of the filmThe saviour of cinema? The new bastion of advanced technology? The reviver of 3D cinema? I'm not convinced the more than a decade in the making Avatar follow-up The Way of Water is any of those things but what I am certain of it being is a must-see big screen spectacle that may not be the new-age blockbuster masterpiece we all dreamed of but a film worthy of getting off your couch to go and see.Undertaking the mammoth task of creating a lighting in a bottle moment once more following on from his box-office king and technological piece of wizardry that wowed audiences across the globe in 2009, cinematic marvel James Cameron ensures here that his long in the tooth (not always in a justifiable way) H20 themed sequel goes for broke as it reacquaints us with the Sully clan who find themselves in a dangerous battle once more with humankind after a long peaceful period that flowed on from the events of the first blue cats adventure.Digging too deep into this three plus hour epics narrative would only be cause for one feeling bemusement and disappointment in various angles but if audiences are expecting a wonderous return to Pandora they get to explore, feel and live in they're in luck while those buying a ticket purely to see Cameron once more spend the big bucks exploding, crashing and offering up not to subtle environmental/climate change commentary they too will find much to enjoy in a Hollywood blockbuster that revels in what it does, warts and all.There's undoubtedly less jaw on the floor moments in Way of Water when compared to Cameron's initial outing that genuinely did feel like a big screen experience we hadn't partook in before and despite the films runtime Cameron does at times struggle to juggle a plot line that has a few too many major players that don't always feel like they get the screentime or reasons to be a part of this adventure one might've hoped for with even Zoe Saldana's feisty Neytiri shunned to the side for extended periods with much more spotlight given to some of the Sully's offspring such as Sigourney Weaver's somewhat irksome Kiri and Britain Dalton's Lo'Ak, one of the Sully's teenage boys who has inherited much of his parents determined spirit.These are but a few issues with the film that does have a few additional head scratching moments and even more poor scripting moments (cuz, I'm not lying bro) with those that found the first Avatar film grating in a dialogue or character creation sense likely to find Way of the Water even more bothersome, likely hindering any of the joys they would find elsewhere when it comes to the films money shot moments.No matter ones feelings or sentiments towards Cameron's characters, story or themes it would take a reserved mind and a total disbandment of the child-like wonderment in all of us not to be impressed by many of Way of Water's stunningly created set-pieces, world building moments or colourful creatures (the mysterious Payakan is likely to become a fan favourite) and while it's hard to fathom this early on just what Cameron's return to the big screen or blue world means for cinema or the brand as a whole, we can be thankful the bearded master is back providing us with such lavish entertainment once more, even if it may not entirely be up to the standards we've come to expect over a long and prosperous career.Final Say -A must-see big screen experience, Avatar: The Way of Water may not be an all-round success story but its stunning realisation of what makes cinema special and how it can remind its audience of it, provides us with more than evidence enough that Cameron still has what it takes to give us cinematic experiences no one else can.3 1/2 loincloths out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"

"Avatar: The Way of Water has got to be the best 3D spectacle I have ever been a part of. And that is how you feel while you are in the midst of this theatre experience. Like you are part of it.Is it a little long? Sure.Is the story a little thin? SureIs it the coolest thing you will see in 3D for the near future? Definitely.It has everything a Hollywood movie should have. Action, adventure, love, emotion, a despicable bad guy, a bad-ass mother, a loving father, greedy corporate monsters, real monsters, lovable animals, kids you want to hug, kids you want to smack, robots, space ships, cool airplanes and boats -- and all in the best 3D imaginable. It feels like you walked into Pandora itself -- made me want to call the realtor and move. I mean... If you can't find something to love in this, you just need to stop going to the movies."
"I really looked forward to watching it and really wanted to like it, but unfortunately that didn't happen. The visual effect are great, and everybody agrees on that! But the movie it self was in no way as good as the first one. I watched Avatar 1, 5 or 6 times and have no desire to watch this one a 2nd time. No story, no magic, and 3:18 hours was way to long and made it boring. The whole thing was done with animated characters without any live human interaction like in Avatar 1, which made it hard to impossible to identify yourself with any of the characters. If the following movies which are already made are similar i would not even go to a movie theater to watch any of them and may or may not watch it when it comes on TV but another 3 Hour Avatar movie is nothing i would look forward to. It would be great if Mr. Cameron reads and understand his Ex Fans and adjusts accordingly. Because if he doesn't it would be a shame that such a good start with Avatar 1 will simple be a big looser. Well, go watch it anyway but don't expect anything like the 1st. Avatar Movie."
"Ive watched twice in 3D. Thoughts1. Yes you need to see this in 3D in the best theatre possible.2. The underwater photography is like nothing you have seen before. Cameron has done it again.3. It did not blow my mind like the first film did. I really enjoyed myself, but can't say I loved it like I love every other James Cameron film.4. Partly this is because narratively the story structure is very similar to the first.5. Unlike T2 and Aliens, Cameron doesn't try a different path for the sequel. He just extends it.6. It's like a greatest hits of T2, Abyss, Titanic, Aliens and Avatar. Since I love those films, this isn't a complaint!7. Sigourney Weaver character and performance was truly enchanting. Sam Worthington was great too.8. I was never bored or cognisant of the 3 hours.9. Of coarse, the last hour is textbook action, emotion and suspense.10. The kids were all great, but the family angle still wasn't enough to earn #Avatar2 a place on the all time classics podium besides Aliens and T2. Hoping James Cameron pushes the narrative as far for Avatar 3, as he pushed the cinematic experience."
"The most beautifully awful film ever
cnmzpvzg19 December 2022This review is basically whats wrong with society: i dont understand how anyone, anyone in the right mind would give this a 1star... but then there are idiotsThe plot was non-existent, stereotyped and predicable. The cultural appropriation was inexplicable - maori aliens? Really? The acting... average at best. The ending... dear god... when? When will it end? Please God let the movie end. Why has it not ended yet?The movie would have benefited enormously from being a full 2 hours shorter, cutting out the entire middle section and the final 20 minutes could have eliminated.This was comfortably the worst review ive read.Watch way of the water, its possibly one of the best films of our generation. Its leaps and bounds ahead of any other movie out in the last 100 years and it makes all marvel movies look weak. It drags you through emotions, shows how horrible humans are but yet how gentle we can be. The visuals and cgi is next level and almost seems more real than reality itself. Dont listen to all the hate with people having 1% intellagence. Spend the money to see this and support something that will be looked at for years and years. James Cameron is way beyond our liftetime and when hes gone maybe then others can catch up."
"The Way of Water starts a bit slow and into known territory. But once the water appears turns into a jaw dropping experience of the highest level with outstanding production design, incredible diving sequences and likeable characters.The 3D feels very organic and less intrusive than in the first one, and the final 50 minutes contain some of the best action sequences ever filmed. They feel very real, with a smaller scale than the first one but much more impressive, and the visual effects are so good that they make Marvel films look like cartoon films.The ending left me with tears in my eyes and wanting for more, with the sensation that I had an experience larger than life. And that's exactly what cinema is about!!!Thank you, James Cameron. I can't wait for Avatar 3!"
"God I can't tell you how utterly dissapointed I am. I LOVED the first film but this fell flat in its face. There was NO story and the bit of story that hung around was a badly written version of the first story?? I mean robot crabs and lame plot holes that made no sense, half told character stories left unfinished, it's not like they didn't have enough time to tell the story either. It clung far too annoyingly close to the original story line, using the same nicknames, same revenge plot, same characters and the same character process as last time. You can't deny the visuals, they are stunning but that's all it is and unfortunately with such a limp story it just wasn't enough to carry it through. The way of water is almost an exact copy of the first film but in the water and not the woods. Meh."
"Don't waste your time or money watching this at the cinema, plenty have already made that mistake.This film is a CGI-fest in search of a story and squanders the best new characters for the sake of rehashing the old with no added value. In fact I was left wondering what story if any they were trying to tell with so many excellent plot lines left on the cutting room floor.For the last hour or more I was waiting for the credits with a tedious drawn out sequence trying so desperately to be epic but only succeeding in confirming this films mediocre quality.A word of advice for Avatar 3 - get the story right and the rest will follow."
"This movie is another technological achievement, but that's about all it is. The writing and acting were subpar, to say the leas. I suppose if I were in my teens, I'd think this movie was a great achievement (if I could sit through a 3+ hour movie at that age), but I'm older than that and prefer movies with some meat to them. I enjoyed the first movie. It had an actual storyline, even it it was a bit weak and predictable. But this? Really, it's just a beautiful visual assault and that's all.Although I've not been a tremendous fan of Cameron's movies, this has to be a career low for him. He should have hired someone who can write a decent story and create decent dialogue. I don't recommend spending money on going to a theater to watch this one. Wait until is streams."
"Despite being able to recognize the flaws in the first Avatar, I couldn't help but fall in love with it. The Na'vi, their culture and their beautiful world were incredibly well executed with a lot of love and dedication behind it. It was such an immersive experience.And Way of the Water was no different in that regard. What an experience.Not perfect but the good, for me, far outshines the not so good.The story meant more to me this time. There are themes of loss and I did get choked up a few times. It was more emotional than I anticipated. I expected similar to the first movie but some aspects of the story felt more powerful.The execution of certain scenes was just phenomenal. From the cinematography, to the acting...the editing was great too. I felt like the 3 hours flew by, it was so immersive (both worldbuilding and story wise), enchanting and entertaining.The cheesy dialogue usually comes from scenes with humans but since the focus is the Na'vi it didn't really bother me. Same as the first movie...humans had the cheesy bits of dialogue while the Na'vi dialogue was beautifully done.I had an amazing time watching this movie and I recommend anyone to give it a try.Also, it's the very best movie to watch 3D IMAX. It's pretty much the only movie where I think 3D works the best.The 3D here was mindblowing. So many scenes where I just had this silly smile on my face...what an experience!But visuals and 3D aside, I did enjoy the story more. It gripped me from beginning to end.Are there things that could be improved? Sure. But despite a few flaws, it's still an impactful story.So yeah, I loved it. Stop reading reviews and go watch it yourself! 😁"
"If you loved or really enjoyed the first Avatar film 13 years ago, you will very much like or love this sequel. Heads up, definitely best to go in watching this by having seen the first one, otherwise you will be confused about the storyline and scope of what is going on character-wise.James Cameron is a pro at churning out a superior sequel to a foundational first film. So, it should come as no surprise that Avatar: The Way of Water improves or maintains the same level on everything the first film had with a powerful escapism atmosphere again: character development, straightforward but interesting plot, gripping action and fight sequences, visual effects, cinematography, motion capture, performance capture, music score, production design, editing, sound design, sound mixing. The skin texture, background visuals, and ALL the visuals in all the scenes are beyond INCREDIBLE, top-level quality! And the water, oh man the photo-realistic VFX UNDERWATER scenes are impressive, beautiful, and have a calmingly ethereal quality, a feast for the eyes. This entire film is a gorgeous, mesmerizing visual feast. And the runtime is a breezy 3 hours 12 minutes, it honestly felt like the same runtime as the first Avatar film. The runtime doesn't feel sluggish at all, that's how you know it's an interesting, entertaining, and fascinating viewing experience. I honestly would not have minded if this film was an additional half hour or more.The film's themes of family, identity, loss, acceptance, spirituality in connection with the death and rebirth cycle, discrimination, and prejudice (against Na'vi/ avatar hybrid or mixed breed Na'vi, who are mixed with human DNA as distinguished by having five fingers instead of four that native, full blood Na'vi possess) and environmentalism are deeply prevalent, including diaspora which is one of the central conflicts in the plot. The emotional and heart-to-heart scenes are moving and do not feel forced, but effortlessly convey the nuances and feelings of the characters. I got teary-eyed at one point when a tragic event hits the family and did not see that coming. It's a really sad, heartbreaking scene.There were a few callbacks to the original film at the beginning almost shot-by-shot, which was a pleasant homage to the OG Avatar that started it all.The two lead characters, Jake Sully and Neytiri (played respectively by Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldaña who continue having natural, terrific on-screen chemistry), are still the core characters in this film, with a primary focus on their kids. The film does a commendable job at fleshing out their 5 kids (3 are biological - Neteyam, Lo'ak, Tuktirey), 2 are adopted - Kiri (the biological, hybrid daughter of Dr. Grace Augustine's avatar body from the first film) and Spider (an orphaned human adopted by Jake and his family, whose father is revealed to be the deceased ""human version"" Colonel Quaritch and who has a strained relationship with his adoptive mother Neytiri because of this paternity fact) and making each one distinguishable enough in their character development and personalities, where we actually fully remember and can identify each one by name way before the film credits roll. Often, especially in a sequel when new supporting characters are introduced, they become forgettable and/or indistinguishable, we don't remember their names, or their unique character traits. Yet, The Way of Water easily avoids this characterization failure.For the upcoming sequels, I'm curious to see what other threats and villains the Sully family will have to face aside from Jake's arch-enemy, Colonel Quaritch. The hint at humans using an anti-aging serum (that stops human aging), a bright golden yellow oil substance extracted from the body of a killed Tulkun is interesting and I hope this is developed more in the sequels, and how or if this could make the humans more powerful when facing the Na'vi. This is also a more serious threat to the Pandora environment and Na'vi, since this anti-aging serum is highly valuable to humans back on Earth and this would lead to them increasingly exploiting the natural resources of Pandora to make a profit and save the human race.This sequel and its predecessor are films meant to be seen and thoroughly enjoyed on the big screen. It's not casual viewing but an immersive, engrossing, eye-popping visual fest viewing experience. The visual effects are the best you'll experience from any action adventure sci-fi film right now or from any film heavy in VFX. James Cameron is a game changer and visual effects sci-fi pioneer. He is constantly pushing the boundaries of how far you can depict the closest possible photo-realistic, real-life vision visuals on the big screen and this sequel has further enhanced VFX. I also think most if not all the scenes are filmed in 4K or 8K HDR or a higher frame rate for the film resolution, which very much amplifies all the hard work dedicated to the motion capture and performance capture visual effects technology.Minor criticism on a few abrupt scene cuts interspersed with a displaced transition or no transition to the next scene. A character says a piece of dialogue and another character replies back or doesn't. Then the scene cuts abruptly, not allowing the dialogue, character emotion, and facial reactions to settle. Yeah, I get it, the film editors and James Cameron was trying to cut down as much time as to stick to the run time of 3 hours 12 minutes. However, the transitions could've been much slicker but this is a minor discrepancy in the grand scale of all the positives the film does have.Avatar: The Way of Water is a superior sci-fi, fantasy, action, adventure sequel that hits the bullseye and is on the same level of storytelling and plot action as the first film, but to a greater extent in fleshing out character connections and development and enriching the world building of Pandora. Recommended watching in IMAX 3D or just any big screen format period.Looking forward to the next sequel in 2024!!"
"I really did not connect with any character in this movie. My memory of the characters was from the very first movie which delivered fantastic performances by everyone. Avatar 2 failed to meet the expectations of what makes a good sequel, which it sadly is not.This movie is a rehash of the first. The dead bad guy, whom we were so happy to see dead, is back again, this time in an Avatar body. So back to square one, as it obliterated the fantastic climactic ending of the first one by resurrecting the bad guy. This is lazy and unimaginative story telling.The attack on Sully by the predator Thanator has parallels with the way the giant shark-like creature attacks his son in the new movie.In the first movie, the humans take down 'home tree', with which the Navi were deeply connected. Well, in the second outing of Avatar, the humans take down a whale to extract precious liquid from its brain. Does 'unobtanium' ring a bell from Avatar?In the first movie, Neytiri kills the bad guy. He gets resurrected. In this movie, Sully kills the bad guy, and to save you the two year wait, he gets resurrected again. So now this is a viscous cycle of the same good vs bad guy in different settings and in different environments.If you want to watch it, appreciate the graphics in the movie, but apart from that, I really did not connect with any character. Let's see what Avatar 3 does in 2024."
"This is more than just a movie it's a ride and a Journey into another universe. I forgot 3-D was a thing for the last 11 years and that's because James Cameron hadn't made a movie since avatar. It's like being on a star tours ride for three hours and 10 minutes. Now we can sit here and nitpick some of the exposition and development of some of the newer characters but as the ride went we figured all that out and it really didn't take away from the fun and escapism factor. This is a popcorn movie with a heart and all of the agendas are embedded so deeply that it's not offensive. We are all are rooting for Pandora and the Navi people and if that is politically correct, so be it. This was a great continuation of the original story and the motion capture underwater scenes were absolutely breathtaking (pun intended.). When I heard that Kate Winslet held her breath for over six minutes I was even more excited to see this film. This is nowhere near James Cameron's finest work but he should win all the Oscars for a lifetime of great storytelling... he is due!"
"I went too see it in cinema as I was interested. The movie was not boring, it was mostly good to look at and it didn't feel too long. So I don't think my money was wasted.However, on my opinion, the movie was a huge waste of the zillions of money they (well, mostly Mr Cameron) used for making it. I can't believe they used so many years making a film with a plot which is so half-witted and has holes almost as big as the moon Pandora. Why did the Sullys go hiding among the water tribe, and only there without ever thinking anything else, even though they knew nobody there and knew nothing about their culture? How's it possible that there was a thriving ""whaling"" industry with specialized vessels and ships and a huge amount of trained crew, only after a couple of years after the humans re-entered Pandora (and just found out about the ""whale brain liquid"")? And I certainly didn't like how it was just like Titanic in the end.Even worse was the character building was really poor or actually just nonexistent. I can't believe, that in every turn, every single character, does exactly what you would suppose them to do, and occasionally, something even more stupid. The bad guys are just like ""yeah, we're so bad"" and that's it. And others are just like ""always protect the family"" and that's basically it. In the end, there was exactly one character that was somehow interesting, thankfully.Because of the character issue, I really didn't care much what happened to everyone in the story. As a result the movie was not very thrilling or intriguing.As it's said everywhere, the visuals are the best part of the film. That is true. However, maybe because of the theatre I was, I wasn't really blown away. It was my first 3D in years and I had forgotten how the glasses feel. But it looked good. And to say something positive, the years used for developing underwater filming, were not wasted. The underwater scenes were simply gorgeous, the best I've ever seen on screen.To sum up: using this amount of time and money for working with the filming technology should have deserved a better story and interesting characters. This way, it could have been an epic experience. But this opportunity was missed. Now it was just a pretty show, mildly interesting, but as a whole a bit lame."
"I want to start by saying that this movie is both visually and musically stunning. But that's all there is to it, and every astounding visual feels lackluster in front of a plot which is not simply basic: it's straight bad.I won't tire you with a full plot. If you're reading this spoiler, you've either already seen the movie or you don't care much about it, so let's get straight to the flaws. There are many of them, so fasten your seatbelt.At the beginning of the movie, we're thrown into it. It's not a ""medias res"" thing: things are simply not explained. In a bad way. The protagonist somehow had children, but we don't care how. Not that that matters, since their characterization is flatter than the Earth according to some folks.We've got Jake, the protagonist, who's now a troubled dad who doesn't understand his children. We've got the mother, who doesn't understand her children and blames the father. Great. Then we've got the two kids: the older is your typical soldier; he follows the rules, get sometimes carried by the young one, and takes every responsability. That's all to him. Seriously.Then there's the younger one, who gets some more focus. For nothing, since he's the typical youngster who's reckless and all. Does he grow out of it? Not really.Lastly, we've got the biblical character: a girl who was born by the scientist and... We don't know. Maybe the Holy Spirit. She can communicate with the god of Pandora, but we don't know much about it yet. At the moment, she just feels like a Deus Ex Machina to save the guys a bunch of times.Oh, and there's a third kid, but she exists only to get lost or kidnapped, so I forgot her 12 hours after seeing the movie.What about the other characters?We've got the bad guy from the first movie, who gets resurrected because god forbids being creative when your story is set in another damned world. They pulled a SW9 with that one. But don't worry: despite being hinted to be a different guy, that part of the plot gets trashed and he's still a genocidal guy with a bit softer flavor.Then we got Spider, his son, who hates him. But when he gets kidnapped, he's immediately ""Oh hi daddy!"" and forgets about his genocides until the end of the movie. Yes, the character is plain and useless like the rest of the cast.Last but not least, we've got the best character in all the movie, no jokes: a damn whale. Yes, you heard me well: a whale whos background gets like five minutes of spotlight is better than every other guy. Also, he's a badass.Yeah, I spent a lot of time talking about the most boring characters you'll ever see, since the plot is non-existent. Let me tell you why.The family flees from their tribe, never to be seen again.They meet the water tribe, and they're racists. Apart from the daughter of the chief, who's the youngster's love interest. That's all to them.Miles, the bad guy from the first movie, decides that wasting the lives of a hundred of his men and billions of dollars is a fair price to gets his revenge. And nobody stops him. They shrug it off as ""he may lead another uproar!"", but they don't care when he flees and becomes basically a non-existent threat. Back to the ""plot"".The bad guys come. They get mowed down, but since they've got zero characterization we don't really care about those human pawns.Meanwhile, the youngster befriends a whale after the other kids tried to kill him because... They had a brawl? Have you ever pushed a kid down a cliff after he punched you? No? Well, boys will be boys; we like to kill other kids at the first chance.The humans attack. Spider is useless as usual. Big fight ensues, where the whale is the MVP. That's also because, when the fight is basically won, the water tribe disappears. Yes, you heard me well: they fight in the battle, but a second later - when it's show-off time - they vanish into thin air, to let the protagonist and antagonist do their thing. Oh, meanwhile, the sole reason of existence of half of the family is to get kidnapped.As already mentioned, it's show-off time: bad guy vs good guy. The family sees some gasoline fire on the water and, despite the lack of waves - being nearby a ton of planets produces no tides, I guess - they decide to take cover inside the death trap that's the exploding ship. Yes, they learned how to swim underwater for a mile, but we don't care: nothing has ever made sense in this movie. They use guns underwater. We're in a damn sci-fi and they can't get the sci part right, despite being a multi-billion franchise with nice mechas.Back to the final fight. Jake and his wife easily kill every marine, who seem to have forgotten how to fight 20v2 with mech suits and all. So we're left with the bad guy holding the son-of-the-Force girl hostage. Oh, the brave older kid died, but we don't really care at this point since he had no personality nor background nor anything, and people like him are getting mowed each second.Bad guy sees his kid and frees the hippy girl because his character has developed. Or so they're trying to sell us, but it feels forced and irrelevant.1v1 fight. Good guy wins. Spider saves his dad but flees from him. Everybody is good. Credits roll.I'd wish to say that there's something more to it, but there isn't. The plot feels like one of that basic Hollywood movies whose sole reason to exist is to have guys kill each others. And that would be fine, if the Avatar worldbuilding wasn't as complex as it is.All around, the movie feels like a lackluster cash grab from guys who really don't care about the movie. Nice visuals and score tho."
"This movie was more beautiful, powerful, emotional, and it was totally 13 years worth await to return to Pandora! Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldaña, have done a great job with there beautiful performance, especially Sigourney Weaver and Stephan Lang with one of my favorite characters from the first movie.The story was beautiful and touching and so incredible, the music was so beautiful, and also new characters were so amazing, the designs and the most amazing visual effects were very beautiful, new creatures and especially new big machines who were totally badass. ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" was everything that I could ever imagine on the big screen and going back to Pandora!I totally recommend watching Avatar: The Way of Water, because it looks like James Cameron has done it again, and it was bigger and better than the first movie. I sincerely hope the new Avatar, breaks a whole new world box office records around the world!(Oel Ngati Kameie) - I see you."
"When will directors realize that a Higher Frame Rate does not enhance film quality but instead is distracting and pulls the viewer out of the film experience. It makes things look fake, and when a film is already heavy laden with CGI that is a recipe for a dizzying and nauseating experience. In this film, unlike The Hobbit which used HFR for the entire film, James Cameron uses HFR (48fps) for action scenes and the Standard Frame Rate of 24fps for close-ups and dialogue. It does not work. Cameron is a master of the craft and has always been pushing the boundaries of film and advancing the viewer experience, but this experiment must come to an expedient and final end."
"An exciting return to Pandora: the world of Na'vi. One of the best movies, like 2009's Avatar, to see in 3D! The characters seem to come out of the screen and it seems to witness the events firsthand. The world of Na'vi has changed and is once again in danger. Man is the cause of evil as in reality. We are destroying our planet that used to be our Pandora. Pandora is our home, we are Pandora. The houses of the Na'vi look like the tents of the American Indians, for me this is no coincidence and recalls the genocide of the American Indians. In my opinion it is a good sequel that deals with very relevant themes such as love, family and mourning. The initial water monologue which then returns towards the end is very poetic and universal! Emotional film that in some parts makes you cry. I recommend viewing in 3D for those who have already seen the previous film and were fascinated by that amazing world and the protagonist's love and life story."
"As expected, this movie is visually spectacular with cutting edge animation. I did have warning that the story was a bit on the slow side, and I adjusted my expectations to accommodate; but not quite enough. The first issue I had with the story was the fact that the villains focused on taking out our hero Jake and his family. By all means, let's ignore the Navi attacks and send the clones that cost a bajillion space credits to make after Jake, who ""ran away to hide""; and the fact that he ran away to begin with was the second issue I have with this script. Neither of these two plot twists are believable.I guess the lack of believability can be forgiven, as this movie is clearly a setup for a final confrontation in the third movie."
"Same movie as before but with higher resolution, not worth it to me! Boring 3 hours and 10 minutes. James Cameron should stick to real life events and movies like Titanic which he could remake and with better actors and this time try and make it as close to what happened and not just a bunch of love story , give all on board a chance to tell their story through cinema. Needs more truth in pictures today. The reason hollywierd is failing is because they continue to make garbage that nobody wants to watch and enough with the fantasy films and fake creatures, we have enough freaks trying to run our school system today!"
"See AVATAR: THE WAY OF WATER on the biggest 3D Screen, with the best Sound System possible. It is a technical marvel...way ahead of anything that has, thus far, been seen on a movie screen.It's too bad the story (and characters) lag far behind.Taking the audience back to the world of Pandora, AVATAR: THE WAY OF WATER treads familiar territory as Director James Cameron returns us to this idyllic planet, with the natives living peacefully, in concert with the land, until the soldiers from Earth show up (again) to strip the planet of it's native contents (again).Cameron (TITANTIC) expands this 3D World, bringing the audience from the trees to the water - and what an expansion this is! It is a BEAUTIFUL film to watch and Cameron (as one would expect) expertly pushes the technological edges of the industry, bringing us stunning visuals underwater. It is this part of the more than 3 hour film that is worth the price of admission alone. It is a feast for the eyes.But what Cameron (and his FOUR writers of the script - never a good sign) fail to do is to add interesting characters and stories to these amazing visuals. It is a pretty straight forward telling of Good (the native peoples) vs. Evil (the invading soldiers from Earth). There is no nuance or subtly whatsoever throughout this film.Back from the first film are Sam Worthington (just as wooden and uninteresting), Zoe Saldana (just as underused) and Stephen Lang (just as one-note as the villain). Obviously, it is just their voices used - for they are all rendered as Pandorans via motion-capture - but they don't have much to do except be one with the nature (the good guys) or destroy nature (the soldiers).Joining the cast - and just as underused - are Cliff Curtis, CCH Pounder and, especially, Kate Winslet. Cameron brings in some really fine performers who have to spout wooden dialogue that would make George Lucas blush - all the while performing in motion capture suits. This movie could have been so much better had Cameron given these actors something better and more interesting to do.The only exception to this is the young actress (so I thought) that portrayed Kiri - who is the daughter of the Sigourney Weaver character from the first film. This Pandoran was born under mysterious circumstances (Virgin birth? Do we have a Messiah?) and is more in tune with the nature of the world they live in. This young actress had the most interesting things to do and she absolutely nailed it, so I should not have been surprised to find out that this ""young actress"" was none other than - Sigourney Weaver.Well done, Cameron and Weaver. You got me on this one.This film (the second in what will be a trilogy - or maybe more) has a run time of over 3 hours - so be warned - but Cameron keeps things moving along at a sprightly pace, never lingering over the clunky dialogue, but stopping to watch the beautiful visuals along the way.AVATAR: THE WAY OF WATER is worth watching for the water and the stunning visuals...but not for much else.Letter Grade: B+ (10 for the visuals, 5 for the story)
7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
"Titanic was a love story on a sinking ship. Aliens was a troup of people rescuing colonists. Terminator 2 was a robot sent back in time to protect a future rebel leader. As with all great movies from James Cameron, the story is secondary to the experience. And wow, what an experience Avatar 2 is. It is visually stunning. The na'vi and the world are so realistic, you actually believe they are real. Cameron has created an entire planet of species and nature and it is all made up, but it looks to real that you might believe it actually exists. The movie is over 3 hours, but you will not be bored.The story is quite simple: men want payback for Avatar 1 and hunt Sully down. He flees with his family to a different place, but you know that the movie will end with a battle. Men are evil, Na'vi are good. But still, as the movie progresses you notice yourself actually rooting for Jake and even more for his kids.The movie actually does make me invest in the characters. I've seen people crying in the theater. Avatar 1 didn't do that, but this ones does. So to all the haters: you are wrong. This movie does not only stand on visuals, but also carries emotions. Despite of a simple story, but so was Titanic. Point is: James Cameron did it again. This is a must see movie!"
"I am a big fan of the first Avatar movie so I went into this movie with very high expectations. As before the visuals were amazing and transported me to another world. I also really liked the angle of Jake having a family the kids were really enjoyable to watch. But when all was said and done it seemed like there weee a lot of details they did not explain very well or briskly addressed and left me wanting more. I would be curious to know what the directors cut looked like because this edition seemed a little quick. One thing I did not like was the new material they discovered in the whale creatures that ""completely stops the aging process of humans"". It felt very out of place and like an excuse for a reason to make the water tribes angry at the humans. I also felt like Jake abandoning the tree people in the beginning was very out of character for him. Even if he wanted to protect his family it does not seem like he would just get up and leave. It felt like a weak excuse to introduce another tribe. Lastly, it seemed like Sigourney Weavers character did not develop her story enough of how she randomly has these powers. Kind of ethereal and not in a good way. However, as you can see I rated this movie an 8/10 because I still really enjoyed the movie. It pulled me away from earth for three hours and made me wish I could explore Pandora."
"Watching this in 3D reminded me just how incredible 3d can be when done well, it truly is the best visual spectacle on film. For me the main plot was not that interesting. The vendetta between cloned Quarich and Jake Sully seemed to be a small part of a very complex world, I was expecting a story with more depth and intelligence. Revenge plots can be great, kill bill, sin city etc, but the world of pandora deserves more. While the original Avatar did not have the best story, the outcast becomes leader story of A1, is more interesting then a rather simple revenge plot. I'm glad they give a reason why the humans returned, earth is dying and they need to get rid of the Navi resistance lead by Jake Sully. The thing is, it could of been more interesting, limiting the movie to the Quarich clone hunting Jake was too simplistic, it could of been part of the main plot but it needed other characters and methods pushing earth's agenda. The movie does introduce a lot of knew characters, species and characteristics of pandora, but they don't push the main plot and don't really enhance this movie.So pleased the humans motives were addressed but it's to bad the main story could of been something better. I still recommend a watch, the visuals are incredible and a lot of things do get an acceptable answer."
"Story as before is very weak. Felt more like a build up to the next movie. Very boring and dragged for no reason to just look at the shiny visuals. And it seems to have worked alot of people seem to say 10/10 great visuals...a movies not about visuals especially in this day and age.I can't really rate the acting as its covered by cgi the emotion and intensity wasn't bad but again a very generic tale just like the first.It lacks any originality apart from lovely music and shiny cgi. Apart from that it leaves little to be desired, like the original also maybe watch once for the shiny visuals but don't expect anything deep or new."
"When the first Avatar came out in 2009 it was a phenomenon. It was the film to see. Everyone was talking about it and it was a resounding financial success and still remains the highest grossing film of all time. I know the original film has it's lovers and detractors. I fall in between. I liked the film but I didn't absolutely love it. I don't re is it it asuch as I do other blockbusters. Even other film by James Cameron like The Terminator or Aliens. But it was visually stunning. The 3D was fantastic. Even in 2p09 I hated 3D but this film was filmed in 3D so i saw it in that format and it was great. The complaints about that film was that it was too familiar a story. It was very familiar. The problem with that is tht it's main character wasn't all that memorable. The visuals made up for the lack of a great main character. Sam Worthington was fine as Sully but it could have been any other actor. Sully is not a really memorable hero The best character from the first film is Neytiri played by Zoe Saldaña.Well 13 years have passed and we finally get Avatar: The Way Of Water. James Cameron promised this film many times but it took a really long time to get it to theaters. This new story revolves around Sully, Neytiri and their lives years after the events of the first film. They have 5 kids and live a peaceful life in Pandora. But of course the the evil humans, Sky People as the Na'vi say are back to colonize their planet. The RDA has advanced the avatar technology to insert human memories of their human counterparts. The company brings back Colonel Miles Quaritch in avatar form to find and kill Sully. A film of this kind is only as good as it's villain and Stephen Lang is as good as the villain here again. The story is similar to the first film and deals with much of the same themes but the film focuses more in Sully's kids. Esoecially the middle son who has problems with being overshadowed by his brother. The film looks truly stunning. The images are more detailed and complex than the first film but the look is very much the se but the improvement in the CGI is totally apparent. All of the visually spendor would not be as good if we as an audience didn't care about the characters. Again, there is nothing new storywise here but their is enough character development to care about Sully's family. One thing I do think is that Neytiri tales a backseat here. She was the best character in the first film. Sully is a weak main character. San Worthington is not given much to do except be the protective fatherThe action is great as always, the last 45 minutes of the film is just non stop action but James Cameron is such a great action director that it is really exciting.Even though this film and it's predecessor are visual marvels I feel the characters needed to be stronger and more memorable.That keeps this film from being truly special but it is a great spectacle to behold.Grade: B."
"The plot is basically all of the hollywood tropes bundled together while the visual effect is the essence of hollywood AE bundled together.Avatar 1's story, while simple and cliche, still serves it's purpose well, and don't hinder the movie experience. Avatar 2's story, more complicated but a lot of it is just illogical and kick you out of the immersion sometimes. I won't go into the specifics but let's just say there are too many plot lines that are either wasted or could be cut and won't affect the story telling.Also, the whole bullying arc is just wow. Like this is year 2023 and we are doing this classical 80s school bully routine? Lure the kid out by saying he is a chicken and then abandoning him to... get eaten by giant ass fishes? Like man this is attempted murder, not some kid's play."
"The long awaited sequel has finally arrived. Avatar: The Way of the Water is a great movie, and far from a disappointment. It has stunning visuals, some of the best I've seen this year. Engaging action scenes, which feel real and impactful. An interesting plot that keeps me interested.The only downside is that the story drags on, and we get long and unnecessary 20-30 minute scenes of just watching them swim, watching the animals. It feels like watching a nature documentary at times. You could cut out all of those scenes and not lose anything.Another thing that could have been better was the plot. It was interesting, it was good, but it had quite a few holes and a lot of things that didn't really make much sense. The story was also really predictable and unnecessarily dragged out.Overall it's a good movie, would recommend, but it could be a lot shorter."
"Honestly, I loved the first movie. I was blown away by the CGI in it and the storyline was good as although it was a common one, it didn't matter, it all fitted in and the entire experience of the movie was like nothing I had been to before. But that was 12 years ago. Now, it's as if we are expected to watch 3hrs of the same special effects (which these days and how much CGI and technology and AI has advanced in the past decade, compared to watching a fancy shimmering screensaver) with not only the same storyline and characters, but the storyline is barely there it's so bad. It's as if they threw the storyline together at the last minute with the mindset that nobody would notice as we would all be too busy looking at the shiny glittery CGI. Perhaps - don't make it 3hrs next time!!"
"Great effects in 3D but it really is boring and way too long. Shame it's cost so much money, I may well be missing something but uts not this film!Not sure how else to sum this up James Cameron has done some great films but his Avatar project is just daft.Do you really have to write 600 words now to get a review published to stop people spending hard earned cash on this tripe? I guess so, so what else to say? I don't really like this film although I love sci fi films. Hmmm still not enough words, terminator was a great film and still works today. You can't hold down a good story maybe James should have considered this?"
"December 14th, 2022. 13 years of eagerly awaiting the return to pandora are over.I experienced the movie last night and what has Jim done. What has he done. The Way of Water is a cinematic miracle. What he created is something unthinkable, incomprehensible and unimaginable. He delivers a modern day odyssey that left my jaw on the floor for hours. It's Best movie of the year and it's not close. I've never seen something so marvellous put on canvas, never. Nothing comes even close. It's pure enchantment and wonder. It's a movie full of profound significance and narrative intelligence.All actors were terrific. Lo'ak, Kiri and Tsireya are instant new fan favorites. And Quaritch is brilliant. Huge improvement in versatility over the first movie. Cameron knows exactly how to write compelling characters that resonate with the viewer on a profound level. Jake and Neytiri at this point, are so unbelievably honest and real, they really feel like people I've known my whole life.I cared so so much about the whole Sully family, so the movie fulfilled its task in the very best way possible. My personal highlight in the movie is Lo'ak's relationship with the Tulkun Payakan. Their interactions gave me teary eyes time and time again.Overall there is this astonishing beauty and energy overarching the whole movie, even more so than there's already been in the original movie. You can feel with every sense how Cameron poured his heart and soul into every little detail of his whole-cloth reality, with meticulous world-building that is more enveloping than anything I've ever experienced. The marine wildlife and eco systems feel as multilayered and personality-filled as fully fleshed out characters. The camera work is Oscar worthy. Mind blowingly goo. Especially the POV action shots in combination with the HFR made my heart rate go to risky heights and hands sweaty as hell. Cameron never cuts away the action and brute force of a scene. That makes the whole 193 minutes utterly satisfying to watch.And yeah TWOW again proves that Cameron is the MASTER of sequels. The first act may be the best continuation of a story I've ever seen. You're instantly hooked and absorbed by everything that's going on. Jim has come up with a big, exciting and powerful story that touches universal themes, homages his previews works and will be exhilarating to see spanning, developing and unraveling over the next three sequels.TWOW is a never before seen audiovisual miracle - until that crown is passed, inevitably, in December 2024, to Avatar 3.-Update after a few more viewings-
I can't believe how perfect this movie is. I can't stop watching it. The magic doesn't diminish in the slightest. It is almost a meditative experience.And Zoe Saldana owns the the screen every time she's on it. Pure beauty in her appearance and radiation. So genuine and caring. Payakan makes my heart melt. Lo'ak is the perfect character to lay the focus on for the sequels. Stephen Lang also is beautiful. Yeah they're I said it. I loved him. His interactions with Spider. You can feel it. Their Darth Vader-Luke-esque relationship works perfectly for this saga. Sam Worthington also puts in the gravitas effortlessly. I could listen to him all day long. And Sigourney Weaver simply the greatest. The Sully family FEELS so much like a real family. This is maybe the movies biggest accomplishment.Each time I watch it, I am touched by different scenes, and the depth of the direction and meaning of each scene becomes more and more apparent. There is not a single shot that is left to chance. Set ups, foreshadowing, callbacks, everything is connected. Just like the way of water.I bow down to Mr. Cameron, truly Hollywoods biggest dreammaker."
"Go see this film at the cinema, it is nothing like I have ever seen. I didn't rush to see it when it opened but that didn't mean I wasn't keen to watch it. Stunning visual effects like nothing I have ever seen, some scenes look more impressive than real life. You can see where the money went here, the action scenes are well placed and paced, amazing. I'd say probably 15 mins or so could be cut, some minor filler here and there but overall, I found this to be better than the original. Really looking forward to the next chapter and I see what Cameron is doing here, building a world within the world of Pandora to expand on with each film."
"Avatar: The Way of Water is an excellently crafted film. In the first Avatar, Cameron delivered outstanding visuals as he excelled in building the unique and exhilarating atmosphere of Pandora. Unsurprisingly, this sequel enjoys a production value just as effective. Regardless of one's affability to the screenplay, it is undeniable that the visual element of this sequel is worthwhile on its own merit. The effects utilized mesh perfectly with any real-world elements, which all considered may be the best CGI any audience has seen to date. Furthering its grasp on the viewer, all three of cinematography, score, and especially sound perfectly compliment the experience. Also worth praising is the cast, who through their voices and even facial expressions, a great deal of emotion can be felt. Unfortunately, the story itself produces mixed results. There are various intriguing attributes to what happens, and for an action/fantasy film, the battles are satisfactorily intriguing and tension is adequately produced more often than not. Where the plot falters is more so rooted in its surplus of characters, as there is simply too much happening. While there is essentially no one distinguished central role, genuine co-leads and supporting roles number in the double digits. Ultimately, it is clear that the film did not focus on Jake and Neytiri enough; this would have helped maintain a more clear path for the feature to take, while obviously requiring the elimination of at least a couple roles. This being said, each character is enjoyable in their own right. The issue is essentially just that not one is wholly fleshed out, there being all too many subplots to devote adequate time to any. Other more minor flaws are present, as well. Some of the dialogue is poorly written, including the narration that while necessary to understanding the film, does not compliment it in any fashion. There are a couple times where the plot is blatantly furthered, too. Altogether, Avatar: The Way of Water delivers an unreal visual experience that makes the picture more than worthwhile, even as the writing takes a backseat to Cameron's world-building."
"James Camron has set a new bar for visual 3D cinematic excellence. The story flows with enough tension, suspense and physical combat to satisfy your most avid action junkie. Respect for Nature and family values are also an integral part of the story theme. The 3 hour and ten minutes length didn't seem to be that long since the story, it's visuals and screen action kept my interest peaked and made the time fly by. The film should be seen in 3D for best visual effect as it was made for 3D viewing. I definitely plan on buying the 3D blu-ray for my collection when it becomes available. I rate it as a 10- for superior family entertainment."
"This film has been hyped up pretty much ever since the release of the first one more than 10 years ago. The first movie came with some striking new ideas as well as a superb, thoroughly designed storyline. The first movie stood out so strongly that it managed to almost completely separate from all other titles in the sci-fi genre. For the second movie however, almost all of these success factors have been lost, and I'm exception of the striking visuals, I can not find one single thing that may justify the great hype, and the three hour long movie (off course Cameron, let's not miss a thing) manages to squeeze in almost nothing but clichés. Avatar: The Way of Water has efficiently put the stand-alone Avatar concept back into the common sci-fi box, right next to the other endless series of copy-paste Marvel movies and from-beautiful-to-terrible Pirates of the Caribbean collection.Storywise, the grande ""saving-the-world"" plot from the first movie has been efficiently shrunk (a great way to make the concept last for at least a couple of more follow-ups before the hype dies perhaps?) into a fight between a village of a blue-colored Maori tribe, and a big (Australian?) fishing boat. Yeah, big-fish industry sucks and the message of how we should respect animals reaches through for sure. But this seems to cover only the animals we can speak to, or use in some other way. A few scenes later we get to see a pretty big fish flopping around on the spear of a blue kid. All of a sudden, the harmony-with-nature and respect-all-of-life is all gone, and the scene is just a blue coloured copy paste of an ideal American dad going fishing with his kid.Modern CGI has some striking powers, but unfortunately this is almost counter productive when you look at the avatars themselves. Details such as skin texture or hair are so life-like that the Avatars end up looking exactly like human, but with blue painted skin. Couldn't there at least be another skin texture to make them a bit less human-like? Even the old Star-Trek aliens looked a lot less human than these. And let's not even start to dig into why they had to make a down-right copy of Maori culture instead of trying to develop something even remotely new. The main villain is off course a very demanding character to develop as well, so to ease the burden of the insanely high production cost, they simply copy-pasted the dead villain from the first movie. It's amazing what flexibility powers the sci-fi genre brings...The Pandora world is as beautiful as ever, and we get to see even more details of this world than we did in the first movie. It is clear that a lot of effort has been put into making up and designing animals, plants, etc. In a both credible and imaginative way. Even here though, I find several details disturbing when they start connecting to the plot of the film though. Why can they suddenly speak with some fish (aliens whales, sure it's the most likely fish to have a conversation with, but still..) and why can placing some pink jelly-fish wings suddenly make everybody able to breath underwater? I can't help but wonder how these significant details are just thrown in there without further thought, while the details of how spirally alien jellyfish swim or alien whales breath has been insanely thoroughly designed.From the start, the blue-print alien marine-copies become kind of a hard-to-believe start of the plot. Our super-villain has forgotten his professional militarism and any signs of big-picture thinking, and instead gets an intense Jake-fixation pretty early on. Instead of a grande fight, our hero Jake immediately decide to leave the tribe wind for wave, as he is off course the only thing the evil people are after. He goes to live with another tribe far away, but surprisingly, this ends up getting the other tribe in trouble. Lesson learned, apparently hero can not run and must fight. Yes, those were pretty much the exact words of the end scene. Also, bad guy is almost killed, but thankfully he is saved in the last minute by Mowgli/junior Tarzan (?). The end of the movie makes sure to leave no single room for doubt, of course there will be sequels! I bet there are some people who can't wait for an ultra-American, Hollywood sci-fi series without end, but to me these three hours of constant clichés were the last I'll pay for watching. Sorry to let you down Cameron, I understand a more than 10 year hype is hard to meet, but this movie was neither worth the wait nor the money."
I didn't get what was so special about the first avatar. I watched it on blueray on my home cinema and it was pretty mediocre.Now with this one i went to see it in IMAX 3D and THATS what this movie is all about.Its a very special experience and you can tell the movie is only that long because of all the scenes made specifically for 3D. Scenes that could have been easily cut but man arey they a beauty to look at.So in short a movie ALL about the senory experience and less of a movie you watch for its great plot or characters and acting. Not that these are lacking.So either watch this how its supposed to be watched or skip it.
"They say you need to give a detailed argument as to why something is or is not good, why a story is or is not well made and why something is and is not palatable to the viewing experience and for that people usually require you to spoil things, luckily though I have figured a way to neither spoil the movie or its impact while also explaining the story to you so buckle up buckaroos we're into crazy territory now.Remember the first Avatar movie? Yeah, it's bascally that but again with a modest increase in effects and nothing more.And I'm not even kidding on this, it's the same basic plot and its stupid, boring and directly ripping off better movies.And I know that on reading this, most are just going to look at the 3 star and immediately click disagree because most fans of this hack director aren't able to separate things like truth from feeling."
"To say I was excited for this movie is an understatement. Although the first Avatar was massively popular when it was released in 2009, over time people have been more critical of the film but my opinions never really changed. Avatar 1 isn't the greatest movie ever but it's certainly not the worst and it deserves more credit than just being ""Pocahontas with blue people"". I can't say the same for the sequel which is truly a disappointment.We left the first movie with Quaritch dead, the military being expelled from Pandora and Jake permanently being transferred to his Avatar body. The sequel could've gone down so many routes but instead James Cameron chooses probably the least imaginative path to travel: years pass by before Quaritch is back conveniently in Avatar form and is hell-bent on vengeance against Jake Sully. Nothing else motivates his actions (even the matter of Quaritch being a dad is a side note) - Jake is his sole focus and he's happy to spend a fair bit of military resources to get his revenge.Meanwhile, Jake is playing the family man and leader of his clan facing the arrival of new human militia in Pandora when he hears about Quaritch being back and decides to escape to the sea where a different Navi clan resides. What follows is almost three hours following the Sully family by the sea with mostly gorgeous visuals but empty storytelling and plot points that are clearly just set-ups to the many sequels already in the works. Jake's adopted daughter has inexplicable powers, his son befriends what is basically a whale, and the movie then spends a fair bit of time showing the viewer how hunting animals is bad.Not once does Jake reflect on the fact that he was once human and the movie never discusses the internal conflict that may arise since Jake is fighting humans for the most part. His relationship with Neytiri is also barely visited, and Zoe Saldana is criminally underutilised and reduced to simply shouting or crying for majority of her lines.The movie forgets about the human vs Navi conflict which is no doubt happening in the forest areas of Pandora, and glazes over the fact that there's a new resource in town which is coveted for its powers to make humans immortal (this is genuinely only mentioned in a throwaway comment). Instead we are stuck in this fight between Jake and Quaritch which builds up to a lacklustre finale that makes you again realise how small-scale this movie is, even with a $300mil+ budget.Whilst there are some shots which are truly beautiful, after three hours at sea you'll likely wish you were back in the forest again experiencing the weird and wacky wonders the filmmakers previously thought up for Pandora.All in all, this movie was not worth the wait and it'll be a long time until I watch it again. If not for James Cameron's name I most likely would have rated it much lower.The master of sequels dropped the ball with this once. Here's hoping the next 17 sequels are better."
"Possibly the longest I've waited for a sequal. And this is the best Mr. Cameron had to offer. The way of water might be ground breaking in visual effects, no one is denying that, but imagine what this film could have done with actual screen writers. The director's intentions are noble as he's trying to give a (not so subtle)message in this film, to guard our home. But I would have loved to see the other sides point of view. Why are the Humans so desperate to mine this planet? Considering the technology that was show cased in the film(and the first) you would think we would have discovered more planets than Pandora. Planets that are less trouble and perhaps one that wouldn't cost as many lives. I've already put more thought into this film than the writers have. Despite some negativity J. Cameron has gotten lately, it's hard to argue that he's one of the best Directors of our generation, not to mention he might have the best track record when it comes to sequels. But this film was simply put, disappointing.P. S. The only Character I liked in this film was the whale.Story: 5/10 Characters: 3/10 Visuals: 10/10 Pacing: 6/10.Overal: 6/10."
"You get what you pay for.In this case, that truism has double meaning. Cameron spent the last 13 years and an inordinate amount of money making this sequel, and it looks spectacular. And I spent a ridiculous sum to see it on a big screen in 3D, and it was an amazing theater experience. Of course, money can only buy you so much. I knew going in that this movie would likely have the same flaws as the first, so it is hard to complain too much...but the dialogue is sub-par, the movie is too long, there are too many characters, the bad guys are cartoonish, and it still feels like a bad caricature of native cultures at points. But it probably says something that I rarely noticed those flaws. I was too mesmerized by the visuals and action set pieces, which were truly a sight to behold. So yeah: you get what you pay for. I knew what it could/couldn't deliver, and I have no complaints."
"When it comes to James Cameron, the bar is definitely high which makes it easy to disappoint in some way. And I'm not saying Avatar 2 is a terrible movie. However, for me it was a mediocre experience.To sum it all up: A terribly boring villain who has nothing better to do, a story that overall kinda feels like it has been recycled a few times to often. Nothing made me interested in part three. Even the great water visuals didn't change that for me.And yes, I enjoyed the first 'Avatar'. I wouldn't say it had a mindblowing story, but it worked well. And the new 3D at that time was amazing and probably still holds up very well.The sequel on the other hand seemed to me as if Cameron was only interested in depicting live under water. Everything around that kind of felt like he was mixing together various story and character ideas from his previous movies...Also, I'm not a fan of mixing 24fps and 48fps in a movie and a lot of the computer animations feel a lot like video games these days who visually improved a lot during the past 12 years. Don't get me wrong, the under water segments of the movie are visually amazing (aside from the 48fps, which is a matter of taste of course). That alone just wasn't enough for me to enjoy a movie that long. I would have preferred a shorter, more compact movie in that caseSo yeah, it's difficult for me to recommend this movie. For a younger audience it might work better. Or if you are able to fully enjoy the experience and don't get hung up on the storytelling. But still, I think it's one of Cameron's weakest movies on a narrative level."
"This movie redefines the word epic. You will be sucked into the world of Pandora like never before. Breathing the rarified air from James Cameron's own mouth, you will be transported under water in the most amazing sequences ever committed to film. It is a slow-burn movie, but that's a good thing, as the whole 3 hours plus whistle by. Yes, it is an action movie and nobody does action better than JC. It is a rollercoaster ride for your eyes. It has tons of emotion. Don't be put off by the nay-sayers, that it has little plot. Not everything has to be plot-dense! See it in 3d on the biggest screen you can find. You won't regret it."
"This film is a mix of excellent and questionable. Your movie preferences will decide how you balance those facets and so what you make of the film.The visuals are fabulous. Imagination and technical wizardry combine to create a world of beauty that fills the screen with wonder. Avatar had the same quality of course, but James Cameron is in love with water, as we saw with both The Abyss and Titanic.The script is a bit problematic, with too many lines that ring false. That was true with Avatar too of course. But with both films I was so engrossed in the visual wonder to almost not notice the script.The family dynamic at the core of this film adds emotional weight to the events on screen, creating an additional degree of investment in what happens to the characters. Unfortunately that was punctured somewhat by the overused plot device of a child that keeps ignoring his parents and walking into danger.The first half of the film takes the time to create the world of wonder and the relationships that drive events. The second half is a constant barrage of incredible action and edge of your seat excitement. While the action sequences in Avatar are tremendous, The Way of Water somehow surpasses even that high benchmark."
"Another masterclass movie made by James Cameron. If you liked the first you'll absolutely love this one. I can say that the first one did have a little bit better action then this one but the outstanding visual effects eliminates that small downside. This is quite literally as good as a sequel can get. Obviously it's almost impossible to make another Avatar that can single handily beat the first one but this one was close. You'd think for the 3hr runtime that you would get bored watching it but you'd be mistaken, the movie progresses very nicely with tads of action added in here and there. Definitely 9/10."
"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while."
"Writer/Director James Cameron has few peers in respect to the way he consistently delivers quality and thrilling blockbuster entertainment. He's made hit after hit and having seen the Way of Water, he hasn't lost his touch. I wanted to start with the action scenes, we're not only watching Jake and Neytiri take on the ""sky people"" but they're doing it in a different environment and with a new tribe. The action not only brings the punch but it adds some real drama. Watching the hunting of the whales is pretty heartbreaking and reminds you of the consequences should the Na'vi lose. Watching Neytiri and Jake exact vengeance on their enemies hasn't lost it's impact and how Cameron chooses to capture it provides consistent bang for your buck.You can't talk about Avatar without remembering how astounding the visuals were and in many ways still are. Mind-blowing doesn't begin to describe it and it's the primary reason we still get 3D movies today. The lush jungle environment was colourful and vibrant and the creature design was fantastic. Cameron and his team have plenty of tricks still up their sleeve and the new areas of Pandora hold just as many secrets and cool surprises. Cameron's love of the ocean and ocean creatures is widely known and it's a perfect marriage with the material and visual sensibilities of the Way of Water. The beaches and reefs of Pandora are beautiful and so are the creatures that populate it. The environmental message isn't subtle (it wasn't in the first one either) but it's effective and it's hard not to attach yourself because of how they get you to feel through the Na'vi and their care for their planet. I think with all the new visual splendour packed into this movie, no one will walk away from The Way of Water disappointed with what it had to offer visually, in both regular and 3D screenings.We not only follow Jake and Neytiri but a lot of the film centres around their children and how they adapt to their new way of life. As much as their characters are handled with a lot of care, The Way of Water suffers serving too many plot threads. Each member of the family gets a subplot and only a few of them are actually warranted. I don't know how a movie can be this long and have so little cut out yet somehow things are underdeveloped (more on this later). So while learning the new culture is intriguing and there are plenty of exciting sequences, the character development for many of our central players is both undercooked and overcooked depending on which one you're focusing on. I actually found Quaritch's the most interesting (I was hesitant at Stephen Lang coming back even though he was great in the original but bless him for doing so, he's one of the few performers with a noticeable presence here) in his struggle to make sense of reconciling his old identity with his new form. I appreciate the movie reaching for this epic standing by trying to be all things to all people but it just couldn't stick the landing.Getting to what I didn't like about the movie, there's no getting around how bloated The Way of the Water is. The long run time is laborious and while there's plenty to see, there isn't enough here in the story to justify the length of the film. The first thing The Way of Water needed was a tighter cut and I hate saying that with the evident passion that was involved in making this. I already mentioned the unfocused characters but my next biggest beef is how frenetic and distracted the plot is. Characters like Spider and Quaritch get a lot of screen time in the beginning but are just dropped for large amounts of the movie. There were several times that a thread or a character would be introduced and I started getting into it and then they were just gone for a half hour. While Jake and Neytiri are put on the back burner for their less interesting children, I couldn't help but feel distracted wondering how the larger conflict for Pandora was going. How could our heroes could be helping to shape the outcome with the skills they showed in the first movie? Sure, Quaritch's hunt for Jake is important but the conflict isn't even a central focus for the Metkayina. Shouldn't we be more concerned about the soldiers from Earth killing the indigenous species of Pandora and wholesale stripping of the land for human colonization instead of how the Sully family is integrating into this new tribe? On a more minor note, while I like Sigourney Weaver, choosing her to voice Kiri because of her character's lineage was odd and didn't sound right. I'm not blaming her performance, it was just an odd choice for casting and it did throw me off.This movie would have to be spectacular from every conceivable angle to justify the hype. With how long James Cameron and his team were working on it, the money it likely cost and having to live up to the original's success isn't a fair burden for The Way of Water to have to overcome. I walked away having enjoyed a lot about the Way of Water but it has a lot of problems that drag the grade down. James Cameron deserves a ton of credit for his fortitude but I don't know if Avatar's sequel is going to have the staying power or be remembered as fondly. As a spectacle, I'd absolutely recommend catching it in a theatre. But if you're not as eager to return to see the Na'vi and their world, I don't think you need to run to get to the box office. Hopefully we won't have to wait as long for the 3rd entry and while I'm a little disappointed with the Way of Water, I'm more than ready to see the 3rd adventure in this fledgling franchise."
"Avatar: The Way of Water is my first real movie theater experience again in a while, and for the visuals, it was worth it. And I'd like to say it was worth it for the rest as well, but Avatar 2 is like a supermodel who didn't go to school. Surface level it's incredible, but peel away one simple layer and there's nothing there besides a mediocre adventure film.Directing, there's no doubt that this is one of the best looking movies of the year. The water simulation is mind blowing, the world design is stunning. The creature design is great. And the directing takes the freedom to showcase it all, more than you'd want at times. Seriously it's just throwing pretty stuff at you over and over and over. You can't keep that up and keep thinking it engrosses people as much as it did at first. It caused me fatigue. Though I'd have loved a bit more creativity directing wise. Editing and pacing was really really good, but still, the movie overstays it's welcome more than I'd accept. This is mainly due to the the first 50% which is arguably entirely forgettable and even as I'm writing this I'm having a hard time to remember anything notable.The story/characters/script. The weakest part of the movie. Absolutely let down by how surface level everything is kept here. The characters lack depth. The story lacks real stakes until the last part of the movie which it then just rushes through. There's is not a second of suspense to find in this movie. The enemies are deeply incompetent, even though they are marines. You have 3 and a half hours to flesh out the family, but they don't even manage to do that well. We get maybe 1 character trait. No depth whatsoever. Jake Sully is entirely simplified, where did his character go? His wife is even worse. Only one of the kids gets some time, even though again that storyline is played so flat. Not once did this movie bring me to tears either, whilst they had so many opportunities, Kiri's storyline could be sadder, Neteyam could've been more heroic, Lo'ak could've been more cruel en vengeful. Tuk could've been more lost and helpless. But instead scenes either don't get their time, not the emotional load.The story is just so weak, especially as this movie really feels like a primer to the next one. Because in this whole movie they held off 1 medium sized ship. ONE ship. We saw the humans build an entire city with thousands of armored troops. This movie never got it's ''death star'' victory. One of the most anticlimactic ''epic'' movies I've ever seen. Even worse is how they prepared the story for the sequels. Come on... I get the reasoning from the character, sure. I accept that. But the character being saved has no value. Just a grunt bad at his job. He's not smart, doesn't have special intel or abilities. Just as useless as the rest that was given some distinctive features but killed off like fodder.Acting is fantastic, really good performances for what was able to be done with the script. Again though no one really stands out in particular.Music is the same we've heard in Avatar, no real innovation or variation there which let me down a bit. And the problem for me was that the theme became tiresome after it being put under the 100th beautiful scene. We get so many visual '''moments'' it becomes cliché.For someone that hooks into movies more that actually tell a story worth caring about, and characters worth caring about this movie failed for me. It's incredibly simple. A really simple, but pretty looking movie. If that is what you want, it's great. But if you want just a little more out of your movie like me then it's not worth the 3 and a half hours.PS wat might help this movie be worth viewing is watching it in the best theater you possibly can. I don't have that, my theater is mediocre with a flat sounding sound system, and it does make it worse as a ''experience'' movie."
"3 hours 12 minutes filled with visual spectacles, Avatar 2 will WOW the eye out of you with its magical approach on what appears on screen. This is a film that is made for theatrical experience! This is a film that will age well like a fine wine, even in the next 20 years.Remember when you went to an electronic store and you head to the TV section, there are some screens that look profoundly realistic when it moves that it might just pop out of the screen? Yes, imagine watching that for 192 minutes with that frame rate. Everything looks almost real and with the 3D effect, it only adds up insofar it feels practically shot.However, since this might just win the throne for the best visual effects of all time, it comes at a cost, though it is entirely avoidable. The film has plenty of scenes that scream 'flaunting' & 'flexing'. You'll witness scenes that have little to no strong contexts and the only thing those scenes were made are to show how this film has a standard no other films have ever achieved before. It's a bit pathetic but damn, it was enjoyable to watch!Avatar: The Way of Water has a plot that is as par as the standard brought by Avatar 1. It isn't anything special or uniquely different but it is not boring either. However, the message both films want to send out is very transparent. But we can all agree on one thing. The story is not the franchise's strongest asset. The phrase style or I would say, visual over substance is the best way to put it. For instance, during the 45th minute mark or so, there's this 15-minute gap where the story basically turns plateau. It never moves for the sake of feeding the audience with eye-catching visuals. This sacrificial act is uncalled for as this follow up has so much potential to develop the story in a better way. But again, people put way too high expectations for James Cameron.You know that's a James Cameron film when you see one. Other than his trademark of making out-of-the-world blockbuster films, he has his unique ways of tapping into your heart and make you feel a whole spectrum of emotions in his movie; be it sad, happy, angst, anxious, doubts, guilty and the list goes on and on. Similar to Avatar 1, the sequel proves once again that Cameron is talented at telling his story while putting up front the emotional weight as the film goes along.His love towards nature and living things is beyond most humans. Cameron doesn't preach on what he cares but instead, it lets the story moves at its pace and includes the thematic elements on environment, aquatic life and greediness entirely and plays around with them. One thing's for sure though, Leonardo DiCaprio will love this movie for sure. 😉For those of you who want more of Pandora, I'm sorry to tell you that you may be disappointed. Avatar 2 is not a direct sequel and it doesn't want it to be. It sets almost a decade after the event of what happens in the 2009's blockbuster hit. This lies the problem; audience want more of Pandora but Cameron has his ideas on further expanding the world without looking behind at what makes Avatar 1 an outstanding feature. Yes, you get to see Pandora but have little expectations.As told earlier, some scenes are meant to brag about its sheer spectacular that will please the eyes. And bringing up another point, there are also lots of scenes that have jumpy narratives and messy cuts that I found them to be truly annoying. Don't go far, the first 10 minutes will show you how jumpy it is and throughout, they are cuts and splits that can be reorganized and made better. What's the rush, Cameron? You can spend more than 30 minutes flexing on the visuals and yet, the narrative that leads to the answers we've all been dying to know based on the trailer is unclear and lackadaisical.Verdict: Avatar The Way of Water is filled with mesmerizing and never-before-seen visuals accompanied with strong themes that will reflect how greedy and cruel we may (have) become. Yes, James Cameron is the Leonardo da Vinci of our generation and even if the story is nothing exceptional, this film will definitely age like a fine wine."
"Avatar: The Way of Water is an epic and visually stunning film that pushes the boundaries of 3D technology to new heights. Set in the distant future, the movie follows the adventures of Jake Sully, a former Marine who has been given the opportunity to live in the body of a Na'vi, one of the indigenous inhabitants of Pandora.The world of Pandora is a breathtakingly beautiful place, and the 3D effects used in the film bring the stunning landscapes and colorful flora and fauna to life in a way that is truly awe-inspiring. The action sequences are intense and thrilling, and the performances of the actors, particularly Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, are top-notch.Overall, Avatar: The Way of Water is a thrilling and visually impressive film that is sure to be a hit with audiences of all ages. Whether you are a fan of the Avatar series or just appreciate incredible 3D technology, this movie is a must-see."
"I just watched this film and what can I say, it was absolutely incredible! It definitely doesn't feel like 3 hours, as the entire time you are engaged with breathtaking visuals and an amazing storyline! The visual effects in this film are incredible it feels like you are really there! I definitely recommend watching this film in the cinema and DEFINITELY in 3D, it really takes you into the world of Avatar and watching it in that 3D makes it feel like your truely with them! I wouldn't listen to what the critics say, as they nitpick at every tiny little detail. If you are looking for an action packed film with tons of adventure, this is the film for you! And even if your not into the whole action thing, this film is visually stunning with the incredible views and amazing colourful world of Avatar! I do feel like the start of this film was a bit rushed, especially for a 3 hour film they could've done a lot more with the start. That's really the only thing I have to say that isn't good, other than that this film is AMAZING and you have to see it for yourself! Trust me on this one."
Just watched Avatar The Way Of Water and I'm very impressed. Awesome work by James Cameron. Movie felt magical and the Visual effects is just out of this World. Best CGI in cinematic History. Definitely one of the greatest films of all time. Each and every character was portrayed so beautifully and I felt the bond and connection between them . The acting is phenomenal. I really loved the way the animals expressed their emotions in the movie. I watched the movie twice and will definitely watch it thrice to experience the magic and the stunning visuals. Y'all should definitely go watch this movie with your friends and family in 3D. Hats off to you James Cameron and production team .10/10.
"I'm not avatar hater I did like the first movie for the visuals and the story is basic but at least there's beginning and middle also ending. James Cameron I do love his work like Titanic, Aliens, Terminator etc. But this squeal wasn't worth waiting over 10 years for.The problem with this movie the characters just so shallow and forgettable remember how cool Jake in first movie how hes fearless leader but now all he does in this movie keeps belittle his son he spent the last over an hour seriously all he does moron and complain. Spider is just pointless seriously just rip off Tarzan expect with little backstory.Plot? What plot this is basically repeat of first movie expect theres too many plot holes in the film and doesn't do well explaining properly like when did Grace ever had child all I remember last one she died now apparently her child is able communicate how? Why? The film fails to explain it. Villian is basically repeat first movie seriously why would you just copy and pasted.Visuals now they are nice to look at but they ain't as impressive like first time watching the first movie cause just pure CG its nothing special just same thing like I seen before.This is literally the worst movie I watched horrible story, forgettable characters, Visuals nothing special made me appreciate the first one more. It didn't need squeal worked better as standalone movie and 3 hours of this forgettable film lord of the rings did better in story, characters and visual for the trilogy."
"We need more movies like this. What a masterpiece!! I went to see it twice in one weekend. Yes i am a fan of the first movie and i was worried this movie wouldn't live up to the high expectations. Boy was I wrong!! Breathtaking visuals but my favorite thing about this movie is how invested you become with the characters. I will be seeing this again very soon, this must be seen on the big screen. Saw it in 3D and it's truly 3D from start to finish. I want to go see it standard Imax next time. 3 hrs long but it did not feel dragged out at any point in the movie. Thank you James Cameron!!!!!!!!!!!"
"I'm not really quite sure what the hype is about Avatar. I had lukewarm (""meh, it was okay"") feelings about the first movie, and was never really thrilled to come back for the second one. Personally - and this is now firmly within the area of opinion and taste - I find it a little weird that this is a story about White characters being able to inhabit and, literally, become Indigineous bodies. I thought, going in, this would have a stronger climate change angle (""Save Mother Earth!"") but really it's just...I dunno. This movie wasn't for me. And hopefully that's okay. The filmmaking was pretty cool, but... you know, we've had a decade of visually stunning Marvel movies. I don't know what the hype is about."
"This sequel has good graphics, but storywise it no longer has the same impact, and he 3D aspects added nothing extra for me. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful.It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because we follow to many and they do not go in depth to anyone new. In my opinion they should have told the story more in either Kiri or Lo'ak to get a different type of perspective and not a repeat of a battle that already happend in the first movie.The sory also has a a few plot holes, for example: what happend to unobtanium? Every human forgot about the reason they first came to the planet? And the curnal is (almoast) killed, so what? Still crawling with hostile humans. What difference did the battle do for the navi other than save Jakes family(for now)?"
Jake sully integrated into whole Na'vi culture just to become classic patriarch military American dad? Neytiri was not in the picture until the end of the movie she is just agreeing with stuff. Also why all of a sudden everyone speaks English? All teenagers kept saying bro all the time to an annoying level. Hated the plot. They should have looked more into native cultures to make it less white culture. Visuals being good is not an excuse for plot to be this sucky. They didn't even bother with creative villain position and motivation. I also expected Kate Winslet's role to be bigger to train such extreme levels to hold her breath underwater.
"I don't believe I've seen a better made movie technically ever. Saw this in a Laser Ultra theatre in 3D and I was blown away. I implore you to see this in 3D! It is superior to Avatar 1 in almost every way.Story was good, I enjoyed it and found myself on the edge of my seat several times. Cameron is one of the best at creating villains and it is no different here.Avatar 2 looks like a next level video game most of the time, and I felt like I was watching a real world. It is so well done. The human and CGI scenes were flawless.James Cameron is among the greatest filmmakers alive today and I'm very glad he stuck with Avatar. I hope we get to see this series to it's planned conclusion."
"This could easily be an animation for children. The plot and all the storytelling is so cliche so naive and so predictable that If you'd take out the visuals is too boring to watch (and the first half of the movie is really boring and only a child can enjoy it).The second thing - the natives of Pandora are as pathetic as the humans. They presented themselves much better in first Avatar movie. Here they are emotionally unstable, full of anger, unjustified judgments and unreasonable. They don't look like connected to ""their mother earth"". They look like ignorants and savages.I guess Hollywood decided that brainwashing young teenagers is the only goal in art of moviemaking."
"You might think 3 hours is way too long, but once you sit down and start watching Avatar: The way of Water, you would only wish it were longer and longer so that we can all dive ourself into the beautiful Pandora.It's too good to be even called' A fantacy film' or ' Si-Fi film' , this is something at a completely another level. Actually I might go as far as saying you won't even notice the use of CGI, although the film is basically all CGI. It almost feels like you are peeking a different existing world through camera.Back when the first Avatar movie came out, it seemed to be ahead of the time by 10 years. Now I watched The Way Of Water, I just can't help thinking this is still ahead of our current time, ahead of all the other movies by ten years.Everything is perfect, I have nothing more to say. We are blessed to have directors like Cameron who would devote themselves in movies and always strive for a more perfect picture."
"The visual experience was great, as expected but somehow, it felt inferior to Avatar 1 which was made way back in 2009. The most disappointing thing about this Avatar was that it didn't feel like the aliens we came to love, instead they acted more like human - might as well have painted human blue. The Spider character should never been put there; first of all, he seems so misfit with Avatar, second he acts more like Navi people than the actual ones, third he is so irritating and fourth, it looks weird and less likely that he could go around like them no matted how 'adapted' he was. The plot is so bad; how can Jake just run away with his families? First of all, why the hell didn't Toruk Motu unite all the clans and better prepared themselves (they actually have human scientists to help them too)? Didn't Jake not know Sky people may come back, did not even consider it? They were able to unite 2000 in a day during first war but nothing happened for years? What if after they fled, the people they left behind were questioned and killed asking for their whereabouts? What sense does it make, really?Don't even get me started about bringing back Miles as villian! They couldn't find another one? Okay, he was brought back but the weaker version than the first? How does that make sense? He warns Jake twice to come alone or else, he will kill his children and both the time, his wishes are not met. And both the times, he could keep his words but no, it is just empty threat.James Cameron I believe said that unlike superheroes movies, the stakes are truly high here and noone is safe. Is that a joke? Only one person, who is important relationship wise but not significant in character development or screen time dies - rest one way or another, there is always miraculous escape- more weird saves than superheroes movies.The 5 stars is for the hard work which was clearly put there but alas, there was so little to celebrate. Hopefully Avatar 3 might be better.Kate Winslet avatar looked nothing like her and she seemed like a cameo which is a shame. And Miles actually looked like Jake avatar that for first few scenes, I was confused.PS Even Thanos came for only two movies and he was much more formidable than Miles ever was, for crying out loud. I am almost tempted to bet that Miles maybe villain for Avatar 4 as well."
"No pun intended - and finally the second part of ... I actually have no idea how many are planned or rather will be released! It's been over a decade since the first Avatar came out. Now for those amongst you who are fans of Anime and may have issues with this movie and its title: I am not to blame! I just repeat the title that the movie is given - that does not change the fact that you may feel there is only one Avatar (and it not being this right here).That out of the way (again no pun intended here either), the movie picks up where the first one left off. Imdb apparently has a two page summary from the first movie. I do not think you really need it. When the first one got re-released a couple of moths ago, I thought I would wait until December and watch a double feature ... part 1 and 2 that is ... well I was wrong. I was wrong in the sense that cinemas did not do the double features and me re-watching the first one. Which I already watched twice in cinemas (which is more often than many other movies) ... once in Imax too - the extended version. I wonder if there will be an extended version of this one too ... not like over 3 hours aren't enough already.That all aside and onto the story ... well I won't really reveal anything here - especially because even though I had heard that this tried to put more story into the movie ... well it didn't feel like it. This is as paper thin as the first one. Maybe it does have a bit more story ... but it also has a more than a few repeats too. No pun(s) intended - we get quite a few callbacks and you may wonder if anything has consequences anymore.But you may wonder and say: that all sounds negative. Well I do not know what to tell you. I am just trying to be as real as possible. You are not going to watch this to be blown away by the story ... you will watch it for the visuals ... bro! If you don't get that reference ... bro ... well you clearly haven't watched the movie yet ... bro.The movie has subtitles but it does use the trick we got introduced by 13the Warrior .. the movie with Banderas. Where he learned a new language .. and we as viewers ""learned"" it with him ... and therefor got treated with everyone talking English in the end ... or in the beginning, if you erase the pun I used.Back to the visuals though: this looks and sounds amazing ... bro. Although when I say sounds, you may have issues with some of the dialog. Or the relationships between characters ... or how they act and react to certain things. Or how they treat each other! Like having a prisoner ... but letting them do whatever they want to ... it is mind boggling to say the least.Then there is the cringe factor ... be it certain characters or what they say and do. The question is, do you mind or even care? Because I assume you are here to have fun ... and that is why I rated it so high ... I know for some it is still too low. And it is the same score I gave the first one. Which I also really enjoyed ... for what it is or was ... which does not mean I did not see the flaws or was not aware of them ... I just rated the entertainment and visuals a bit higher ... the amount of craftmanship that went into making the movie ... incredible! Why not enjoy it, even if it has things in it, that make my skin crawl? Be aware of what you are about to watch ... and everything should be alright ... until the next one comes out!"
"I went on a family cinema event for 64 Euro only for the tickets, and I don't feel that the movie was the money worth.Ok, first the positiv.The sound is stunning and a worthy experience. Unfortunately is it unusual to pay only for the sound on the cinema ticket counter.The optic is almost perfect, but with some scenes which are looking really awful. Due to the fact that almost the whole movie is made with CGI is it necessary to make look really perfect. Unfortunately look some scenes like scenes direct out of the good old Wing Commander III. Yes, it its time it was a fabulous game, but it doesn't match the current standards. Those scenes break the movie magic, because you see and you feel that the thing is artificial.Ok, let's go the weak story.1. There is no plausibel reason why the humans don't use an kinetic strike from the orbit to eliminate all the Navi.2. The story is almost the same one like in the first movie. Now are learning Sully child instead of him and they learn how to adapt.3. The reason why the humans are back isn't clear, but they're three options.3.1 The Humans are back to colonize Pandora as new homestead for humankind.This option would explain why no nukes are used but it still doesn't solve the kinetic strike issue. Further more would this option prefer pandora without the Navi. So why don't extinct them?3.2 The Humans are back for Unoptanium. This reason isn't mentioned in the movie but is still present. Still doesn't solve the kinetic strike option.3.3 They're back to earn some live extending solution from whales. Ok, I think you guess it by yourself. It doesn't ....4. The remaining humans were living for over the years in an hazardous environment. Where does the supplies coming from?5. In the first movie, the scientist needed pilots to operate the helicopters, but now they can fly them self. I think piloting a helicopter must be very easy.6. The colonel is back due to a backup of his mind. Those backup can be uploaded in an Avatar body or in an cloned one. So, why do they need those magic live extending solution when you can live forever in you clones?7. Character development. In simple words. I don't care about the characters in the movie. One dies? Who cares?Conclusion: Soulless eye candy."
"Scifi manure is the best I can come up with.First movie had a good story, high end CGI but also number of slightly demented scenes that made me regurgitate all good feelings I altready had and leave bad taste of cliche acid in the mouth. Although super sci-fi lover I could not bear seeing that film more than 3 times before thinking about deleting bunch of scenes all the time. Well - ok at that time - under those circumstances - but it never went into anthology collection - it just stayed where it belongs - video game with good story and acting.Like video game that doesn't deserve sequel - here comes puked abomination to cash in on previous success. While in the first movie I was denied feelings I had developed to the characters and the story - here I got empty bowel of manure. Digital manure.Sorry - walked out - this is not worth my time."
"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters."
"The story was the same as Avatar 1. There were the same exact scenes as in Titanic with water rising up and people running away. Lots of mother earth love. Whale hunting is bad. Destroying forest is bad. Military is bad. National geographic styles at some points. I think the character of Spider will be made fun of for his entire life. It was such an embarrassing character. I could not take that character seriously.Apparently 98% of the villains who came from earth as military were white, muscular, and had an American accent. That is not a true representative of people on earth. Best part of the movie was my popcorn."
"If you are a cinematography technologist, this is an absolute must see in Real 3D HFR. It is the best technical implementation of 3D in a feature length movie - that I have ever seen. The 3D shorts at DisneyLand and DisneyWorld were better. The blocking and editing honed for 2D 24FPS doesn't work for 3D HFR.REALITY CHECK:
Avatar-1 was perhaps 75% cultural, dealing with psychological perspectives, and incorporating many traits of indigenious Earth cultures, which are only palatable to Americans -- when made alien.Rewatching Avatar-1, I found that it plays much better today than 14 years ago, since environmental issues are front and present for a majority of Earth population.Avatar-2 is 66% a wannabe Marvel Comics festival of video-game violence. The digital effects at HFR - in action scenes - look like a video game. But then, that is probably the intended market, where the huge investment in 3D CGI will end up.To paraphrase another movie -- ""If you buy it, they will make it.""
""Show Me The Money!"" -- the motto of every major movie studio. Disney is no exception.Violence sells. Emotional intelligence does not. Thus, humanity is in a perpetually downward spiral into self-annihilation. E.g., people would rather watch Woody Allen's psychosis, than watch anything about the Dalai Llama. Mike Judge got it right with -- IDIOCRACY![Okay, now I have satisfied the 600 word quota.]"
What an amazing journey in theater it is like going to a magical world i have loved every minute of the movie. The emotion in this movie is soo good that you will feel connected with the characters. For me personally i loved Payakan (Whale) more than anyone in the movie he is MVP of the movie the way the director showed his emotion to the boy who saved his life the way he showed his intelligence to deflect the attacks launched by the attackers and how he manages to go on to ship and kill most of the villains most importantly i loved the scene where he gets killed that creatures intelligence were out of the box. Amazing he was perfect.Payakan just stole the show from everyone.
"Let's face it- there are Pixar movies with more heavy driven story than this one. Avatar: The Way of Water is not complex- it's very easy to follow what is happening on screen.And OMG- the screen! I don't know how he achieve this, but James Cameron once again gives us such amazing entertainment that we will remember if not forever, at least for a very long time. I had the opportunity to watch the film in IMAX and I can say that technically the film is polished to perfection. The 3D is crisp and deep. From the camera movement to the music, Cameron presents Pandora in such a way that once again proves to us why he is a pioneer in the genre. The underwater scenes are so immersive that at some point I expected Sir David Attunborough to start explaining what is the migration cycle of the tulkuns.Can't wait for the third movie of this installment."
"Absolutely incredible! From my humble opinion, this is way better than the first installment. Everything feels so personal since it centers around the life of Sully Family. This feels closer to home, finding ways to protect your family against atrocities.Te Visuals It was insane!! James Cameron once again proved he is the 'King of Cinematography'. It still has the same feels with the first part, but 3x better I would say. Such an astonishing visuals. My personal favorite was the navi's connection to the aquatic life, like it feels emotional and therapeutic at the same time. The visuals really helped in setting the mood and making everything feel surer real!!"
"Its sleepy. Time wasting, and the detail is lame
. No plot twist tho,and the ending is not so good. From someone who loves movies and grades them a bit harsher than most others I have to say Avatar The Way of The Water was a cinematic failure at best.The introduction of characters were horrific, they introduce characters, but they did not build upon them, for a 3 hour long movie, you should be able to build upon the characters instead of introducing a character, and hinting at another character which can build a special relationship, friendship with them both. But they didn't do that here, instead they introduce characters and left them as is and moved on to a different plot."
"Saw the first ""Avatar"" back in 2009 and it was different and did impress me as it introduced the moon of Pandora, and new like blue creatures, not a bad movie nor nothing great it just wasn't my cup of tea. Still decided to watch the sequel ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" and it was filled with action, drama, and beautiful scenes as the art work, cinematography, and CGI special effects were in top notch form as seeing it on a big screen entertains you more as it's a watch for any movie fan especially a sci-fi one. The story was interesting with drama as Jake travels to fight on the moon planet and save the entire village. Overall nothing great with substance still it's style is an entertaining treat on the eyes."
"Too many times in story I was like ""don't do that or don't go there""..""why did you have to"". . ""how obvious"".. They make things people in normal world wouldn't.. Why don't make story not predictable and boring from that standpoint?Yes, the movie is very touching (and it's all the point), to get you mentally shooked (i ain't, and i wonder how people can live in real world if they start crying from fictional story).3D is best of the class, way better than any other Film.CGI and world, perfect👍🏻
If story was better (not so annoyingly predictable) this movie would get full 10. Now it only gets 9.I will go and watch this again and in way this was meant to, 3D!!Hopefully Avatar 3 has better story."
"The good: Visually it looks simply breathtaking, love the new places, new animals, the fight scenes in particular (especially the end one) is incredible. The attention to detail is really good in sounds as well, you can hear everything from the shell casings to the clinks of metal when they reload, very detailed. Soundtrack is also really really good, even though it borrows a lot from the first movie. I also liked some of the new characters.The bad: Oooh lawd, where do I begin. The story is very shallow and has sooo many plot holes, I was constantly wondering wtf was going on (why didn't they shoot Jake at the end and instead let him go in the water, why didn't they track Spider's helmet like they said they could and instead let themselves get trapped, why is the whale liquid the only reason they're there and no one even MENTIONS unobtainium, why does Jake and his whole family just abandon their clan with no second thought and leave them to die??? Wtf). Also the whole plot point with the ressurected colonel and Grace was veeery far fetched. But the worst of all was the dialogue, which was atrocious with a few good moments.The script is beat for beat very similar to the first one's script. The ""being chased by foreign new animal"" from the first one (Jake chased by the black panther thing) turns into an underwater chase, very similar. The burning of the tree in the first one (the emotional gut punch) is the whale fight now. A lot of borrowed or straight up copied lines (I see you, We are not in Kansas anymore, Spider teaching his dad to talk na'vi like neytiri tought Jake).And then there's the things that are done worse than in the first one, which there are quite a few. The battle scene at the end is cool but not as powerful or epic as in the first one. The buildup is very slow, sometimes it felt like it was taking FOREVER to get to the next plot point, while in the first one it felt natural and emotional. The language? In the first one they spent so much time exploring this language and world, it really felt like the na'vi were so different than us. Now everyone speaks english and acts like human teenagers do, what.So all in all I would say it was ok, could have used some work to get to the good territory. But compared to the first one which is a strong 9/10 for me, it is far behind it in almost every area except visuals."
"James Cameron successfully shaped the personality of each character. I like their distinctive way of action very much. Some people don't like the impulsive decisions made by the characters. But they didn't go to college. They are pure in nature, isn't it?The visual world is also very attractive. Avatar is very elegant. Their faces are like cats, their eyes are big, and very cute.I doubt myself when the hunter says Tukun's Essence can keep mankind young forever. Destroy the beauty of other lives for the sake of human's own beauty. That's sad.I want to discuss his philosophy of life and environment, A very rare world view, They enable living things and the natural environment to sense each other. They come from the sea and die into the sea. You can see the whole life system from several characters.I'm delight to have the chance to see this movie."
"Just saw it last night and just wow... the 48fps during the fast moving action sequences was mind blowing. Even if you don't like the ""Avatar story"", this is worth the watch just for the ground-breaking mix of CGI and 48fps. The movie even slows down to 24fps (the usual film speed) for dramatic scenes. A technical marvel and makes MCU movies' CGI mediocre (and even bad) in comparison.The first one was never one of my favorite movies, but this one is just so immersive, I'd definitely recommend it just for how revolutionary it is, technologically speaking. I also love how the majority of the main characters are all ""aliens"" and we buy into it instantly. Years ago if a character was CGI it would look ""off"", but this movie proves that CGI has gotten to a breathtakingly believable level and I'm here for it."
"This movie had such potential, but at several points, there was just such an incredibly flawed execution. I am a huge fan of James Cameron's earlier work and I enjoyed the first Avatar movie. For years leading up to this movie, James Cameron stated that he needed to wait several years before the release of Avatar's sequel because he needed for technology to be able to be up to par with his vision. While we have waited so many years for this and have came into this movie with a hunger and we were fed to a degree, we still feel a little bit hungry. For the fact is, we were entertained, but deep down we were not fulfilled. There was so much ideas with great potential, but they are not fully explored. The movie is a bit strange for me because there was such a long running time, but many of the thematic elements felt rushed and unfinished. It's almost as if he had too much to say.I think that in comparison to Avatar 1, the character development was on the weaker side. The personal transformation of Jake Sully was much more interesting to watch. We have watched several characters in the film be more round, dynamic characters that change. We grow to like these people and grow invested in the personal growth that they make. There is a part of us that enjoys that someone who is a part of the system realizes the terrible nature of it and rebels against it. However, a part of the problem with this movie is that there is no real character development and the characters are much more flat. There is a bit more of a focus on the coming-of-age element, but there is no growth for these characters. From the onset, the son who dies at the end is seen a risk taker who rebels, but he ultimately has a very good heart. It is not surprising that he has come to sacrifice himself for others. There is no real growth that comes that brings him to his death. Furthermore, you do not feel a true sense of tragedy in the classical sense when the son dies. For in the greatest of tragedies, there was a great tragic flaw that managed to bring this person down and bring a profound sense of loss. The only real sense of loss I felt was the loss of young potential since he seemed like a young person with potential; however, this is not a wholly original theme. You must juxtapose this with the fact that Cameron's ego seems to make us suggest that this cinematic experience was supposed to be transformative.Another big gaping hole is just the logic of the ending. Think of it like this. Jake Sully has to escape from the forest clan because he needs to protect his family and knows that wherever he goes, there is going to be a definite risk. Jake Sully knowingly brought a war to the sea clan and those people were reluctant to accept him; however, those people allowed him to live there just because the leader happened to be a nice person. Allowing Jake Sully to live there did incur the death of some of their people and their fish that have been described as ""soul sisters."" Then, all of a sudden toward the end, there is this concept of, ""Oh, your son died on our ancestors' land and was taken onto it, so you are now a part of us."" This is an incredibly strange concept given the fact that much of the movie showed this almost racist tension from the sea people against the forest clan people and people who are deemed to have ""demon's blood"" (human) in them. Then, there is the fact that they have bullied the son that ultimately died and actually almost killed him. I think that it is interesting that he decided to transition to becoming a part of the sea clan, but it just was done so rapidly and without anything to it that would be logical.The other thing too is that there is just a much more drastic tone taken to this. While the first Avatar movie whispered its social themes to you, this one is loudly screaming it to you as if it is a raging sermon. While I do believe that the social issues in the film are ones worth exploring, it is done in a way that is almost insulting to the viewer's intelligence because everything is broadcasted directly. The villains' motives are clearly advertised to you from the onset and the characters themselves seem almost cartoonish with no depth. The one interesting element of the metaphysical identity of the question of a clone being able to be a father was not truly explored. A lot of interesting paths are taken, but they're not brought to satisfying resolutions. James Cameron is trying to throw a bunch of things at you at a machine gun pace, but he does not truly develop and nurture these themes. I wanted to see the theme of racism and discrimination explored, but it is done on such a superficial level because James Cameron seems concerned about trying to explore the themes of family on a superficial level too. The ambition is truly admirable for such a mainstream film, but it needs to be done much smoother.I did enjoy some of the action scenes at the end, but you meandered through a lot of scenes that could have been condensed to get there. Then, during the action scenes, there are parts where the action is broken for a little bit with unnecessary shots and exposition before returning to the stunning action. Unfortunately, it seems like the best was saved for last when the beginning and middle parts of the films could have benefited from such excitement. Then, the nature of the dialogue left a lot more to be desired because someone in the industry as seasoned as Cameron could have truly wrote better lines. The acting also just was so stiff, especially from the female general. You do not feel this aura of authority or greatness as you would expect from a general. For those who watched Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood, General Armstrong is a presence that certainly comes to mind.The problem is that the director advertises this as a transformative experience and he clearly took great enjoy in bringing his vision to life. There are so much impressive elements to be seen here in terms of the visuals, but the thing is that it does not feel truly revolutionary. The coming of sound in cinema is revolutionary. The transition into color is revolutionary. Seeing Lawrence of Arabia is revolutionary. Nothing is a truly revolutionary experience here and does not transform us. In this day and age where we are jaded by all the media that we see, we want to be a part of something revolutionary and historical that truly disrupts our conscious. We are not given enough of these characters to be able to truly relate to them other than what we can glean from the obvious symbolic tropes they are meant to represent. There are bits and pieces of other films here; for instance, I have seen elements of Waterworld, How To Train Your Dragon, and Titanic to name a few, Many cinematic texts try to use their allegories in order to contribute to the societal conversations of how we see our world and can improve it. Is James Cameron doing anything unique with this move in that regard? No. He became so immersed in the technology of story telling that the soul of what makes a good story is missing. This is good, but not great.Rating: 6.5/10."
"Visually, this movie is a masterpiece. The way they craft the world and the people is unique. From the forest, to the sea, this movie is something to behold. Watching the characters swim pass an endless parade of interesting and beautiful creatures was a treat!However the story, much like in the original, is incredibly lacking. Humans are bad, save a few. The Na'Vi have something valuable the humans want. Conflict, fight scene with crazy machines and animals, then conclusion.There's an apparent refusal to recast. Cast include blue Sigourney Weaver, blue general guy, and a few other blue faces that are indistinguishable from the rest. This felt like nothing but a cash grab. Big flashy scenes, with very little substance.This is a ""do not bother"" for me. Wait until it's available to stream. It's not bad, just not able to live up to the hype."
I'm not kidding this film was very good looking and it's not just a looks it was worth my money to go to this movie it was a little hard to pay attention since I went with a freind so i will give a deeper reviw later but still this is one of those If you love avatar your going to cry. Again great performances from all the cast.i forgot why is the villan blue in the movie? I love the introduction of the water people in this movie. I wonder what this next avatar is going to be about and also wonder how good the next one is going to look remember the last film took ages to make that ment they had ages to perfectly do cgi but I don't know.
"I wasn't expecting much from ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" when I went to see it today (Regal Westbury, NY) so I can't say that I was disappointed. I'm not the biggest fan of the first one and I figured ""The Way of Water"" would just be more of the same and that's what it is. The movie looks good but it never feels real. A lot characters kind of look the same so I got a few mixed up once in a while. The dialogue is really bad. It's filled with a bunch of ""bro"" and ""cuz"" that sound corny and out of place in this fantasy word. And course, it's too long. That said, I'm glad I got to see this movie in 3D. I'm a big fan of 3D and on that level ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" delivers."
"The movie was really well made technically wise, with amazing CGI.But like the first one, the story is just horrible. Avatar 1 was just Pocahontas on an alien world.This one is just pocahontas 2 with an even worse story.I watched it and thought the effects were cool and the 4D max experience was aweseome....for like 30 min. Then it became tiresome.After 1 hour I was reaslly looking at my watch wondering if this story was ever going to end.The whole water tribe thing seemed dumb to me. If they had lived on the same world for so long, how come they have never interacted with each other before? I heard the next one is going to be ""fire tribe"". Oh God, please no.Watch it for the techical experience. But I would never ever want to put my eyes on this ""film"" again."
"You know how in the ""new"" star wars movies
the force awakens,
the rise of skywalker, etcthey took the exact same epic story they used in the original moviesand copy pasted it in a horrible waytrying to make it better with cgi and removing or killing anything good that was with the original movies ?So that.Only 3 houres long.Not a waste of time but not as good as the first one
save your money and see it on your home 4k tv with a much better resulotion.In the cinema in normal projectors that show full hd or less, its a waste of money and the graphics dont look nearly next gen as the first one."
"Genre
Science FictionAdventure+ Surprisingly good for its length. Another universe to disappear into - just like in the first Avatar
+ Bleedingly beautiful
+ MotionCapture was shot underwater in all the scenes (60%) where the action took place underwater, This required completely new technology/ According to James Cameron, the Avatar sequels were such a massive undertaking that he divided the four scripts between the writing team of Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, Josh Friedman, and Shane Salerno. Cameron delve further explaining the story process: ""I think we met for seven months and we whiteboarded out every scene in every film together, and I didn't assign each writer which film they were going to work on until the last day. I knew if I assigned them their scripts ahead of time, they'd tune out every time we were talking about the other movie
/ Of the 3,240 effect shots Weta Digital did, 2,225 involved water.A little too inflatable world, with a touch too little knowledge. Especially considering how long ago Avatar came out.The whole film is just a little too hyped. Eye candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.Sometimes a bit wierd psysics."
"James Cameron's first film in over a decade probably could probably not help but come across as somewhat disappointing, especially when compared to his previous track record with sequels. The much lauded CGI work is certainly incredible to see, but it lacks the driving intensity of last year's Top Gun: Maverick and really shows that computer effects have their limits: no matter how incredibly real it looks, there's always some degree of unreality. Much of the Avatar: The Way of Water plays like an animated film or cartoon, and the almost complete lack of normal human characters only amplifies this problem.But make no mistake, this is a film that only James Cameron could direct, a potpourri of all his usual ingredients: oceans, environmentalism, guns, romance, cutting edge effects, strong females, etc, all married to a slavish earnestness that sets his vision apart from the snark-fests that usually fill theaters. During the scene when they all swim out to converse with the giant whales it's easy to laugh, but Cameron never makes fun of his own world-that's his greatest strength. Maybe he can go too far in trying to play with the audiences emotions (not only are the whales highly intelligent, they are also deeply emotional and artistic-oh yes, and complete pacifists as well) but the overall effort still benefits from his archetypical storytelling instinct.The battle at the end was a bit of a letdown. Cameron is still an incredible action director; the fight scenes in Avatar 2, despite the constant computer effects, have a physicality that surpasses nearly all modern blockbusters. He knows how to stage violence in a way that feels impactful and weighty, unlike films such as Avengers: Infinity War, where giant machines are made to crush whole digital armies and it barely registers with the viewer. The problem with his climax here has more to do with context and structure. The battle in the first film was clearly a military fight, a legitimate war between the humans and the Navi. In the sequel, the Navi wage epic battle against...a whaling vessel? Sure, it's armed to the teeth and has a squad of undead hostile marines onboard, but its still feels significantly less threatening than the bomber ship in the original. Cameron doesn't help by making it less a battle and more a full-on massacre; the humans don't seem to really get their hits in this time around, and as the violence gets more and more severe, I began to wonder if they really deserved all of it. I kept waiting for some sort of twist to happen, reinforcements to arrive, but no, Cameron instead scales back to focus on his characters.This leads to another problem with the film, which is this shift to character-driven storytelling. The first film, despite all that snarky, parroted criticism of recycled plot elements, worked due to its concise storytelling and linearity. The sequel falls back on a very TV-show style soap opera where the plot is driven by the twisty relationships among the characters. It's too open ended, feels somehow smaller and less important, as if Cameron deliberately shied away from depicting more interesting themes (how does Jake feel leaving his humanity and original home behind?) in favor of 'relatable' family dynamics. Despite what some people think, this focus on 'character' is incredibly easy to do over a long runtime and is also very unremarkable. It's not that the characters in the film are badly written, it's just that the plot never demands anything really interesting from them, in true TV show fashion. At the end of the day all that's left are the effects, straining to add humanity to motion-capture aliens and only partially succeeding."
"Wow, just wow. I saw this movie last
Night and the visuals were stunning and at a level I have never witnessed before.Avatar is the best 3D graphics I have ever seen in my life. And the level of animation is next level. It's also the best animation ever.James Cameron is a visionary and a genius.You have to watch this movie in the theatre and in 3D. Our theatre even had vibrating seats and that so perfectly time. The story line and action were epic. It was very exciting, emotional, and captivating. This was a movie experience. No this is not a paid advertisement. I was just so blown away, which rarely happens with a movie."
"I almost didn't go see the film due to some critics like the one from the BBC News who called it a 'damp squib'. He said there is action in the beginning and then nothing. How wrong was he! There was action throughout the whole movie. The times when there wasn't action was story building and setting the scene. The film is visually stunning, I have never seen anything like it. I was lucky enough to see it on an IMAX screen and it blew me away. The detail in the nature and the creatures and people and the Na'vi (the blue characters) was breathtaking. Watching the movie is like looking at a masterpiece painting in a museum. Every scene is beautiful. I can understand why it took so long to make. Definitely worth the wait. Very entertaining and this is what I pay money for."
"I will admit the story is not the most gripping at the start, but I guess that's due to it being a recap after ten years and also an intro into the new story .... So the first hour or so is about a 7-8 out of 10 ....but that last hour? BOY OH BOY ... my jaw dropped and just stayed there permanently, got married, bought a house, had kids ... I'm not a film critic ... but here's my two cents: to produce a *good* sequel when the first film was, for lack of a better word, EPIC, is hard enough as it is .... But to do it TEN years later and still have it be as good as this is... I think is pretty groundbreaking and it has definitely surpassed the standards of any other sequel I've seen."
"When I was a 9-yr old kid, I saw the first part and thought, man, this is a once in a lifetime kinda experience. Now, after 13 yrs, with a bit sharpened and matured mind, once again have stepped into the Pandorian world and boy, didn't it deliver much better than the first one? Salute James Cameron, probably the finest film-maker out there who really knows the nuances of storytelling and is a master in using VFX to enhance it. Talking about the story, plot and run-time which everyone is worried about, well, for me, it was like a family union, with so many underlying basic human emotions, but the standout one has to be ""FAMILY IS OUR FORTRESS"". Technically speaking...come on, do I have to talk about it? It's probably the best cinematic experience I have ever had in recent times, sadly there's no IMAX in our Telugu states. Book your tickets in the best theater possible, grab a bucket of popcorn and drink and get immersed into the Cameron's cinematic sorcery and spectacle."
"Enjoy the stunning visuals and don't worry that you're watching pretty much the exact same story as last time; colonizers are bad, natives are good, fantastic third act battle sequence. This movie is such a copy of the original they brought nearly everyone back, whether they lived in the first one or not. Techno babble, flashback, memory recall, video recording, whatever, if they were in the first one it's a good bet they get at least a scene in this one. Maybe bring some gummies so you're not looking at your watch after 2.5 before the final battle. They could easily cut 40 minutes from the opening act that they did not need. I know they have to give screen time to the new characters but Zoe Saldana's character, so important to the first movie, is stripped of time and importance."
"James Cameron's magnum opus deserved an early morning watch & so I caught the first day first show. It's an understatement to say how perfectly Cameron has delivered his spectacle. Continuing from where it ended, Jake Sully is now a family man & has continued his war against the Sky people who have returned along with familiar faces. As the battle get intensely personal, Jake chooses a temporary solution to protect his family as that is what a father does. This leads to the introduction of the Reef people & their own Waterworld. How Jake & family fit in the new world, the battle that follows up adds up to the epic tale.Once again Cameron mesmerizes with the underwater sequences which he is an expert at. The characters are again lovable & there is an instant connect to each of their storyline, standing out is Spider. The 3D is crystal clear & honestly gave out never seen before experience once they move in with the Reef people. The runtime shows & that will remain my only complaint if I've to nitpick. It succeeds in building up the story for the sequel."
"Of course the 3D effects are good here, although I prefer the original Avatar. There's something about the new version that seems too clinical visually. There is a story but it doesn't grab the viewer. When watching this 3 hour epic I found myself wondering how much longer it would drag on. The biggest problem for me was the lack of real actors. Of course the voices of prominent actors were used but in the original Avatar film the viewer could actually see most of them. In ""The Way of Water"" we see mostly computer generated Avatars. After a while this becomes boring because these creatures look very alike."
"First things first. If u expect a Nolanesque level story then this movie is not for u. There is no ground breaking story. It's the same hero kicks the villain's rear cliche but in a different Avatar ( pun intended). That been said,the Avatar franchise as we all know is about the cinematic experience. The visuals in the movie are surreally smooth thanks to the HFR 3d format. I was gobsmacked for the major part of the movie about what I saw on screen. The world of Pandora just springs to life and it's enthralling. Keep ur story expectations to the minimum and just enjoy the experience. Watch it in Imax 3d for the best possible experience."
"Well I could not believe my ears when I heard Avatar 2 was finally coming out. I had so much excitement to see this movie, especially when I knew James Cameron was making new technology to film under water. It's a 3hour+ movie, definitely did not feel like that. The time flew by! The detail to the visuals are as insane as the first one, the story line was great, especially when the villain was the same from the first movie (which made total sense how they brought him back) and the acting is superb, so damn believable. And it's filled with a lot of emotional scenes, thanks to James Cameron and the actors.One of the best films I have seen in a long time. James Cameron did not fail in the return of Avatar. I can't wait to the many more he makes!"
"Pros:
Better CGI I think? Looks goodKids are fun and cuteCreatures designsCons:
Same movie but in the waterLong scenes of contemplating things you already sawA slog overallSame dumb villain because let's just forget the giant cities on Pandora right?Plot elements are just dropped because F consistencyJustifications for anything are dumb as possible (why does leaving the Tribe protect the people? Did Jake think humans would leave the planet or what?)Cameron never heard of Chekhov's gun apparently, he will give you 10 rather cool ideas to pick from and do nothing with themAnything that would make the movie good is unused. Payakan? Will never convince his tribe to help. Kiri being a freak? Used ONCE. The biologist who should help? Jokes once and disappearsKiri, one of the few interesting characters, is just ignored because ""epilepsy"", when everyone actually knows what she does with the plants and animals. Makes no senseYou're supposed to care about characters you see twice, shout out to the older sonSpider, why?"
"Totally disappointed with the sequel. No story line , one gear pace, same
Old
Concept
Of avatar first with this time water. First part pace was damn good as compare to
This
Part. I fell asleep many times between the movie. Too long to bear . James cameron thinks people still living in 2009 but in these 13 years, wholesome of cinema change with respect to story and vfx. The only good part of the movie was it's vfx . Only hype of this
Movie attracting the audience. Expected more
From james. Hope next part will bring some
Good movie concept and shorter length movie. Super boring, super sleepy with same concept. Don't recommended by me.save your
Time and money."
"I loved the first movie because it was visually spellbinding, creative, joyful, filled with wonder and magic. I did not like the character of the menacing jerk who was so ridiculously one dimensional. I felt it cheapened the movie. But overall I loved it.If you take everything that was wonderful about the first Avatar and quarter it and take everything that was awful and quadruple it, I so regret to say you end up with The Way of Water.It is beyond me why the second movie had to be a repeat of the first in plot. Couldn't Cameron think of any other drama? Maybe a natural disaster hits Pandora or something?Once again, a movie I felt could be great instead s geared towards 14 year old boys."
Beauty with a soul!Do watch Avatar The Way Of Water if you haven't already. It doesn't really matter if you are one of the very few people like me who haven't seen the first part that came way back in 2009.This film has an emotional depth along with the gorgeous visuals. It has you captivated for the entire duration in spite of its length being over 3 hours. It is easily the most beautiful film you would have ever seen leaving you in complete awe.Watch it on the biggest screen possible. It is really needless to say that it is a masterpiece and technical marvel. Might watch this one again.
"13 years back, James Cameron revolutionized the visual effects in cinema with Avatar which broke all the box office records thanks to solid word of mouth. He is back and is back with another spectacle that will blow your mind ...In Avatar 2, Jake has moved on with his new lease of life in Pandora and is living happily with Neytiri. However, his happiness is short-lived as the new threat enforce into their world and he must work with Na'vi race to protect their world.To refresh your memory, James Cameron is probably the most bold and visionary director we could have seen in our lifetime. He created a human cyborg covered with tissue and skin in the Terminator franchise (1984) followed by a stunning sequel in 1991 which again was ahead of its time owing to its jaw-dropping CGI. He went deep sea-diving with The Abyss (1989) followed by hardcore action flick, True Lies (1994) and took us back to the most unfortunate incident told beautifully in Titanic (1997). With Avatar (2009), he created a gorgeous world of Pandora which was very well received even though the story was just fine. Similarly, the sequel has all the film-making style of Cameron which boast off quality work and you will be able to view in each and every frame of Avatar : The Way Of Water.Overall, James Cameron does justice to his fans and audience who waited for 13 years to witness the sequel which is grandeur and better than the first one. Do watch it in theaters to enjoy the experience.Ketan Gupta.Follow me on Filmychowk in Instagram."
"Never Doubt James Cameron. In the two decades that I've known of the Oscar-winning part-time filmmaker, part-time ocean explorer, I never have. But after Avatar: The Way of Water, it may be time to start. For my whole life, and for a few years before that, a new James Cameron film meant something very big. It meant a gigantic swing, a leap forward for special effects, a big deal. And now, after yet another decade-plus absence, Big Swingin' Jim has stepped back up to the plate and laid down a line drive single. Avatar: The Way of Water may be an amazing theme park thrill ride, but for the most precious filmmaker of this generation, that's not good enough.In other hands, a sequel of this sort would be a red flag. Set 15 years after Jake Sully's introduction to Pandora, The Way of Water contrives a new conflict for Jake and his blended Na'vi family to deal with. The humans, defeated in battle at the end of Avatar, return to Pandora to resume their very mean, very dumb mission of exploitation (always remember: humans are mean and dumb). A certain resurrected Colonel is after Jake and his family, and there are talking whales that complicate things. That is the extent of the plot in James Cameron's latest go at a movie sequel. But I trust Jim. Cameron is not only experienced with sequels, he is the greatest sequel-maker of all-time. He's a storyteller with the instincts to sniff out that divine piece of inspiration that separates a sequel from its original and gives it reason to exist. Aliens took Ridley Scott's humble sci-fi horror movie and blew it wide open into a full-fledged action spectacular. Terminator 2 retrofitted the iconic villain of his first movie into a hero, and so transformed a dingy, low-budget action film into a blockbuster of epic scope and importance.The Way of Water is not like these all-time great sequels. Avatar 2 is a sequel like Jaws 2 or Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a sequel. It's a piece of story that has been grafted onto Avatar, not its own entity nor a natural extension of the original. It's a gut punch to discover that we've waited over a decade for a new film from Jim Cameron, only to get a smaller, more perfunctory version of his last film. 'Perfunctory' is the last word I would ever use to describe the man sitting number two on my Favorite Directors list. But his latest, for all its technical ambition and physical scale, lacks the magic touch of a genuine ""Cameron Event"". It feels small. The stakes have been lowered to a few characters, the majesty has been contained to one new setting, and all the action and emotions just don't mean as much.I feared as much when Cameron announced his desire for 4 Avatar sequels. We saw Pandora already, and we had ourselves a full dramatic arc while we were there. 2009's Avatar is itself a complete epic. A singular cinematic achievement with a beginning, middle, and end. I put my trust in the man to justify going back there, but what he's given us here is a movie equal to Avatar in all technical departments-the action is huge, varied, uniformly outstanding, the special effects are awesome, even the writing, in the big scenes at least, matches the work done before-only, in the end, much less significant.Jim Cameron directs Avatar: The Way of Water on autopilot. That is to say, he wipes the floor with every other would-be action director working. From old-fashioned shootouts to creature attacks to multi-level sea battles and even an extended whale hunt, the action set-pieces of Avatar are always stunning. And forget action. There are plenty more set-pieces in The Way of Water that exist to showcase the underwater world Cameron loves so much, and the visual effects used to bring it to life. None of Avatar 2 looks, sounds, or moves ""boring"". Even at his most apathetic, Cameron delivers one of the great visual-aural thrill rides of the last decade. It's like a 4D theme park attraction, meant to give you a sense that you're out there swimming and flying, and breathing in the alien sea air. In that sense, the movie is awesome. It's a 3-hour version of a Disney World ride, only better, and for a fraction of the price. I whole-heartily recommend seeing it in 3D, despite the headache it gave me. Because Avatar: The Way of Water does do its predecessor's job of immersing one in a fictional world. Just don't expect that immersion to carry the same majesty or power as it did before.Cameron poured his soul into the first Avatar. For better or worse, it represented the ultimate distillation of all his passions. It turns out, as I thought, there was nowhere to go from there. With The Way of Water, he's clearly reaching for something to get excited about. The bio-spiritual, tree-hugging environmentalism is simply recycled from the last movie, and there are many attempts at familial themes, but it's obvious that Cameron's heart is not in this. Not like it was during the 30-year stretch of his career where each successive film grew in size, scope, and dramatic power, until James Cameron became his own force of nature. He's always been a bold filmmaker, with a tendency to overestimate how excited his audience would be for his idealistic working-class hippy philosophy. But he's always made up for goofy characters and dumb dialogue with huge high-concept ideas, super-muscular action and special effects filmmaking, and vigorous story structure. We're blessed to be given anything from Jim Cameron, but when we wait 13 years between films, we expect more than your typical (if extraordinarily thrilling) blockbuster sequel. It's unfair, but it's part of the deal when you are the King of the World.75/100."
"Perfect mix of serious and sweet. Glorious visuals with a sweet heartwarming story. I dont think it's an exaggeration when I say it's the best visual effects I have ever seen in my life. The movie is so simple yet extremely fabulous. Its a chill movie that serves as a plot opener to what to come in future installment and honestly I cant wait!!!Spoilers ahead
You have been warnedI really loved the family dynamics and Jake's and netyiri's character developments into parents. I would have liked to see more of them during the movie but I understand that the movie introduced a lot of new characters that needed to be built."
"Avatar 2 offers a visually stunning experience but falls short in terms of story and character development. The film introduces a lot of new characters, the kids, the new tribe, Kiri Sigourney Jesus, the daughter of Pandora but the characters as a whole are uninteresting and the story is trope-filled and predictable. The first film had a certain magic that is absent in this sequel. The first two hours of the movie are slow-paced and unengaging but things pick up in the last hour. Some of the events in the story make little sense and feel forced. The use of ""bro cuzz"" talk is completely out of place and detracts from the film. Despite these shortcomings, i give it 5 stars, 3 for the movie's visuals, 1 for the alien whale hero and another for the thrilling final fight. However, the movie overall fails to live up to the standard set by the first Avatar film."
"I saw this movie Christmas day in 3-D, after thirteen years of rewatching Avatar, daydreaming of the sequel, binge reading Avatar fanfiction, and coming up with theories. It was everything I could ever ask for. Cute kids, BEAUTIFUL visuals, and emotional scenes, one from Zoe Saldana that gave me goosebumps. I admit the script could be stronger, and the villain could be different, and the humans and Na'vi could be fleshed a tad bit more, but I came away from the theater feeling satisfied, like I just got off of a really good rollercoaster. I still think about the movie maybe hours after watching it, just contemplating how simple it is for humans to have their own Pandora on Earth, we have everything here. We are just polluting everything and mining poor Mother Earth to death. Chills from the Weekend's song on the credits and Neytiri's song. It's just as great as Leona Lewis' sendoff of the history making first film. It's worth the wait. Have an open mind and immerse yourself in the experience, learn the way of water. (:"
"It's incredible how clear images Cameron managed to create with this 3d. Although Avatar was more colorful and creative, the sequel has it's strength in the high-frame 3d scenes, with a quality I've never seen before!But the movie and storytelling itself is a big disappointment... The same speech of family staying together, with their kids doing stupid decisions during the ENTIRE movie, fighting against the bad guys (with no cohesive intentions), bla bla bla bla.... The movie feels like a preparation for next movie (which could be done with a cartoon series).The formula is the same, characters are almost the same, less creative than the first one, all the Hollywood clichés... I can't say this is a good movie, unfortunately, and I'll probably never watch it again!"
"So much has changed since the 2009 film Avatar became a worldwide sensation to moviegoers everywhere. James Cameron proved that creativity cannot be rushed and the end result is in its sequel The Way of Water. With the skills of his tech crew and his direction, he has shown plenty more of what the planet of Pandora has up its sleeve.More than a decade has passed since Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) fought against a human invasion that he once sided with and has transferred his mind permanently into the body of his avatar to become a full-fledged Na'vi to be with his love Neytiri (Zoe Saldana). Eventually, he settled down with her and raised a family. However, it is then he learns that the last human colony that was expelled from Pandora have returned with a new group of military along with an old foe he once defeated. Therefore, Jake brings himself to flee with his family from the Omaticaya tribe and move to another tribe known as the Metkayina near the waters of Pandora.Kate Winslet reunites with James Cameron since Titanic which is ironic since her character Ronal in this movie is a skilled free-diver compared to her previous character Rose who feared drowning and sinking in water. Likewise, the newcomers who portray Jake and Neytiri's children and adoptive kids are all unique and stand out well. Anyway, it's good to also see the return of other past cast members like Dileep Rao as Dr. Max Patel and Joel David Moore as Dr. Norm Spellman back along for the ride. Sadly, it would mark the first Avatar film without original composer James Horner. Glad they honored his memory by playing his original orchestral track of ""I See You"" for this sequel. Makes it feel more tranquil in the most calming scenes.I can understand why it took so long for Mr. Cameron to assemble this movie as the tech he was looking for to bring this visual setting to life couldn't be perfected well enough to his liking. Motion capture has become an integral part of this movie's production and I have to say it pays off by bringing this tech underwater. With a runtime of 192 minutes (which tops the original's 162 minutes), I didn't even take notice of how lengthy it was. I was too focused on the new setting and new addition of characters that became part of the story, specifically newcomer Jack Champion as Spider. He sure stood out as an honorary Na'vi who is actually human, but learned to adapt and bond alongside them. The climactic ending seems to also pay homage to Titanic as well. Granted, the film's story is not at very high standards compared to Cameron's past hits. However, I liked what I saw overall. With all its epic war sequences, gripping moments, dubious intentions, and conflicts amongst clans and allies. I was on the edge of my seat clutching onto the armrests completely satisfied. Like the first film, the environmental message about respecting the ecosystem was also there. Worth the ticket.The moral: With arduous efforts and great sacrifice, there shall be a just reward."
"First things first, they could have edited out at least an hour and 30 minutes. I went to the bathroom twice and did not miss anything important. They CGI is good, however it's not good enough to see a difference in quality compared to the original. If you have 3.5 hours to waste and nothing else to do, then it will fill that gap. As far as the excitement is concerned, you will need to wait almost 2.75 hours till they get to anything that resembles it. Absolutely not worth a 12 year wait. As a fan of almost all things sci-fi, fantasy and comic book, this is no where near my top 25 list of movies in that genre by a mile in almost all categories except number of blue people in the movie. Falls short of infinity war and end game by a mile. And the cgi in Infinity war and Endgame were better too. Temper your expectations and get comfortable."
"I had been waiting for this day for the last few years, ever since I came to know that Mr. Stickler James Cameron was mulling over the idea of a sequel to his magnum opus Avatar. Every year followed had full of buzzes that Avatar 2 was going to be released soon. In fact, Cameron delayed the release at least seven straight times. Maybe that was a trick to make the audience waiting, a clever tool to mint money. But Cameron is definitely not a businessman. The man who has given us gems for the last four decades has literally achieved everything any creative individual would like to have in his kitty. The famous Terminator franchise ( only the first two had the touches of the master craftsman ), True Lies, Titanic, Avatar - he has seen success like none else has ever dreamt of. Be it the box office or the awards show, Cameron has been the cynosure always. Very few people are aware of one of his earlier creations Abyss which made me love the heart behind every Cameron movie. In a nutshell, expectations from Avatar- The Way of Water was sky high in the truest sense.Has Cameron been able to satiate my appetite? I would say, partially. This new Avatar version has everything, from brilliant graphics, unreal action scenes to mesmerizing depiction of a world where we all want to be deported in our wild dreams. Hang on, it is not the end of it. Avatar 2 misses the points where its predecessor had scored from aces. After coming out of the theatre, I must admit that I had moments when I was yawning. I seriously expected so much from Cameron. And may be that expectation is the only thing I am not able to give it a perfect 10 or even 9 or 8. Avatar was created when the term VFX was unheard of. Avatar was an ethereal experience where you became one of the members in Pandora. Unfortunately, the sequel tries too hard to match the quality of its predecessor with so much improved VFX and CGI. But sadly enough, it fails to strike the cords the way that epic did exactly thirteen years back.The ever lovable Jake Sully and Neytiri have now a family and with the desire to protect his family from the wrath of the earthly beings, Sully takes them to an island. How the theme unfolds and whether he is able to protect his family forms the central plot of it. Was I the only one who missed Pandora? Pun intended.There are moments of brilliance in this movie. There are scenes which are going to give you real goosebumps. But those are not perpetual like the original Avatar and you really don't miss the world as you had done after coming out from the theater after watching Avatar thirteen years back. With a runtime of 192 minutes, Avatar 2 at some points make you think, why on earth did Cameron spend so many years for such a poorly edited movie. Had it been crispier, it would have surely left more lasting impressions. But Cameron was so much busy with his penchant for showing the world that he cares for the environment, he missed the moot, the story.Overall, Avatar sequel is an ordinary action film with loads of scenes with unbelievable visual brilliance. But that alone does not make you fall in love with the characters instantaneously as its predecessor did. The character building is pathetic to say the least and apart from the imaginary marine creatures, you really don't feel for any of the characters.Even Spielberg or Nolan had some off days. Cameron would like to forget the memories of Avatar 2 and I am sure an ace creator like him would surely understand his folly and make us enthralled again with the sequel of the Way of Water. Till then he is not the King of the World. Did I miss the point that this movie has so many memories of Titanic ? But Rose even though being present in the cast could not spell a cast like the 1911 tragedy Titanic. If you miss this in the theatres, you are not a fool. But if you do, you are certainly wise in saving money.My rating 6.5 out of 10."
"Visually, this is a masterpiece and maybe has the greatest CGI in motion picture history. It's stunning to look at and needs to be seen on the big screen. The technological advancements that Cameron has made to the medium of film, cannot be denied.Story wise, it's not quite as tight as the first film, but it's certainly not bad. The philosophical and environmental themes and motifs are still presented strongly. I do question the validity of this story arcing over 5 films, though. Perhaps it will be a generational thing and cover a large expanse of time, ala the Dune books. I guess that remains to be seen.Overall, a very entertaining watch and one I would recommend if you enjoyed the first film."
"The long-awaited sequel to Avatar, Avatar: The Way of Water, showcases its beauty with vivid scenes of pandora, including exposing Avatar fans to a new environment. Watching this movie in 3d added to the experience as the plot's pacing was effective enough to avoid boredom, especially with the film being over 3 hours long. The subordinate characters and side quests add to the movie's overall appeal. I wonder how different of an effect the plot had compared to the first installment.The paradise:
Avatar: The Way of Water is beautiful; the design, the characters, the creatures, the fighting scenes, the colors, and the motion, it is very appealing to the eyes. So much so that when you watch a movie, your mind sometimes wonders and thinks about other things. That is not the case here. Well, I was so focused that my mind didn't wonder what was going on; there wasn't a dull moment with the amount of character drama. Jake Sully fully embraces his new life with his wife getting busy and having fourth children, all of which have unique personalities. The youngest son is trying to prove himself and seems to be in trouble no matter what he does. The eldest son is the golden child yet takes up for his younger brother's mistakes. The youngest daughter doesn't seem to be afraid of anything, and the eldest daughter is ""adopted,"" so many answered questions there, and their unofficial child is named ""spider,"" who is human. With the various characters and relationships, the film provides plenty of opportunity for emotional scenes. Featuring neglect, wanting to fit in, and tough sacrifices.The not-so-paradise:
Because this movie is so long, it seems necessary to have various issues simultaneously to avoid repetitiveness and dull moments, yet this also serves as a fault. Because there is so much going on and the film looks beautiful, I needed to hone into the main theme/plot. The plot follows Jake sully migrating his family out of the forest to the Water Na'vi to protect them from the human hunters. This introduction to new species makes me wonder how many variations of Na'vi there are. Compared to the film's other elements, the plot was executed only after being fair. It wasn't overwhelmingly impressive. It's like going to a restaurant, and the waiter brings you a sizzling dish; all eyes are on the presentation, yet the dish's taste doesn't match the display. The plot is similar to the first Avatar with one of the same antagonists.Verdict:
Regardless this is an enjoyable sequel probably even more embraced by die-hard Avatar fans. I didn't expect the same magic. Avatar: The Way of Water separates itself by establishing the necessary variety to the world of Pandora. I am afraid of the potential of a repetitive storyline for future productions. Is it worth the watch? Yes, especially in theaters with some 3D and maybe even D-box features if accessible. I'm still determining if I'll watch it again, but I enjoyed the movie. More reviews on Instagram @entertainmentsparadise."
"Avatar2 definitely won't disappoint anyone on graphics and being creative with creating an alternate reality within the sea ...Yet, Avatar 2 may find a tougher challenge to match with Avatar 1 on a few fronts -1). Strong engaging story
2). Length of the movie
3). Gap in time of releasesBeing a fan of sci fi and thriller movies, Avatar 1 caught my interest for it's ability to not just create a new world Pandora but also an engaging yet crisp story telling about humans , their need for Pandora and the natives. Best in class team to work on Graphics made the story more so real that we all wanted to watch Avatar2.But having waited for almost a decade, I think the A2 has to be more interesting than its predecessor on all fronts mentioned above. Story, engaging yet crisp and graphics.While graphics didn't disappoint, the movie for me fell flat on all other parameters.Movie came across as a revenge party between the villain and protagonist than anything else. While it isn't a bad plot, a decade wait for this story line didn't justify for me.It's stretched in story telling in A2, with rushed up scenes to cover gaps in later part of the movie to make meaning of climax and didn't help. There was a few moments during later 1 hour of the movie where I just wanted the movie to end.To conclude, am sure there's enormous effort that has gone into the movie and kudos to the team, it's just that I believe I am not as excited after watching A2 as I was A1 and have no plans to watch upcoming ones.This movie will definitely garner support and box office for marketing and audience that will love graphics but that isn't the barometer of a good movie!"
"What have I just watched? I'm not sure if it was the cinema where we watched Avatar 2, but the screen was far too dark with 3D glasses on and the quality was really grainy. It was almost like watching a cheap pirated version on VHS in 1982. The sound was just loud... No surround sound, just the volume cranked up to maximum.The storyline is weak and the plot is definitely aimed at very young children, which I suppose you'd expect from a Disney film. Basically, the story is just the original Avatar but with water! Jake Sully has somehow managed to raise a bunch of spoilt, entitled little brats. James Cameron has decided to spend most of the film showing off his animation rather than developing a brand new plot. It just felt as though we had to endure 50% of the time watching James Cameron give himself a pat on the back for doing such a good job with the effects... it felt narcissistic to say the least. Having said that, the animation is extremely good, but when animation gets that good and almost indistinguishable from real life, then there's nothing to show off any more. Your eyes just believe what they're seeing and it loses the wow factor. Great animation alone is NOT enough. You need a decent story too.I wouldn't recommend anyone go to see this at the cinema. If you want to see it, wait until it comes out on Disney later this year. The 3D just isn't necessary and if you're watching it at home at least you can press pause for a toilet break! For the cost of one visit to the cinema plus food and drink, you could have a subscription to Disney plus for a year!!!We left the cinema half way through the showing which is something I've never done before. It didn't help that the cinema was too cold and the entire viewing experience was so poor, but if Avatar 2 had really been good enough we might have put up with the discomfort to find out how the Sullys got on fighting the bad guys. However, in the end, we just didn't care about any of the characters and all we could think about was finding the nearest toilet and getting in the car to warm up.I really wanted to like Avatar 2 but this was disappointing to say the least. The film is too long for children or anyone with a small or weak bladder and the plot is too simplistic for anyone over 10 years old. 12 years to come up with this sequel... Speechless."
"This is not really a film. It has no shape, no thematic magic. There's no intellectual or emotional structure to connect to. It's just a series of visually vibrant scenes.There's barely a story. The characters are one dimensional and the dialogue is bland. The main character is as interesting as a coat hanger. The visuals, while technically impressive, are limited in their substance and highly repetitive.Compare this to, say, Harry Potter 2. The story was multilayered and compelling. The characters were lovable and emotionally engaging. The visuals were artistically beautiful and infused with meaning.Avatar 2 is a big, meaningless, dumb, blue blur. I kept the faith for James Cameron for all these years, but he didn't even bother to nail the most important aspect of a film: the SCRIPT!Given the success of the original Avatar, writing an excellent script (even if it meant hiring others) should have been priority number 1. All this talk about pushing the limits of CGI and camera technology, underwater filming etc... Totally worthless if the story and characters are bland.Sigourney Weaver's young character with a mysterious connection to the planet was the only point of interest. But that wasn't explored with any intention. She could have been the main character, and the story all about her going deeper and uncovering Pandora's many and varied secrets. Maybe it's not really a planet. Maybe an old foe is returning from a distant part of space. Something different. Instead, we get a rehash of natives and soldiers gritting their teeth at each other for 3 hours."
"We would live in a better world with those living more satisfied lives instead of being controlled by the narratives outside of our control. If this movie didn't inspire you to change something about yourself for the better, the movie isn't the problem, you are.For me, the very process this film came about inspires me to pursue excellence in my own life. There is no comparison to make to any other films in terms of visuals because this films is in its own class. If it feels like NatGeo, that should actually be a compliment for the film crew who worked on it for years to make it as convincing as possible.For the story, I could relate to the characters and be immersed in their motives without difficulty, which I assume is what Cameron wanted.If you are rating this movie anything below 8 due to storyline, is like criticizing a two-fingered pianist play a classical piece by Chopin and call her ""unoriginal"" for playing a dead musician's music. Actually, no. It's like criticizing the pianist for playing her own composition and criticize her for playing a piece that ""sounds"" like Chopin.Just know if you don't like this movie, there is something truly empty in your life that you cannot recognize excellence when you see it."
"The storyline was extremely shallow and predictable (actually there wasn't even any real story to be honest). The dialogues were so empty they sounded like they had been written by a teenager. All of the characters were one dimensional and acted in ways that would make you feel so frustrated you couldn't help but roll your eyes. The only good thing about this film was the visual effects, but even that got old/boring after a while, because as pretty as everything looked, there was no element of novelty or surprise. And 3 hours was way too long considering there was zero development in the story or the characters.I watched this in IMAX 3D and felt like it was a waste of time and money. There were several parts where I almost fell asleep."
"Great characters, emotion, and the artistry of the environments and creatures is unlike anything else out there. Personally the length didn't bother me, and while there are some retcons, they are in aid of the story and upcoming sequels.The HFR was a bit of a mystery, considering it seemed to be almost arbitrarily applied to shots - I would have preferred the whole thing to be in 48 fps.Sad to see people wanting to hate this film because of Cameron's political views or his success. Guy is a legend who has created some of the best films of all time - you trying to drag him down says a lot more about you than it does about him."
"Saw this a couple of nights ago with my other half & our 2 young boys (10 & 7). Our youngest fell asleep about 2/3 of the way in (3hrs was a bit too long for him) & our 10yo barely made it all the way to the end but he did just manage it.We saw it in 3D, which was definitely worth doing, I reckon. There are some really nice jungle & under water shots that are made even more amazing by the 3D treatment. Some nice action scenes, too. It did seem like they'd forgotten to apply the 3D effect to the occasional shot here & there but, overall, it was very, very good.Our kids loved it & we were initially concerned the 3D might bother them, hurt their eyes or give them a headache or something, but neither of them had any issues with it.There's a lot going on in the film & I won't spoil it for anyone but it's the sort of movie that I reckon could easily be watched a handful of times for fans of the genre as it just has so many different ""sections"" to it; the kind that, for me, make movies like Aliens & Thor: Ragnarok so rewatchable. And James Cameron's attention to detail & adding certain scenes (like when the humans are going through the motions of loading their boats onto ramps & into the water) that other directors are unlikely to have bothered with, really add to feeling that he really spared no expense with putting his vision together. My other half disagrees with me on this point & reckoned a lot of that ""fluff"" could've been trimmed out to shorten the runtime. I guess you can't please everyone...The CG effects are top notch, of course, & the story isn't half-bad, either, so go & give it a watch... but ensure you get plenty of rest the night before as it is quite long; especially for the kidlets!"
"It was such a great experience, the CGI was stunning. Honestly the plot wasn't even terrible, there were some flaws but overall it worked well imo. This movie felt more like a bridge to the third movie and acted mainly as a device to build and expand Pandora rather than telling a brand new story. The themes were well explored, touching on topics like animism and gnosticism while reflecting real world environmental issues human had created on Earth. His fascination and adoration for nature and spiritual connections are just so beautifully portrayed, we all came from the ocean and our soul will eventually return to it after our death."
"Scorsese was right. Movies like this are not ""cinema"", exactly. It's something else. When you can buy tickets for seats that move with the action, it's something else. (like imagine an interactive novel, with surround sound ambient sound effects and piped in scents, to match what you read...it's no longer just literature, it's something else).This is more of a ride and a sensory experience than cinema. In 3D, This feels more like a long DisneyWorld attraction than a movie. The frame rate changes are distracting. Alternating from smooth ""soap opera"" high def video to occasionally looking actually filmic and realistic.Unlike, say, The seventh seal or the godfather, The story and characters here could be adequately summarized in a sentence or two, with little to no finer resolution required. One could make the same argument for the first Star Wars, i suppose.But telling a simple story in an epic way doesn't necessarily diminish the piece. Or does it? In this case the story and characters are not so much archetypes (as in Star Wars) as they are just SO thin and shallow as to be perfunctory, generic and ultimately devoid of what is necessary to be compelling: relatability.Star Wars was thin, to be sure, but the archetypes and story were so classic, and so universal as to be somehow relatable and human, in a way that Avatar isn't.This is a ride, with or without the moving seats. And though it is certainly worth the price of admission, it's lasting effect is precisely as long and deep as the feeling one is left with exiting a disney attraction. It's fun while it lasts, then it all but evaporates as you get in line for the next ride."
"Took a very long to get absolutely nowhere. This Gil. Could have achieved the same result in 90 minutes and not almost given me a bladder infection.Visually beautiful and the flora and fauna design again are amazing but it doesn't distract from the fact that this film suffers under the weight of its own bloat.The first avatar was a good remake of ""Dances with Wolves"" and as such had a good storyline to follow. The problem with this new film is it has no direction or character development to drive it and does little to hide the gaping plot holes that are littered through this film.I won't pay money to see another Avatar film."
"Unpopular opinion, but this was easily the worst James Cameron movie in recent memory for me😂
A pretty animation and a visual spectacle for sure, but unbelievably bloated and littered with questionable choices...
To enjoy this movie would require that one throws all logic out the window, and despite such a long runtime, a coherent plot and character development are still virtually nonexistent.When all is said and done, this was +3 hours of my life that I will never get back.On a more positive note, once this comes out on DVD, I'd definitely recommend playing it in the background of a house party. Just drink every time one of the kids say ""bro"", and you're gonna have a lot of fun (before passing out drunk by the time the movie is over !) You're welcome 😁"
"I liked the first movie ok, watched it recently and the the SFX are better than any movie released every year since up until today. I was disappointed by the story in the first film and it's similarities to past films (Pocahontas, Dances with wolves, etc). I never seen a memorable sequel to a story like that. Mr Cameron is responsible for 2 of the 3 best sequels ever made (Aliens and T2, GF2 being the third). If anyone can pulls off a sequel to a familiar story and make it unique and awe inspiring, it's Jim. And he did.Avatar the way of water is a superior film in every way. Right off the bat the effects are superior to the already superior 13 yr old effects from the first. 9 or 10 times during the film I muttered to myself, "" how the hell did they do this?"" A wonderful feeling I haven't felt since Jurassic Park in 1993. I couldn't tell what was real or fake. Just incredible. The motion capture performances are captured so convincingly that I thought I was looking at actors in high quality make-up. Zoe Saldana is a gifted mo-cap actor. A true stand out. This film made the effects in contemporary Marvel or Star Wars movies look silly, amateurish and glaringly inferior.The story is fast paced and engrossing. Three hours felt like an hour and a half. Some similar beats to the first one but an entirely new story. Amazing film."
"I'm someone who watched the first Avatar movie like a 100 times since its release, and every time it re-released, I was there first day first show just to experience in on the big screen again. Hell, I've even re-watched it twice in the last one week. I've been a great admirer of James Cameron's works, but sadly, this movie was a huge let down in terms of story. I understand the first one didn't have a great story, but it was well told with gorgeous visuals to support it. Unfortunately, visuals is all there is with The Way Of Water(TWOW).As a VFX enthusiast, this is the kind of movie every artist dreams to work on, myself included. The visuals on the IMAX screen was such a beautiful experience. I've never seen anything done in this way with such impeccable attention to details. Like James Cameron said in an interview, you can literally read the characters' face and understand what's going in there head, it is that well made. The creature designs, the landscapes, the particle simulations are so realistic that it becomes indistinguishable from real life. We get almost an hour-long experience of Na'vi exploring the sea world and interacting with its creatures and I loved every bit of it.Despite being a 3+ hour movie, the story had pacing issues and felt mostly lacking. It starts with Jake narrating the last few years, which is basically everyone is just having kids and somehow they all end up under the care of Jake and Neytiri. They brought back Quaritch and few other soldier from the last movie as Avatars quite conveniently. But hey, I didn't mind it at all, it worked for me. Every scene with Quaritch was a joy because of how good of an actor Stephen Lang is, he is intimidating and ruthless. From there on, the plot revolves around Jake's kids doing stupid stuffs which gets them into trouble and hurt themselves over and over again. This happened multiple times and they get caught by Quaritch multiple times too. The plot just didn't go anywhere.When the final battle started, there were so many Na'vi but after like 5 minutes into it, everyone seems to disappear, like what tf? The entire last 30-45 minutes battle is just the Sully family against Quaritch and his team, it felt like such a big oversight on the Cameron.It was also really hard for me to comprehend that once the Sully family left the forest, they just never acknowledged them again. Their main-objective was to kill Jake, sure, but they also wanted the Unobtanium, right? They said that's what paid for the whole operation in the first movie, but here they introduced another element which again, it supposedly paying for the whole operation? Its like they're recycling the plot points, since James Cameron is an ocean activist, is this what he intended? Recycling? Seems funny to me.The one new character I liked very much was Kiri, which is played by the amazing Sigourney Weaver. She has a special bond with Eywa and looks like she can control some the beings around her. They showed it a couple of times and I was very intrigued and well invested in her plot. They showed it a couple of times but not enough for me. Hopefully, we get to see more in the next one.There are a few good and emotional scenes which I think worked well and did provide a sense of both tension and grief. There is a Tulkun (Pandora's whale) hunting sequence which I believe is a representation of real-life hunting. It was extremely heart breaking.Overall, the movie it a great visual spectacle. If you were, just like me, mesmerized with Pandora from the last movie, there is a high chance love it ever more in this one."
"Like many, I went in to this with high expectations, given how wonderful the first movie was and that the bar had been set pretty high. I'll keep it short and sweet to avoid giving any sort of spoiler, but in my opinion it was breathtaking. The storyline, the scenery/CGI, the characters (both old and new) everything gelled. The themes are so pertinent and relevant to our current world issues/challenges, perhaps that's why it packs the emotional punch that it does. I'm so glad that they took their time with this, it just shows how amazing cinema can be if you don't rush it, so much stuff is just rushed through now so that studios can cash in. Another testament to how good this movie is is that my wife didn't glance at her phone once for the whole three hours."
"First of all, the visuals in this movie are nothing but stunning, as we predicted. In some scenes the CGI isn't as clean but that's acceptable when runtime surpasses the 180 minute mark. I was astonished by some underwater shots and Pandora's nature environment in it's entirety. In that category the movie can easily keep up with it's predecessor or even surpass our expectations.Now for the less remarkable part: The story.Despite offering a quite relatable start and a somewhat promising introduction story, the movie rapidly changes into a cheap good vs bad sci- fi- fantasy tale. There is 0 depth and every possible opportunity to create originality was wasted.Also Character development and emotional story throughout the film are completely blatant, with only a few scenes being unpredictable.At certain points the viewer is left with questions over questions, as to why certain things have to be written the way they are. For example: Why does the main villain need to learn language and culture (he seemingly even needed a banshee dragon) of the population, to do nothing other than attacking them?Last thing I want to criticize is the massive overlength. Of course a movie with lots of non -dialogue sequences and such 'nature display' sucks up time, but 3 hours was just over the top and unjustified, since nothing much happened.If you are a big fan of Cameron's pictures, colors and overall world he creates, then this might be enough to satisfy you, but don't expect a masterpiece.I am not a fan and to me the movie was a big disappointment."
"The most loud and common reaction I heard as I was leaving the cinema auditorium from fellow viewers was: ""wow this didn't feel so long, in fact it was almost quick"". Considering the fact that this movie is by no means quick it's a big testimony to how riveting and captivating the movie was. Plot and visuals combined. And I'm saying at the very beginning of my review - I won't be discussing the visuals - I simply can't add a thing to what's been said already.The points I want to make regard the plot, which is much better than other reviewers claim. And the characters. I heard a few say that this movie is very much like the first installment, most of the people saying that spoke about it as a fault - it's not. It's simply the outcome of a single story being continued from the first installment. Think of it as another chapter you read in a book, you don't expect every chapter to turn the story upside-down, in fact you'd be complaining if that would be the case. Thing is, Cameron has already done that with his installments of Terminator (I & II), once you see the two you realize it was a single movie separated into two chapters. That's the reason Cameron didn't want anything to do with the 3rd installment of Terminator - it went against the point his story was making: We make our own destiny and we're strong enough to do it. I don't know yet what's his point this time - I'm not sure if we've seen the end of this story. But I'm definitely going to wait and watch the next installments. He did create an amazing complete world in his mind, and I always love it when an artist creates an entire world for his story.As for the characters created in this movie, unlike the first one no significant character is left undeveloped. Some could use more substance but obviously the movie would end being even longer. Accordingly, the acting was first class. Though I'm still uncertain regarding the fact Sigourney Weaver is playing her 14 years old daughter. I understand the point Cameron is making, and she does it flawlessly but I'm still a bit uneasy about it. The only thing I have against this movie is some things Cameron has left out of his story or spoke too little about. It's not a major issue, and as I already said - the movie was long enough as is, but still a few details are missing for the story to be completely coherent."
"When I watched Avatar in IMAX years ago, I was thoroughly moved by the imagery, the world, the characters, and the story. What facilitated that emotion was a blind approach where I went into the movie with no real idea about it. I took a similar approach to this movie too.I was dazzled by what True IMAX could bring to life. The visual brilliance of this movie brought out the world and the characters to life, but the story lacked depth.It mostly contained a lot of platitudes about family, about the way of water, and a whole lot of action with no meaningful underlying message. It was just about eat or be eaten. At certain points, it felt more like the Fast and the Furious series than it did of the wondrous landscape Pandora could have been.Visually stunning. Kudos to all the people that made it happen. Fire the writers twice for essentially dishing out a meaningless story that focused on platitudes and not at all on character formation, suspenseful twists, or anything that could have made the movie as good as the first one."
"Thank you for continuing with 3D movies and not abandoning it as is happening with 3D movies, where it takes the viewer to another marvelous field of vision, we hope that you continue to make progress in making 3D movies available for all audiences, like televisions, why not anymore? They want to make 4K and 8K with 3D where it's another world. The film has been made too long and too focused on his family, being able to cut a lot of footage, a great success in focusing on taking care of aquatic animals and the ecology where more and more is destroyed in this world because of bad world policy. Nature follows its course, it is already warning us with the snowfall of the poles."
"To start off this was ok. The visuals and special effects was nothing short of amazing. However, if you just cared about visuals, than stick to Natural Geographic. The story was pretty lame, what happens isn't really the problem, it's more so the script and the actual telling of the story. The whole first half of the movie was summarizing between the end of the first movie until this new story, which was insanely unnecessary.The way they did it, just wasn't very good, not saying the first movie was amazing but it was better told and had a better plot. Nothing really happened until just before the fighting started. With that being said, I could see how maybe this is the first part of a bigger story to come later, like one of those filler episodes in a TV series before the good part. But honestly like a filler episode, I will never want to rewatch it."
"Let's be honest. Avatar 1 was Dances With Wolves in Space. The visuals were amazing but the story was terrible and predictable. This isn't any better. Honestly how much.visual spectacle is nothing new in films today and the more you see.the less impact it has. The more you see towering jungles, underwater reefs.and floating mountains before my brain becomes numb.to the whole thing. If you are fed the same cake morning, noon and night you are always going to get sick of it eventually.The whole family angst and teen drama junk went on for 90 MINUTES!!!How has no one recalled the events from the first film? They completely destroyed the tree in the first one but no one seems to recall that.The cliche of humans vs Navii is just contrite and tired noble savage trope. As if we don't have enough tropes already in films and TV right now.James, you need to stop writing your films because you actually suck at writing. But the technical side is amazing so stick to that.As the Critical Drinker said:""I struggle to decide whether or not to recommend this film to people. If it had been an hour shorter and maybe a bit smarter and more nuanced it would have been a no-brainer for me but as it stands even though it's better than almost anything else put out by Disney this year it's so long, so bloated and so self-indulgent that I really don't know if it's worth your time and money and if the early box office results are anything to go by I might not be the only one."""
"I remember being completely entranced by the first Avatar. I've been a fan of every work that Cameron has released but he's so much more than a storyteller. He's an inventor. He's paved the way for so many movies and their effects and has set a standard that other Hollywood elite lately can never hope to meet. I'm so glad he finally was able to release the second movie, since as of now the movie industry is in crisis and we are consistently faced with mediocre work that is mostly bad sequels of original content. Once again - Cameron has worked miracles. The amount of detail and effort that was put into Avatar 2... it's mind blowing. I hear a lot of steam from whiners on the internet who blast it when they haven't even seen it. They are fools. Cameron doesn't just direct - he steers and puts his blood, sweat, and tears into every project. He's the greatest filmmaker to have ever lived. I truly hope we get more content from him over the years. I'm really looking forward to the sequels!And side note - I love how Sigourney Weaver (my favorite actress) was incorporated back into this movie. Fantastic."
"This is not AVATAR as one would think it to be! It's a three hour violent war film with whaling. The whaling scene was so unnecessary- harpooning a mother whale with its calf following it and once the whale was dead the calf is seen nudging its dead mother - the film was so distasteful, disturbing and ridiculous. The visual was stunning and that's about it. Avatar 3 has already been filmed and is set to be released in 2024 - if it's anything like 2 I sincerely hope that Cameron reconsiders it and tones it down and 3 and 4 need to be pulled. And why exactly did this take three years to make...???"
"The visuals are great and often times videogame-isque. Otherwise the story is shallow and childish.Can't wrap my head around how the important parts weren't given enough importance (yeah, just leave your forest tribe to save your ass or let's send someone from earth to chase a single guy in the space for no reason, etc.) and yet an hour spent in showing unnecessary visuals. The characters are boring and you don't feel any bonding to any of them. The dialogues are again childish and don't give a feeling of a good writing. It gets boring often times because of all these things.Another annoying part was that the HFR seemed coming and going and wasn't present in the whole movie which makes it difficult to get used to HFR or cinema fps.TBH it was a disappointment except for the nice visuals."
"Goodness me, even though I went to the movies without any expectation, but this was really bad, the first two and half hours were very boooooooooing, just silly none sense talk, then finally get the last 30 minutes of pure stupid action. There was no story to begin with, unless you want to consider the revenge as the main plot or story, basically, there was no point to the whole movie and it felt more like watching a soap opera but with blue people. Furthermore, every scene was so predicable. Silly dialogue, can't say much about acting, as the whole movie was visual affects. Even the actions scenes were silly and lame. Bottom line, don't waste neither your money, nor your time."
"As basic of a story line as I've seen in a while and with very little additions over the first movie. Just a standard (we are the miller's) American family with some blue face paint. Special effects were good but the movie lacked any creativity, I would not recommend watching this.It lacked the alien feel and exploration of a new world, new technology, new science that the first movie had. Not sure that the wait was needed, a better story with worse cgi etc would have been much better! Not everything needs a blockbuster budget to be a blockbuster. Hopefully they will not be making another in this ilk."
"I don't understand why people criticize anything so much. Take the example of story of the Avatar 2009 film. A man(Jake Sully) betrays his planet for save the people of Pandora from the people of his planet who are using Pandora for their own benefits. And now in Avatar 2 the story has taken a new turn it is shown in the movie that the people of earth have started making Pandora a new home.James Cameron make a Film, the most expensive and also most ambitious production to date.James Cameron made a complete replica of the Titanic ship in the Titanic movie. This is an example of how hard he work and also if the current film making technology does not match his vision, he creates his own technology.He developed performance capture photography when he was making the Avatar movie. And now with Avatar the way of water he done it once again. Now let's see what will be the story in the upcoming movies from Avatar 3."
"I wouldn't say the movie is disappointing but it didn't really meet my expectation yet. I won't say anything about the visual effect because I'm not the expert in this field as well as this is not the main factor in a good movie in my point of view. Avatar 1 has better plot i believe. Every details were well built without any excess informations, each character has their own charm. Sadly, I don't see that in Avatar 2. The only character that got the spark in Avatar 2 is Jake Sully but after choosing to hide to protect his family, that spark dimed out too. In Avatar 2 there are too much characters but without enough time to be dig well in each one. Consequently, I only found those kids super annoying, except Neteyam. However, this one looks very cringe to me, Idk why, maybe because of his acting, or there s no good interactions and chemistry with others. The most annoying one must be the Tarzan. He lives like a human spy who had introduced his father how to attack Pandora, and even show him how to become one. The only evil of the film gained 3x lives and that is too much for me while good people is so easy to be killed and died. The action scenes in the end could be shorter and cleaner if they dont just return mid way and decided to rescue more people. Thats another too much for me. At the end of the movie, i hardly say if that left something inside me, its just empty. 3 hours movie couldnt deliver any clear message. I think that this is a step back from the original one."
"I tried my best to keep a low expectation for this movie but james cameron really said ""keep it high"", This movie is actually much better from the og ( well i still love avatar). This time we can see how Jake have turned into a matured-caring father and try his best to keep his family safe. I love how we can see the resemblance from avatar. AND OF COURSE the cgi! It is so so fantastic especially the underwater scenes. I didn't take my eyes off from the screen because how mesmerizing is the scenery. In this 3 hour length, you can see a lot of fight scenes even though it's a small one. I don't know how to explain this, it's like there is no major-big-armies fight scene it just mostly between jake and the general. But the fight scene is very emotional you can see how jake is trying to save his family from sky people. Lastly, emotional scenes, when jake's first son ,neteyam died it is very sad, you can feel neytiri and jake love for their son. And also scene kiri and grace is also very sad. I've been waiting for this movie and it didnt crush my expectation i will give it 9.5/10 overall but for the cgi? 1000/10."
"After seeing the first trailers, it seemed more of the first movie. I don't mind the 3 hours and 12 minutes at all, if you love movies, the more the better, if it's a good movie.This one starts off fast and furious, with a few amazing twists I didn't see coming. But also repetitive with the same story line, JAKE SULLY must be destroyed.The visuals are stunning, but towards the middle of the movie, it gets very slow, as JAKES family(they now have 4 children), move away to the water tribe of their people to escape them being hunted and killed. There is a whole story with a whale like creature in the ocean that went on wayyyyyyyy to long. I actually found myself wanting to see the villain more, and he seemed to take a backseat to the SULLY kids repeatedly. Also ""THE COMPANY"", prevalent in the first movie, and crucial, is almost non existent in this movie, nor their threat.The story telling takes a back seat to the visuals, and that's a shame. Much like the first movie, CAMERON spends way too much time with JAKE SULLY and not enough with QUARITCH, and his hired military thugs. The character development is poor at best, and you know nothing about his team, so, of course, you don't care about them at all. Also, at the beginning, QUARITCH is seeking the stronghold of JAKE, but it is never revisited. I kept waiting for QUARITCH to attack and destroy the tree people, but it's never shown. Did he ever find the stronghold? Did they wipe out JAKES people? They never show the tree people ever again. WHAT?!!The whole water scenes take way to long and then when they show QUARITCH he's tracking a ship that went to the islands. What? So are all the tree people dead? Did you find the stronghold? Just didn't make sense to me, like a part of the movie was just cut out.The 4 SULLY children actually have the most screen time, and after a while, you start saying to yourself over and over, ""Do these kids ever listen to their parents?"" And, ""Oh, big surprise, there go JAKES kids again, running off again to be captured by the bad guys, and to be used for bait, AGAIN!"" Which lead to the movie being very predictable. Because every time the kids ran off and didn't listen, they ran right into the bad guys, who captured them yet again. Weirdly enough, JAKE and NEYTIRI aren't really in the movie a whole lot, and when they are, it's running after their misbehaving kids and bailing them out over and over. I kept thinking, why didn't they just name this movie ""AVATAR:THE WAY OF JAKES KIDS"", or ""AVATAR:THE WAY OF QUARITCH"", because that is who you see the most, never a good balance of characters throughout.There are some great new characters, especially one named ""SPIDER"", who was my favorite, and some meaningful moments for those who have families, and those who don't, and how the old axiom, ""BLOOD IS THICKER THAN WATER"", truly still applies.The best part of the movie is the epic final battle, which lasts about 45 to an hour at the end of the movie. There are some scenes where I have no idea how they made it?In the end, if you loved the first movie, go see it. It is more of the same, a good movie, but not a great movie."
"I love Avatar 1. I watched it on my 18th birthday with proper 3D and i fell in love both with Na'avi and Pandora.I waited patiently for Avatar 2 and it finally came..First thing is: this movie is beautiful. Seriously. Even Avatar 1 can't compare! The way of the water is REALLY about the water. The name of this movie doesn't lie... I it's beautiful. It's James Camerons love letter to what he loves most I guess.The story however... that is... Uhhhh.. Repetition, that's how i'd describe it. Not even from Avatar 1, which also has plenty of similar, yet slightly changed, events. In Avatar 2 you'll get hit in the face with certain elements repeating over and over again. Because of that you can feel the lenght of this movie. And.. damn I'd love to love this movie but... it's just rose-tinted glass level of good, that might be degraded to just average later.Still, It's a crime to not check it in cinema. The visuals are... Amazing is underselling it, really.However I truly warn all of you guys: If you don't usually watch movies in HFR (high frame rate - alot of frames per second), then (!!!)DO NOT(!!!) pick that option while going to cinema. You'll feel like certain scenes are speed up, like you are watching them on 2x speed. It's nauseating. It definitely impacted negatively my experience while watching. I wonder what will we get for Avatar 3... if we ever get it."
"This has to be one of the most overrated and overhyped movies in the history of cinema. Let's start with the basics, the film has no plot and the little plot it has is really weak. Once again it is the absolutely evil humans against the good blue saints. We were also supposed to get excited about a different kind of blue people being introduced ''the water, lighter blue people''. Sorry but the introduction was weak and not interesting at all. It feels like we know nothing about this new tribe so what was the point of introducing them in the first place? The only difference I noticed was their color, everything else seemed to be pretty much the same. Also am I the only one who noticed that all of the bad people were white? Correct me if im wrong but all the (human) villains I remember were white.None of the characters have any depth. I was literally not interested in any of them. None of them had decent development and that's weird when you consider that this movie was more than 3 hours long. Instead of focusing so much on epic ocean scenes, they should have focused more on character development. The only character that seemed to have some decent development was the ''naughty'' son of Jake Suly and yes I don't even remember his name. I don't remember any names because all the characters were forgettable. The only character that I remember his name is Spider. What was this whole thing extracting the liquid from these whale-like creatures and sell it for 80 million dollars for people who want to remain young? Really only 80 million for what it sounds like immortality? That's so dumb.Why did they have to save the main villain in the end? Such a forgettable villain. Just let him die! Also if you delete half of the movie nobody would notice because most of the movie is just beautiful ocean scenes with no connection to the plot. I remember myself 3 times wanting to get out and leave the theatre. When the movie ended I felt so happy to be able to leave. So now you probably wonder if I have anything good to say about this film. Yes I have, the visual effects, animation and cinematography was great. Also some scenes were interesting but that's all, other than this movie is tasteless, boring, forgettable. Just skip, don't go to the cinema to watch it in my opinion, you will waste your money. My rating is 5.9/10."
"There are mane positives with this movie, the visual effects and the design, that is undeniable, but when you think deeper then there are many questions that really disturb me.The first movie was all about saving the environment and how the blue people were defending their world and how they live and respect it. This movie is all about the revenge of one of the marines against the protagonist, nobody cared about the world or the natural resources exploitation, it was like terminator, a bad guy chasing another one destroying everything on its way.The other thing is this fascination that Hollywood has with machine guns and bullets, this is the future right? So why on earth are the humans still using guns? Also, it is 2023 now, many countries are moving towards electric cars, but in this future the space ships are still exploding because they are full of gasoline? Wouldn't humanity found an alternative energy source by then?Finally, it looks like their focus was to create the products for the franchise, now is all underwater, so new toys can be released, what is next? The snow? I know they are planning 5 more movies, but I barely tolerated this one, 3 hours and half of the movie was about the kids learning to dive under water and live the recurrent American team of the bullying, don't they understand that the rest of the world do not bully and probably other planets neither? The other half was shootings and explosions. At the end nobody learnt anything and the society in there remained intact, while the USA government I guess on representation of earth, just spent billions of dollars trying to kill an exmarine ?The whole premise was just ridicule. And sorry but I won't get back these three hours of my life ..."
"Visually this AVATAR is next generation that CGI could achieve. The CGI is far beyond any movies or any games that can produced until this end of year (Disney or MCU should see this). James Cameron once again brings CGI to next level that i cant expected before and my eyes quite watery seeing a water could be this beautiful. Not mention jungle density and fire explosive for CGI like that is quite insane rendering CGI.Although the CGI itself is very insane and beautiful, but i see some flaw with too much blurry and quite bit gray-ish in some scene. If there is Blu-Ray version now, i would suggest using monitor over 140 Mhz and with HDR also with some Ray Tracing that would be maxed out the colors.The story quite simple and predictable in some scene, but this story is a bridge for another AVATAR 3. The story for AVATAR 2 is well connected to the old ones but the final touch about war with star people is not big as the old ones.The final word from me, you must see this beautiful CGI ever made until this day."
"If you are going to enjoy the grand vfx scenes and fights, then this is a great movie for you. There are lots of visual effects and fight sequences. However, if you are like me, and expect this to be a sequal to the legandary James Cameron's Avatar (2009), then you would be disappointed like me. The storyline has a lot of gaps which I didnt expect from JC after a wait of 13 years. Why colonel Miles Avatar was seeking revenge on Jake even before knowing that Miles is dead and how, is not clear. The fearless Toruk Macto - why he abandons Navis and runs away with family?Spyder is so loyal to Navi's that he doesn't even budge slighly when he's tortured in the thoughts reader. He doesnt even let a thought of Navi's hiding place in mind. And this so determined person teaches Miles and gang where to find Banshees? And helps them in their mission? Every character in the movie is confused with their motive. What is the motive for sky people? To avenge Jake Sully or hunt Tokus for their 'Amrit'? What happened to unobtanium? Humans dont care
Another confused character is Kiri. If she knows that she has close connection with Eywa and can control other animals, why is she so late in the fights? Is it like Eywa listens late only? After a number or Navis have sacrificed their lives? Same happened in 1st movie as well. When Neyteri says to Jake - ""Eywa has heard you"", I always wondered, why so late? If Eywa would have herad him like 15 mins ago, 1000s of Ometicaya lives would have been saved. But in that movie, I understand, that is for the dramatic effect. First Navis are falling back, they feel like everything is over, and then suddenly all the other creatures attack! And thats probably the only small gap in that part. Other than that storyline was pefect. Humans had a clear mission, extract unobtanium. Navis had clear motive, to fight back sky people and save their homeland. Anyways.When in the last fight Miles sees Jake, he says, ""your son didnt have to die"". How did Miles know about Neteyam's death? There was no way he would have known that.And finally at the end, the unspoken love between Miles Avatar and Spyder is something confuses me again. Why Miles avatar has a soft corner for him? I know that he's human Miles son, but still. Those scenes just dont justify. Its probably just a begining plot for the next part where probably spyder will fight by Miles side. I am not sure, but in this part, it doesnt fit well.All in all, I didnt have a satisfying feeling after the end of the movie, which I get whenever I watch the 1st part. That one was absolute masterpiece."
"Stunning movie to actually watch (as is this original one) but the story line is basically identical to the original so why bother making a sequel?The story is just all over the place and not very coherent, and needs a very good edit.Humans are back on Pandora to set up a new home for human civilisation but then this is never mentioned again? Then later they mention everything being paid for by the Amrita harvested from the Tulkuns - in which case why is killing Sully so important? He's in the forest not the ocean.I also think Miles didn't have the scars on his face when his memories were taken for his recombinant (which he got on his first mission on Pandora) so he wouldn't even know Sully at all? Just a bit all over the place.If you want to watch a visually impressive movie just rewatch the first one. The story in that one actually makes a bit of sense and the visuals are just as good."
"Honestly, even though it's the sequel to an amazing movie like Avatar that came out back in 2009 my expectations were low because I didn't think it had a chance to be even close to the first one and I have to admit I was wrong.This movie is as good as the first Avatar. The visuals and the 3D made it amazing, and the story, even though very predictable, was still good. It also kept me entertained the whole time and I'd even watch it again even though the movie is super long.I'd definitely recommend it to all those who liked the 1st one because the movie really does get you to connect to the world of pandora and gets you to connect to the characters as well just like the first one did.James Cameron once again did an amazing job."
"Probably the best looking CGI ever put on film, it honestly makes those Marvel movies seem like nothing compared to it. Seriously, watching this in 3D Imax is a must for everyone. There is not one moment where you go ""that character looks so fake,"" or ""that character moves so fake."" This ain't no ""Black Panther"" type CGI here, this is some real stuff.Unfortunately the story isn't really that good, the acting is good for the most part but there are some ""iffy"" dialogue that could had been cut. Also there are way way too many unneeded subplots that just brings the movie to a halt, mostly involving the kids.Anyways, it is a good film, but the pacing, story, character motivation, and slow padded out middle part brings the score down. I would rather watch this over the first any day of the week, but it still isn't in the top 5 James Cameron movie though.I know people complain about the length, and I did feel it but it has to do with the pacing. Titanic is a long movie, but I can watch that and not think about the time.James' top 5 films are Terminator, Terminator 2, Aliens, Titanic, True Lies.7/10."
"Avatar: The Way of Water is the sequel to the first Avatar movie from 2009. This sequel is again directed, partly written and produced by James Cameron.In the film, Pandora is once again threatened by the Sky People, who have been out for revenge since their last visit and mainly target Jake Sully (Sam Worthington).Jake has to go into hiding with Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) and their children to protect them and the rest of their Na'vi tribe. For this they seek shelter with the water tribe of the Na'vi. Here they first have to respectfully learn the rules and customs of this tribe, so as not to stand out and not to cause further problems.For this sequel, James Cameron and the other writers have managed to come up with a good and appropriate story to introduce new unknown parts of Pandora. Jake and his family must now learn the new ways of life at the water tribe. Putting workouts back into the movie again can feel a bit repetitive. Most of these workouts are told and learned faster compared to the first movie. The film manages to not come across as long-winded with all kinds of different training sessions for the water tribe. It is sometimes strange to see characters suddenly do their new tricks so quickly and simply, without you as a viewer really seeing how they learned this exactly in the film. James Cameron also has three new Avatar movies planned, but whether this number is really necessary remains the question.For this film, James Cameron also reused some aspects of his earlier directed films such as Aliens and Titanic. For example, the military villains are reminiscent of the military from Aliens and the sinking ships in the water are reminiscent of Titanic.With the first Avatar film, James Cameron managed to change filmmaking techniques in the world of cinema in unique ways. With this sequel thirteen years later, he manages to do this again. In the beginning of this new film, he sticks to the familiar, familiar images and environments from the first film. Once the movie gets to the water and the water tribe, Cameron really knows how to change the movie in his new movie ways. In the thirteen years between the two Avatar films, James Cameron focused on improving certain film techniques, especially film techniques in and under water. For this he even had a new film camera designed and built. For example, he has found ways to record motion capture underwater. Thanks to this method of motion capture, the actors can now also show their emotions and their postures even better underwater. Seeing the film in 3D also makes the underwater scenes more beautiful and shows more credibly the environment and depths of these new underwater areas. This way it sometimes feels as if you as a viewer are also with the characters in the water.Furthermore, James Cameron has chosen to record this new Avatar movie in a higher frame rate. This method works well in the underwater scenes, where the Na'vi swim together and live with the new mysterious sea creatures in Pandora. In scenes from the water, this can come across as a bit strange and it seems as if you accidentally play the film in an accelerated manner.The story this movie focuses a lot on Jake and Neytiri their kids. The young actors who play these roles have such time in the film. Of this new, younger film cast, Britain Dalton knows how to carry the film well as the second son, who tries to be equal like his father and older brother. Kate Winslet has also made a comeback in a Cameron film since Titanic. She knows how to portray her role as a high figure in the water tribe. She also broke Tom Cruise's breath holding record for this role. She managed to hold her breath for more than seven minutes.In this sequel, Sam Worthington now has to play the father of his family in addition to being the leader of his tribe. He manages to juxtapose these two different roles well, but does not really do anything special with them. Zoe Saldana also ends up more on the sidelines in this sequel. The further, returning characters in this sequel like Sigourney Weaver and Stephen Lang come back in this sequel in a believable and acceptable way. It's just sometimes a bit strange to see Sigourney as an actress in her seventies playing a better-knowing teenager."
"Well, what did I expect? Great visuals but the story was poor. It was a remake but not as good. It was a bit silly and a bit boring. We've seen it all before I'm afraid to say. Talking to Whales?! Come on, this isn't a cartoon. I just didn't like how they pieces this film together.3 hrs Nat - Geo is all good but I can watch David Attenborough at home.Not terrible but just obvious and boring. It didn't develop the story at all which is probably why there are another three films planned.James Cameron has done some amazing films but this is not one off them I'm afraid.Another three films! It will ruin the first one I'm afraid to say. Think Star Wars!"
"I absolutely loved this movie and appreciate the the ard work out into it!The cgi was flawless, the acting was perfect (although there were a few akward moments from the children 💙) and the plot was thrilling.I was, however, disappointed in the music and how I barely about the metkayina and tulkun culture. I felt that it was a bit too focused on the battle and didn't focus enough on the clan that was housing the Sully's! The music was too referential and wasn't as spiritual or alien as I'd hoped, exception being neytiri's songcord which was absolutely captivating.I hope that in Avatar 3, these issues won't be present!And again, I loved this movie 💙💙"
"Each and every frame was a Piece of art, Experience in 3d was jaw-droppingly stunning. The story was simple, the meaning of life and death with water and the whole nature's beauty and people to admire such thing vs the greed of humans but this time with revenge. The family,duty and home aspect was just heart-warming, the fights were literally epic, each and every situation was chills, the background score was amazingly mixed and the acting it was brilliant the motion capture and voices were well suited to characters, the ending was meaningfull and emotional and the greatest thing of the movie the Cgi and visuals it was a masterpiece in that aspect, Literally it was the most beautiful movie i've ever seen."
"They shouldn't film the second part, they destroyed spiritual concept of the movie. Too much action, killing and so much boring. They lost story direction. And left bad guy alive, probably want to make the third part. So it's more about money than movie quality. I really don't know what happend and can't believe we've been waiting 13 years for this disaster to come out. I couldn't wait movie to end. I think only 15-20 min of movie are beautiful, when they show around nature and whales. Nothing else. It is sad to witness what they have done to such a beautiful story and movie (thinking about the first part). I don't know how many times I watched the first one, this one no need to watch ever again."
"In '99 we left the movie theatre awed and fascinated after watching the first Matrix movie. It was like nothing we have seen before. Then, after 4 years sequels came - the mediocre Reloaded and awful Revolutions. We left the movie theatre disappointed & feeling betrayed.Then in '09 another movie that was nothing like we have seen before came (at least visually). Avatar was telling a non-original story, but it was telling it in a new & fascinating way. And finally.... after 14 years this idiotic teeange-y mess came out and left us in more disappointment & resentment even worse than matrix sequels did.Where to begin to tell about this insult to original Avatar? Should we get frustrated to see the characters are stereotype American teenages? (Even ""forest people"" get bullied by so-called ""sea people"", oh dear, oh dear, oh dear...) Should we get surprised to see people of Pandora acting as mindless zealots? Didn't they have connection to the soul of the planet? What happened to their wisdom we witnessed in the first movie?Or better, we should forget about it & feel sorry for our 3 hrs 10 minutes that we can never get back. Even the excellent scenery cannot save this idiotic insult to Avatar universe.."
"Not as per expectations, no comparison with Avatar 1. Only attraction is under water life in 3D. Kids could enjoy more then adults. Movie is too lengthy, and found it difficult to wait for completion. Wait for some better movie and do not waste your time and money on this movie. It displays how egoistic human being is, desperate to destroy culture and environment. Not too different when British did with India or other slave countries. Just crush anyone coming your way in capturing target civilization or land or natural resources. It is sort of misuse of science and power, or basic nature of Arab invaders or British."
"The original Avatar was a ground breaking original with a classic story (pocahontas in space) and it was always going to be a tough act to follow.I found it dissappointing as a sequel although still very watchable in its' own right.What's good :Visually very very good (I watched in direct x and it was amazing)Although the film is over 3 hrs long you are still kept absorbed by the story and ongoing action.What's not so good :Too much a rehash of the original story with many of the original cast again (even those that died)Glib return of the 'sky people'.The film is so long most people are going to need at least one comfort breakShades of other films, e.g. A sinking ship (Titanic) mullet and axe (Braveheart) son is killed causes murderous rage (the patriot)Summary :
Our expectations are so high from the original offering (over a decade ago now) that any sequel was always going to have a major hill to climb.The thing I found most irritating is that Avatar; The Way of Water, almost had it. Was almost a classic sequel but failed by a lack of originality. The makers chose to rehash the original story instead of an actual continuation (an error made by so many sequels e.g. Independance Resurgence, The Magnificent Seven, Disney Star wars and many many others. )Don't get me wrong it is still a good watchable film in it's own right. Certainly better than those i've just mentioned.It's the fact it's so good that left a sour taste, it could have been great - had they chose to take the risk with a genuine sequel.The obvious sequel is the sky people return (which the film does) but instead the humans return and are so much better prepared for opposition with a different strategy e.g. The classic colonisation tactic of divide and conquer - get some tribes on your side and use them to help fight their enemies would have been interesting.Instead the skypeople 'just' arrive (as before) unapposed (as before) build a base (as before) and then have a rather thin link back to family Sully to get back to the 'big battle' scene.Would I buy this ? No (I bought the original avatar film)Would I watch this again ? Unlikely (although I will re-watch the original from time to time)Certainly worth a watch, a solid 7/10 but with a sense of dissappointment of an opportunity lost."
"I really hate to say this: the plot ruined the experience for what could have been a great movie. Creating stunning visuals by showing what you can create, when you throw absurd amount of money into VFX doesn't make a good movie.For me it shows again that visual effects, as stunning and groundbreaking they may be (which they are), should online play a supporting role in storytelling. Making it the main element of a movie results (at least to me) in a underwhelming experience.Without a story you simply get a compilation of some really great super realistic VFX shots stretched over 190 minutes. Maybe Cameron could have planned only two sequels instead of four and focused more on the plot developement. Much like the Hobbit movies this movie feels like butter put on too much bread."
"There a few things that made the way of water less satisfying than the original IMO. First the 3D effect was disappointing. I can't remember if it was exactly the same in the first, but in the second some things were out of focus, but in a jarring way. Like spear and arrow tips were coming out of the screen, but if you looked directly at the instead of the characters face, it looked off. There were multiple places where if you looked somewhere other than the focal point on screen things looked bad.Second the was quite a bit of spoon feeding, from dialogue, to defeating the purpose of avatar joining by just being able to talk directly to sea creatures.Thirdly having the rare material switch, and also surprisingly low value was funny. Like maybe 80 million was a massive amount when the movie started production, but you'd need to kill over a thousand whales to get a billion, which seems a tall order.Finally the whole story ends up in a worse position. In the first avatar they send the humans packing. This time they've only partially defeated the old villain's backup. Generally I think a new villain would've been better. A lot of things could've been cut without affecting the plot, like the relationship with the whales. They already established empathy with nature in the first."
"Except you don't have to imagine. It is happening everyday and no one cares. Let's all do a little something about it the world will be a better place for sure.And let's not kill earth. Save earth save humanity this is the take away I got from an amazingly well done film.Beautiful visual, touching story, marvelous technology and a deep and thoughtful message with an alarming warning. Let's give a hand to James.I almost cried and I felt guilty for not doing anything to stop the current way of trading nature. This is a film everyone should watch. Old and young. So maybe one day we can unite for earth and for nature."
"This movie satisfies the expectation so far with its visual beauty. The movie is lively as if it were filmed directly from Fandora. I felt like I was watching a natural documentary. Each animal movement was natural, making it seem like it took a picture of an actual animal. The long wait was worth it. However, regret was noticeable. This abroad element was also disadvantage. This is because the movie is unnecessarily long, and the development is delayed that much. So, defending on audience, it can be boring. Also, what is really regrettable was the narrative. The plot was simple enough to write in just one line. The confrontation structure is also simpler than previous one.And in the middle of the movie, it is mentioned that migration is the goal of human, and focusing on this peripheral content will definitely be prepared for the follow-up.Let's keep an eye on it!"
"Hollywood must think it's a great story to make any sequel BIGGER than the first one. In this story we have the sky people come back with BIGGER weapons, MORE of them and seeking a BIGGER valued resource (whale gland fluid).Soon as the film starts the sky people land with huge engine blasts destroying basically 2-3 Home Trees yet int the first film it took almost the whole film to bring down just one. Instead of sticking with the native language, we will just say the Sully understands it like English and now we can have English throughout the film.Then we go whale hunting, but with a BIGGER, FASTER hard shell variety and they can talk to the natives (but no animals could in the first film). I actually found this scene to be quite offensive and brutal basically mimicking whale hunting. Also, I was very offended that an Australian was hunting whales given that the Sea Shepherd who protect whales is mostly Australian run. They should have used Japanese or another whale hunting race.Then the kids factor in to this to make it a nice sweet family film, except the morals in this second film we are teaching our young kids is also quite offensive.Overall I found the storyline to be very weak and too many last minute save-the-day, made for very poor writing."
"Watching Avatar 2, I felt the rare thrill that comes from an economical purchase. Movie tickets are expensive. Most of the time, I come out of the theater feeling like I could have waited a few months, rented the movie for a quarter of the price, and had a near-identical experience to the one I just had. But as corny as the oft-repeated promotional line is, it's true. Avatar 2 is what theaters were made for. Say what you want about James Cameron, but that man knows how to put on a show, and the show he puts on is worth every penny.Avatar 2 engaged me so completely that I barely noticed its three-hour runtime until the third act. It's no masterpiece, of course: Cameron's struggles with natural dialogue and compelling storytelling are as evident here as they are in the first film. The cast makes up for it, save Sigourney Weaver, though I don't blame her. A seventy-year old woman playing a child was a dubious move, and though she clearly tries, you feel the effort before you feel the character underneath it.Worthington's performance as a dreadlock-sporting father is damn good. He's more comfortable with the accent this time around. The role he plays demands a certain sensitivity: the Jake Sully in Avatar 2 isn't the bold, plucky youth from the first film. He's older, but not especially wiser; he works desperately to secure his family's safety, but we're given the impression that despite how much he loves his family, he doesn't quite know how to be a father. ""This is a family, not a unit,"" his wife Neytiri tells him after he scolds their son.The story is there, and it's fine. Disappointingly, it follows a similar structure to the first film. We get the fish-out-of-water trope (though a bit more literal this time), the cross-cultural conflict, the nasty humans doing nasty things to get some cool substance, and the chaotic final battle where the degree to which you'll sympathize with either side depends on how effectively the blue people have won you over. Its main difference is in its focus on family. In the first film, Jake was on his own with the Na'vi. In this one, Jake's family has their individual struggles; each of them has to integrate, and some of them find it harder than others.That said, none of them find it so hard that there's any real tension, and that's my main issue with the first half of the film. Cameron has no apparent interest in challenging or hurting his characters until the finale. There is one scene with palpable danger, in which Jake's younger son faces off against a big fish. Apart from that, everything is smooth sailing for these landlubbers. Though the chief's wife warns them that they'll have to work, I don't recall ever seeing them lift a finger.The film's greatest strength, to no one's surprise, is its imagery. Every time I thought I'd hit an upper limit of amazement, Cameron would bust out some movie wizardry and completely shatter my convictions. I love movies like this, movies of pure extravagance and vision. Cameron brings the same love to the oceans that he brought to the forests of Pandora in the first film. His passion for nature (and his surprisingly comparable passion for funky submarines and crab robots) shines through almost every frame, and it's hard not to be swept up in it. I, for one, was enormously entertained.Avatar 2 did lose me towards the end. Its final battle is more brutal and kinetic than its predecessor's, but I don't know if that brutality is earned. In this one, the humans are more helpless, less trained, leading to a series of scenes that's more massacre than fair fight. There are a few moving bits scattered throughout the carnage, but it did sour me a bit on the film. Though Avatar 2 goes out of its way to make you hate its humans, making them comically nasty, it runs into the same problem as its predecessor: as sympathetic as its blue people may be, it's hard to root against the working stiffs."
"I really liked the update on the visuals, no complaints there. Coming from a guy who's always watching movies and specially keeping up with the latest videogames, I know what the 3D and CGI can offer out there, and I take my hat off to James Cameron for bringing the best special effects possible.But a movie cannot rely solely on special effects. Nor an upcoming franchise, for the matter.I feel the story was shallow, basically a retelling of the first movie, almost following the same chapter line of thought. Jake's family finding a new Naavi tribe (same as before, check). Quaritch's learning how to be an Avatar (same as before, check). Lame excuse for Quaritch to hunt down Jake's ENTIRE FAMILY based on pure revenge, even though Jake laid down his mayor's staff and even LEFT the continent so humans could continue destroying the forest (by the way, fk the forest Naavi, right, the concept of ""FAMILY STAYS TOGETHER"" is so hypocritical here). Jake's family struggling to fit into the new sea family (same as the movie before). The Turuk's brain oil, a new source of riches for greedy humans to fight over (same goals as before, btw, what happened to the HOLY unobtanium mineral which was supposed to be the ONLY reason for the Sky People to be on Pandora?). A bunch of new misterious kids running everywhere without mothers or fathers (leaving us viewers confused without answers! How come Quaritch had a son??? Or Sigourney Weaver's Avatar wich btw FAILED her soul transfusion??).Anyways. There is more, but you got the picture.The story was cold, lame and predictable in so many levels. Makes me wonder if James Cameron thought of repeating the same plot in order to attract new audiences after 13 years, to attracat this public which still haven't watched the first Avatar, preparing them for the next 4 movies to come till 2026."
Some old movie scenes came to mind when I watched this movie. First was the Sponge Bob Movie where Plankton goes into Sponge Bobs head and finds out that his Brain is made of cotton candy. He comes out out of his ear gasping that it's to sweet in there!Yes Avatar 2 is like that in the Visual Effects Department. Your eye are bombarded for 3 hours with rainbow colors and all sorts of visual until you reach the point where your brain goes numb to all of it.Honestly that who one hour section of Kids in the Water could have been reduced to 20 minutes.The Plot really shows the problem with Cameron in that he is fixated on projecting stories from the wrong time period into a modern society. Pocahontas for the first move and now we are at the Moby Dick stage in history.The Science of the show is fine for the most part but then comes the Major Plot hole that no one addresses which is that we cannot breath the air on Pandora! Everything involving this topic is kind of fixed by Magic masks that never run out of air and never fall off. I suppose in the next film they will put one over the entire planet just to make the overall plot direction make some kind of sense.My theater experience was that all of the Kids 16 and younger seemed very excited and Happy with the story when it ended and all of the Adults were just kind of happy that it finally ended.
"It was a very nice cinematic experience but the script was borderline awful.The character development was awful. The bad guy turns into an avatar and the only thing he wants is to kill Jake Sully. That is pretty much it. He just wants to kill him.He is in Pandora, the whole thing about the metal they were mining is gone. The humans also found a way to gain 80 million dollars from every whale-like being they hunted but this never comes into play.The adopted daughter of Jake Sully has some powers that aren't specific. The whole movie feels like a documentary of the deep sea.There are too many cliches in the movie and some awful dialogues. Like the phrase ""if you can't get out of it, get into it""
Jake Sully is also a terrible person.The only thing the bad guy wants is him but he chooses to endanger his family and even though he leaves his forest tribe,he is putting in danger the sea tribes that agreed to host him and help him.And the only guys who are actively hunting him are like 4-5 people. The stakes are too low.There were some good moments but there were some ridiculous moments in the movie.They focused on the beauty of the movie instead of the essence.I don't doubt it will do very well at the box office. After all it is a very good 3D quality."
"After 13 years James Cameron invites us back to theaters to catch us up with former Marine Jake Sully and his family as a familiar threat returns to the extrasolar moon, Pandora. In all honesty I wasn't overly excited to sit through this 3-hour 12minute of a film. Don't get me wrong, 2009s Avatar blew me away visually when it came out and while the story is fine it didn't leave me clamoring for more with its predictability. I remember figuring out the entire film within the first 15 minutes and was able to recite the accompanying dialogue more often than not. With over a decade to improve technology and film techniques, I expected the visuals to be even more outstanding and worthy of a view. As for the storyline itself I wasn't necessarily ""feeling"" the hype to see the newest film, Avatar: The Way of Water. The vagueness of the trailers kept me on the fence right up to an hour before movie time. Yes, I toyed with the idea of just getting a refund and waiting until I could stream this one at home.Damn glad I didn't.Avatar: The Way of Water is one of those rear sequels that is more of the same in many aspects, yet also manages to be entertainingly different. And better. Yes, much better than the original. I'm not sure how Cameron pulled it off, but he did so beautifully.Much like Avatar, Avatar: The Way of Water is far from subtle or nuanced in its messaging or morality. The plot is straight forward and simple. The good guys are practically saintly, and the bad guys are purely, unabashedly evil. Very black and white, little to no shades of gray. The dialogue can be eye-rolling cheesy and pedestrian. Even some of the acting of a couple of the new characters is weak.Here's the thing......None of those matters.Avatar: The Way of Water works, nonetheless. It's as visually stunning as expected. I ended up seeing it in 3D and WOW. Just W-O-W. There's one underwater sequence alone where I felt completely submerged in the world of Pandora and its sea life and it was worth the price of admission alone. But yes, the visuals are spectacular and hold up throughout the entire film. Slow clap and a chef's kiss for all the artists that once again brought all the colors and textures of Pandora to life. And the underwater scenes? Mind blowing!But TwoW happily delivers more than just pretty pictures.The Soundtrack is as rich and dynamic as the visuals. The action is thrilling to edge of your seat intense. I found myself quite anxious and holding my breath numerous times. The familiar is interwoven with the new world building/expansion seamlessly. The characterization is meatier and makes for a more compelling story. The focus of family kept me fully invested in who these people are and what happens to them (for better or worse). At this point I just have to say, effing kids! Uggh. A phrase that became my personal mantra. There are also some nice surprises to be had not only in the characters that pop up but in the actors behind them.Avatar: The Way of Water is not only worth the 13 year wait, but also definitely worth the trip to your local movie theater. Yes, it's a long film (skip the soda and get an Icee), but it certainly didn't feel like it. My interest never wavered; my eyes never left the screen. I never regretted seeing this one at the theater. Unlike so many of the highly anticipated, hyped films this year, Avatar: The Way of Water actually delivers an amazing, entertaining movie going experience. This is a film meant to be seen on the big screen and should be viewed accordingly. Can't emphasize that enough. Avatar: The Way of Water is good old movie magic and I thank James Cameron for delivering it to us once again. Like the Na'vi, I see you Cameron and your movie is as badass as feral Neytiri.Can't wait to see the next installment in 2024!Until then Avatar: The Way of Water gets a 9.5 from me."
"Avatar: The Way of Water13 years later, Avatar is back! And it didn't not disappoint. Jake Sully and Ney'tiri have formed a family and are doing everything to stay together. However, they must leave their home and explore the regions of Pandora. When an ancient threat resurfaces, Jake must fight a difficult war against the humans.It's just gorgeous! Every single scene and frame in the movie is an art piece of itself. Its like a 3 hours tour in a museum. It is too visually appealing that you can just sit there and watch without hearing any word and knowing nothing about the story, especially if it is experienced in 3D. (James Cameron suggests it should be watched in 3D since it was ""conceived as a 3D experience, shot with 3D cameras, and edited especially to be seen in 3D.""Although the visuals were stunning, the movie itself wasn't really that great. With the same antagonist as the last movie and a very similar plot with just some minor changes to the settings and characters, Avatar: The Way of Water fails to keep the audience attached throughout the whole 3 hours runtime. Additionally, there were so many scenes that were just there for us to look at and although those were very beautiful, their abundance can make the movie feel even longer than 3 hours to some people.To conclude, the movie was stunning to look at but visuals don't make up a whole movie.Score:8/10."
"Avatar Way of the Water was everything and more! I Generally prefer series to standalone movies and this series has me hooked. Seeing it in 3D with my 10yo is now a core memory. Absolutely brilliant film, visually stunning, fantastic story! An absolute must-see in theaters but we will be watching it over and over again when it streams. Will probably head to the theater to see it again. Very gripping, edge of your seat story. I could have watched another three hours of just them living thee lives. This time there is a definite set up for more films and stories. The first few mins really had to create a story
That wasn't necessarily there. But it worked!"
"""Bro"", ""Cuz"", ""No!"" (with appropriate anguished scream), and snarls. That's basically the dialog and plot summed up.There was almost zero character development with the film basically saying, 'so these kids were born, here's you new cast' in the first two minutes. Oh and there was a baby left behind in the first one apparently? Oh, and ""all the soldiers that we thought you liked in the first one, well we've macguffined a way for them all to come back. I mean, we only have three hours, how could we possibly introduce new likeable characters in that time?'
There were some huge leaps in there too. We all know that the estranged kid of the evil guy is going to get Stockholm syndrome when captured then find his way back to the light side, etc. But kid who 'hates' the sky people is happily wandering around the bridge on their ship within 5 mins of being captured.The brothers do something against the rules, get told off, apologies, then do this same routine about 6 times in the film. Unrealistic and poor writing if you can't find better reasons to have characters do things.The visuals swing between absolutely amazing (particularly the motion capture work where humans are interacting with avatars. Wait, I think there was only actually one avatar in the movie, some side character scientist for a few seconds), and not very impressive computer game graphics. I've seen better train crashes in my VR headset.And I think that's part of it, we now have VR, I've experiences being in the water with whales and jellyfish in VR titles that were just as good, if not better, than the underwater scenes in the film. The CGI and 3D was amazing a decade ago, now it's just meh.The script seemed to be there to give an excuse to show pretty graphics, but when the graphics aren't that special, then it's really obvious no one who knew how to write scripts or plots was involved.Like so many great directors, JC seems to have fallen in love with making films with CGI rather than enhancing then, like was done in Terminator 2 and films like Contact. Even in films like Gravity, which was almost all MoCap and CGI, they took their rightful place as secondary to the plot.It did look good for the most part, I didn't get too bored, I didn't walk out. It's a day later and I don't remember much any of the characters as none were that important to me. Maybe mini-mystic-angel-Sigourney but her interesting story was barely mentioned.Doubt I'll bother seeing the next however many."
"""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is essentially Galactic Cowboys and Indians with Space Whales and Maoris.Turns out the way of water is endless a bit like this epic 3 hour min 12 minutes bloated (some say epic) cinematic masterpiece from the genius of James Cameron.On that subject I think his genius is overrated.James steals ideas from every corner of the world and puts them in a big movie melting pot and calls it his own.As plagiarism goes he's a genius because few people have ever called him out on it.However his films continue to break box office records even if they are made in different centuries.Cameron is not exactly prolific.To his credit though this second edition has already received 12 wins and 45 nominations and it isn't even Academy Award season yet.One of the biggest distractions in this film is Aussie actor Sam Worthington's outrageous New York/Bronx accent.When he made the first movie he'd been living in his car and admitted in interviews to struggling with the American accent for his his Marine character, Jake Scully.Fast forward a decade or more and it's so pronounced now it sounds weird coming from the mouth of a Na'vi and worse in the narrator role.Most of your faves from the first blockbuster return although they make look a little different...no spoilers here.Plus the addition of Kate Winslet from Cameron's ""Titanic"" days who performed all of her underwater stunts herself...even breaking Tom Cruises underwater record from ""Mission Impossible"".She has a big set of lungs.I guess I'll have to wait for another sequel to get Leonardo DiCaprio into the casting...although word on the street is he's more a dry land type of guy.I'm a family man and I love my children, however when a franchise starts relying on the offspring in a ""family story from Disney"" to move the narrative forward I find that means the franchise has cracks.It's weakening the storyline into some PG13 adventure film that's getting so sugary sweet you can almost taste the saccharine.Watch out for: another Aussie Brendan Cowell as Scoresby, a ruthless whale killer milking the creatures for an overpriced anti-ageing liquid.Plus Kiwis by the pound in Jermaine Clement (Dr. Garvin) and Cliff Curtis (Tonowari) and plenty of Maori influenced tattoos and Hakas.Zoe Saldana (Neytiri) is wasted in this sequel with most of her lines involving either snarling like a mad beast or crying mournfully.In the last 1/2 hour of this movie we see a huge ocean going vessel sink and no band playing on this one.Let's face it if there is one thing in Cameron's wheelhouse as a director it's sinking ships.He hates when sea going vessels actually float as intended.Hold onto your deck chairs Avatar 3 is coming out next year.Collectively the sequels will cost over $1 billion.JC always threatened there would be at least 3 of these films...maybe 5!!See this at the movies in 3D with FX to fully appreciate its grandeur."
"Before watching it, I thought it might be as good as the last one. After watching it, I thought why wouldn't I just watch Finding Nemo?The first hour: the same as avatar 1
The second hour: similar to Finding Nemo
The third hour: another version of TitanicI was quite disappointed in terms of the plot. The entire story is just so mundane and poorly made. You can predict what will happen next since it is so average and lacks twists and high-quality drama. I can't believe it was produced by Cameron as the editing is very bad, the special effects are no different from the first one, and the movie is very mediocre.Overall, it is a movie with high expectations and low results."
"A beautiful visual experience with a storyline told for it's future!It's a absolutely spectacle, sit back and enjoy the stunning visuals this movie represents.The use of CGI was flawless and that truly helped with the great character development each character had.Chapter one felt like a documentary, a trip throughout the wonderful world that is Pandora.The close ups were used perfectly, and brings you so much closer towards the action scenes!Some kills were horrific and not really for the younger audience and more brutal than in the first one...
The storyline was a big dragged out but important for it's storyline and the future of the Avatar movies.I truly enjoyed the full 3h this movie had to represent!"
"James Cameron makes a triumphant return with the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 box office hit, Avatar. The biggest problem this film faced was the significant time jump between release dates, however, Cameron managed to maneuver around this, creating a captivating story that left plenty of room for further developments. Unlike the first film, this one focused heavily on emotions and familial relationships. It created the bond that so many of us long for when it comes to friends and family, and it made the events of the film a little more harrowing as they established very quickly that nobody is safe. Much like the first film, this one continued the storyline of environmentalism and colonization, effectively putting the audience in a place that has them rooting on the side of the Na'vi - and against their own people.In order to tell this story in the manner that was intended, Cameron waited until he had the technology available to create an immersive world for his audience. Especially with the use of IMAX and 3D effects, the viewer can feel transported to Pandora for the full length of the film, and will grow to miss this universe when the credits roll and the screen fades to black. The CGI for this film was masterful in every way and it can be difficult to find a cast that possesses the talent to perform with the technology that will assist in building this world. That being said, casting director, Margery Simkin, could not have done a better job. While the entire cast provided wonderful performances, Zoe Saldana (Neytiri) stood out with her emotional performance as not only a warrior, but a mother and wife as well. It was refreshing to see that, although she has different priorities now, she still held on to her values and beliefs in the same manner as the first film.The only thing that I felt this film lacked was a memorable soundtrack, as it seemed to blend in to the background of the film and was not as noticeable to me. However, this is not always a bad thing. It was still an important aspect in creating the desired atmosphere, and it did not overshadow the incredible action sequences that appeared throughout the entire film.With perfect pacing on a three-hour story that left me wanting more, it comes as no surprise that this film is quickly approaching the coveted $2 billion box office mark that very few films have seen - one of those being its predecessor, and another being Titanic (1997), all with the same director. Whether you are a fan of the franchise, director, actors, or just mildly interested in the story, I recommend seeing this film in theaters as it is a heartwarming and thought-provoking experience that is sure to make you excited for the third film."
"I'll keep this short but this was a nice sequel to the first entry in the series. The cgi is stunning, the characters are further developed and they even add in some quality characters as well.The film is a little too long, but that's because of Cameron taking his time with the scenic scenes, which are nice to look at.Even the return of the same villain is enjoyable with the development of the colonel taken in steps I did not see coming.My only complaint, which is me absolutely nitpicking, is this film doesn't quite wrap up the ending as well as the first one. But I believe this is because Disney and Cameron are banking on fleshing our future films for Avatar so they are leaving it wide open for at least one more film and probably two more.Overall, I enjoyed the movie and I really liked the first one. I'm definitely going to rewatch when it comes to streaming services and most likely will get the UHD Blu-ray to show off my OLED. Not quite as good as the first Avatar but it comes real close.7.8/10."
"Finally after 13 years we get to see the second part of it. In terms of duration this is really a big movie which i knew after searching about it. It never felt like a 3hr movie. The story itself is immersive and intense so we will just flow with it. It really brings back the childhood memories back then in 2009Who ever giving this movie a 3 to 6 actually didn't watched the movie as a movie.(read below if you are among those 3 to 6 reviewers)Also who ever is thinking that they started making avatar 2 from 13 years then dude you don't know nothing about it for, your information they have started to work on the movie after 2015 and there was some more things that back tracked them in making the movie so kindly know about stuff and then talk about it.Everyone suddenly becomes professional story writers and Directors to give a review but in reality ""listen bro you aren't going to get any attention as you never did at school or P. E class or at high school you probably are that little Billy at college with 5 ft height,fat and ugly, and with big tummy and probably can't even sprint"""
"Spiteful ""Bad guys"" wanted to get the ""good guy"" and there wasn't much depth.In avatar 1 the avatars had a purpose to get the minerals under the tree of life. In avatar 2... there was nothing pushing the plot forward except keeping family safe.Other than genocide of the natives to prevent guerilla warfare there was nothing motivating the sky people go after Jake. They could clearly just burn it all down if they wanted. (Note shuttle landing at beginning of movie)I don't really see any character arcs or transformation throughout the film. (Some of the kids took on accountability but nothing drastic) Although it was cool to see new creatures I didn't see it drive the plot forward.The 3D and IMAX are great but don't go expecting as much plot as the first film."
"This film is absolutely amazing! I love everything about it! Love the kids love the parents love the comedy and the character development through out the entire film! It can't get any better!Seeing Jake and Neytiri again and as parents made me the happiest Avatar fan! It was so beautiful to watch their kids blossom! Not to mention to know that their children have both or their mother and father's traits! Both Lo'ak and Neteyam are just like Jake in so many ways and Kiri, although she's an adventurer like her mother, she's also an explorer like Neytiri. And young Tuktirey is just too adorable! She's so free spirited already! However the thing that grinded my gears was seeing old faces.Seeing the same crew aka ""sky people"" that passed away in the first film come back and add on to their terror from the first film! It was just terrible and annoying! Oh my goodness, the way the crew slaughtered those poor animals! And not too mention poor Jake and Neytiri had to bury their first born because of the war that was caused by Quaritch! He's so mean that Quaritch! And Jake almost died and so did spider it was just so many emotions!But in conclusion, the film is beautiful. The water makes you just want to take a dive and never leave the ocean. And the breathing techniques that were being used seemed like they helped a lot. The film was amazing. I can't wait to see what's in store for Avatar 3."
"The 1st Avatar was a fantastic movie experience, with a great story and amazing actors, magnified inside a beautiful, hypnotic, and highly fascinating representation of a new world, Pandora.Avatar 2 is a ludicrous pile of non-sense actions, empty characters, inconsistent storyline, awful dialogues, the whole wrapped inside nice visuals.But nice visuals are NOTHING if everything else is a crap.What a failure!What a shame for Cameron! How could he let that garbage out?Nothing works. Anybody could have warned him about that obvious matter of fact.13 years, only to kill the genius artistic creation which was Avatar 1.So sad!"
"I so wanted to love this as much as i loved Avatar. I so wanted to want to see this film twice at the pictures......and i guess you've worked out that when i finally left, after 3 and a quater hours, my bubble of deisire had well and truely been popped!Look, this film is good, and without a doubt the graphics are 'out of this world', but if the film is so long that when you start thinking to yourself, ""These seats are really comfy"", and ""I wonder what sound system they use here"" then the film isn't that good. It's about an hour too long. The middle sags, heavily, and there are story holes so large an universe could fall into them......sorry to say, this isn't Avatar."
"Don't know where to start with this one! The art Dept and production Dept work is an easy 10 out of 10. But I give the movie 5 out of 10, because...well because the story(!) plot, was rubbish! To put it bluntly. I can see that it would take a good 10 years to develop and produce all the CGI but, but, but. Don't know what to say. I'm a professional architect by trade and we have a thing in our world called 'the gold-tap effect'. Maybe it's more of a syndrome. Anyway, the gold-tap effect goes something like...'people think something's good just because it's gold-plated', so you take something as ordinary as a tap and show to everyone and it's - yawn - a tap! But the moment you fold-plate it, everyone thinks it's amazing. Because, well, it 'must be cos it's gold-plated'. Reality is it's still a tap. Plus anyone that spends a great deal of time and effort gold-plating a tap is a fool (to put it mildly). With this film we have pretty much every one of the 'team's' previous movies rolled into one, including (bizarrely) - 'Titanic'. I was bored after the first 30 minutes or so. The rest of the film was utterly predictable and formulaic. So much so that the spoilers in this review would be to explain the plot of the next instalment, which none of us know anything about but which will be entirely predictable. So much so, I won't bother to go and see it. The other thing I must state is that thanks to perhaps one of the most disturbing 'acts' in any film ever, the whole 'whale-hunt' section was utterly horrific. I would suggest this alone should have suggested to the films makers, it should have been described as a sci-fi horror. I was so shocked, that this scene was being presented as 'entertainment' that I found myself wanting an excuse to leave the cinema. It might have been 'necessary' to the story, to show how innately evil and sadistic people are (seemingly by default too), but if there are that many of those types of people on this planet, then we and all life on this planet, truly are doomed. Then some people might look at me incredulously and say quietly 'it's all made-up CGI'. In which case I'd point out the whole film is made-up CGI, so why bother with any of it. Towards the end (the last hour or so!) I found myself sniggering at the antics and ineptness of the film's lead, Mr Sully. Who appeared to be largely clueless about the whole predicament. Thus rendering his character as an anti-antagonist. Perhaps the village idiot. So much so that it was his ever suffering wife/partner, who ended up going around cleaning up all his mess (literally) and 'taking-out' pretty much all the 'bad-guys' single handed...while Sully went around doing...?!? Dunno. And here's another thing, I must put bluntly, where do film-making story tellers think they're coming from showing the 'good guys' suffering terrible horrors and deaths whilst the 'bad-guys' have easy, quick deaths? The message I get from that approach is 'it's better to be a bad-guy'...cos you suffer much less. The scene with the 'arm' and the 2inch diameter cable was risible, to the point t of 'monty-python-esq'. What's the betting that 'bad-guy' comes back in the next thrilling instalment as a one-armed Captain Ahab, pirate. Industrial sea-life killer. And as for the main protagonist 'Quaritch', with his outcome in this film...really! Really!!! These films are supposed to be entertaining but they're by and large more frustrating and morally twisted beyond understanding."
"Avatar: The Way of Water is a movie with a predictable story from beginning to end, with only one real mystery that will most likely not live to the theories that are going to be created around it.The movie is set ten years after the first Avatar, where we see Jake and Neytiri with their family. Not just their family, but those humans that had decided to stay on Pandora.Ten years past and the humans are back, and it's in the first minutes of the movie that you immediately see the illusion that is the story that James Cameron tries to sell. Because had they done the smart thing, humanity could've taken Pandora with almost no effort. Everything else about the Na'vi putting up any fight, lies with the incredible convenience they can use any lifeform of Pandora to fight on their side. The story of this movie can be reduced to Cameron taking the occupation of North America by those of the Old World, and adding several convenient fighting options against the invaders.Jake is the family man trying to close the holes in the dam with his fingers. Neytiri is either complaining, angry, complaining and angry, or showing she's no better than those she hates.The journey and fate of their sons and daughters is just too predictable. To the point you get to not even half the movie, that is over three hours long, and you can already accurately guess who's going to make it or not.There's really just one character that holds an interesting mystery. That knowing Cameron and what he did in this movie, we can already guess what the answer to the mystery is. At least I'm almost sure the answer is staring everyone in the face.And of course because new enemies are apparently hard to make, Cameron had to come up with an excuse to bring back the old ones. An excuse that comes into conflict with another new miraculous resource unique to Pandora, as if Unobtanium wasn't enough.The movie is mostly supported by visual effects, that are unsurprisingly some of the best I've seen on any movie. With an adequate but not at all groundbreaking soundtrack.Thirteen years later and to see that story wise this was the best James Cameron could come up with, does show why Cameron said what he said about Terminator: Dark Fate. The story in this movie is nothing new, nothing never seen before, it isn't even that well executed. Considering Jake knew humans would of course come back one day, to see how surprised they were that the humans came back says everything anyone needs to know about this movie.And with the exception of just one character, none of the old and new characters really saves the story of the movie. That I excepted a lot from.Avatar: The Way of Water is a good movie, heavily supported by VFX. But story wise it's no Infinity War or Endgame. And if this is the best Cameron can do story wise, then any future sequel will have very little to stand on."
"I thoroughly enjoyed the original Avatar and whilst the special effects and graphics of the sequel were stunning that's the only reason I gave it 2 stars.The storyline is weak with many unbelievable elements, the script is full of very strong American family and military influences which are cringe making in the extreme and its too long (3 hours too long in my opinion!!)We would have left early if we hadn't been with friends but turned out they felt the same and the general murmur of those round about us as we left was that it was rubbish🤷‍♀️ ...certainly won't be going to the next sequel."
"...from major publications that want to sound ""cool"", ""unique"" and ""alternative"". No one really cares for their critiques anymore anyway. Just like people begun losing interest in award ceremonies too because they give the awards to films no one really cares for.This is an AMAZING film and that is what cinema is all about. Cinema has been quite dead the last few years and this film brings backs the excitement of good old days. Good and memorable story, exceptional visuals, amazing soundtrack.. All for three whole exciting hours.. What more could you ask for? Definitely worth a night out at the movies."
"I have never written a review for a movie, even if I have really disliked it, however I felt compelled to do so because of this monstrous film.A three hour and twelve minute orgy of completely unnecessary CGI devoid of any story or plot line.I have never not wanted to see a alien whale frolic in the ocean with a jaded teenager as much as I have during the hours of torture that was this so called movie.It boggles the mind that with a $400 million the best that the director and studio could come up with was essentially a mockumentary about alien wildlife.The only reason I have not given this review a 0/10 is because IMDB doesn't allow you to."
"The world created is truly amazing, he needs to hire someone to create a better storyline though, but it was still a 10. Lot of things unanswered, but they have plenty of time for that. If you get a chance to see the 3D screening, choose that one, the visuals were stunning. There were a lot of characters, but I thought they were explained well enough. I would have liked to have seen more backstory on his daughter, which wasn't his actually his. Some of the new animals were fascinating, and what the animals could do was fascinating. I'm hoping they build that out in the 3rd film. All in all a pretty good continuation of the first one, little sad at the end but it was needed for the story. I couldn't believe it took them that long to get back there, and I find myself curious on how long they live."
"Avatar....a special effects masterpiece. My eye were constantly marveling at how real things seemed. Truly a beautiful movie. I would live in Pandora if I could. That being said...
James Cameron seems to forget one major issue, movies are so much more than their visuals and special effects....though maybe he thinks he's a good writer...
I am surprised he is still as successful as he is, because all his major hits have dull one dimensional characters. Don't get me wrong visually the world of Pandora is beautiful and there is something about the carnal world that connects with everyone's dreams, but if you look at the details you see extremely boring things in such a beautiful world...like the characters arch's and their sad dull stories.There were scenes where it felt like we were watching an episode of Blue Planet, where we are being mesmerized by these new creatures and the new water tribes of Pandora...these scenes would go on for way to long and I would find myself distracted thinking ""what a dumb thing for Jake to leave his tribe thinking that would keep them safe"". The only justifiable reason for them leaving their tribe was so James Cameron could write a new part of Pandora into the story and have his ""water world"" special effects masterpiece, leaving story in its dust.As soon as they leave their tribe any chance of good story telling is abandoned. Though even before that there were already hints that Cameron still has zero concept of quality written side-characters, I'll name three obvious....
1. The terrible, terrible, and I mean terrible Spider boy.2. Sigourney Weavers weird hybrid child-which would have been a much better character as just a hyper Ewa-sensitive Sully child.3. The same dead villain from the first but in Avatar form...
And why why did he not have Zoe Saldana at the forefront? She is by far the best thing about these movies aside from Pandora it's self. She is placed on the sideline for almost the entire movie. She is a phenomenal presence, and it is uterally wasted in this movie.There was so much time spent on the children playing in the water and getting into ""after school cliche fights"" and almost no time spent on Neyteri and Jake's marriage. Jake is a bad father and husband from what I saw. Family was supposed to be the main theme but I saw no strong family values, no strong family bonds, no beautiful family scenes. What we do see are cliche ""misunderstood"" teenage characters with shallow undeveloped stories, a hard distant jarhead father and a subdued mother, all of which don't seem to learn anything. I started to think Cameron has no clue what family is.This movie left me feeling conflicted at best, one half of me wanted to jump into the screen with my family, live on the the beautiful Pandora, the other half of me wanted to yell at James Cameron to stop writing such terrible stories and characters.And for the love of all things on Pandora please just never include such a terrible character as the Spider boy again...He could have been erased from the entire movie and every scene he was in would have been better.Yes I loved watching the breath taking beauty that Pandora has become, it is a CGI marvel.I think I had high hopes for this just coming home from visiting Pandora at Disney world and having my children suddenly getting into the characters and toys. But I can honestly say, like the first one but even more so that these movies lack any character and story depth what so ever. There are even moments where you might think ""oh this could get interesting"", it doesn't."
"The original Avatar was a spectacular and ground-breaking film and retained its place as the highest-grossing movie of all time, overtaking Avengers: Endgame after being re-released in China in 2021. Director James Cameron (The Terminator, Aliens, Terminator 2: Judgement Day, True Lies) announced plans for sequels shortly after the success of the first movie, but it did not happen for thirteen years following repeated delays, so expectations were high, I was certainly most excited to see it. Basically, a decade has passed since the invasion of Pandora by the RDA (Resources Development Administration). Former human Marine Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), now living in the body of a genetically engineered Na'vi avatar, is the chief of the Omaticaya clan and has a family with Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña). They have two sons, Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton), daughter Tuk (Trinity Jo-Li Bliss), and adopted daughter Kiri (Sigourney Weaver), born from Grace Augustine's inactive avatar. They are also close to and help to raise a human boy named Spider (Jack Champion), the son of Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), he was born on Pandora and was unable to be transported to Earth as a baby in cryostasis. The Na'vi are dismayed when the RDA have returned to their home world; Earth is dying, the humans are hoping to use the alien moon for colonisation. Among the new RDA arrivals are 'recombinants', Na'vi avatars implanted with the minds and memories of deceased soldiers. One of them is Quaritch, whose DNA was preserved and has been resurrected, he commands the RDA's paramilitary operations. Jake stages a guerilla campaign against RDA supply lines, but Quaritch and his recombinants conduct a counterinsurgency mission against Jake and kidnap his children. Jake and Neytiri manage to rescue most of their children, but Spider is taken by Quaritch, who recognises him as his son. He decides to spend time with him to gain Spider's trust and turn sides, and in turn, Spider teaches Quaritch about Na'vi culture and language. Spider's knowledge of the Na'vi and their whereabouts puts Jake and his family in great danger, so they exile themselves from the Omaticaya and retreat to Pandora's eastern seaboard to join the Metkayina reef people clan. Jake is viewed with antipathy from some of the tribesmen due to his human heritage, but he and his family are allowed to take refuge with them. The family learn the ways of the reef people, Kiri develops a spiritual bond with the sea and its creatures, and Lo'ak befriends Tsireya (Bailey Bass), the daughter of clan chief Tonowari (Cliff Curtis) and his wife Ronal (Kate Winslet). Lo'ak gets into a fight with Tsireya's brother Aonung (Filip Geljo). Jake insists he apologises, upon his return, Aonung and his friends entice Lo'ak to a trip into the territory of a dangerous sea predator and leave him stranded. Lo'ak is saved by and befriends Payakan, a tulkun, an intelligent and pacifistic cetacean species (looks like a whale) whom the Metkayina consider their spiritual family. Upon his return, Lo'ak takes the blame on himself, winning Aonung's friendship, but is told that Payakan is an outcast among his species. On a trip to the Metkayina's Spirit Tree, Kiri links with it to meet her mother but suffers a violent seizure. She is healed by Ronal, but when Jake calls Dr. Norm Spellman (Joel David Moore) and Max Patel (Dileep Rao) for help, Quaritch tracks this call to the archipelago where the reef people live. Bringing Spider with him, he commandeers a whaling vessel which is hunting tulkuns to harvest their brain enzymes for creating anti-aging remedies called amrita. Quaritch brutally questions the indigenous tribes about Jake's location, but they do not reveal anything. He orders the whaling crew to kill many tulkuns to draw Jake out. Lo'ak mentally links with Payakan and learns that he went against the pacifist ways of his species, leading to him being cast out, and he back against the RDA whalers who killed his mother. The Metkayina learn of the tulkun killings, and Lo'ak leaves to warn Payakan, followed by his siblings, Tsireya, Aonung, and Rotxo (Duane Evans Jr.). They find Payakan being chased by the whalers, and Lo'ak, Tsireya, and Tuk are captured by Quaritch. With their children in danger, Jake, Neytiri, and the Metkayina set out to battle the humans. Quaritch forces Jake to surrender, but Payakan sees Lo'ak being threatened and attacks the whalers, igniting a fight that kills most of the crew and sinks the vessel. Neteyam manages to rescue Lo'ak, Tsireya and Spider but is killed after being shot. Jake faces Quaritch, who uses Kiri as a hostage, and in turn, Neytiri does the same with Spider. Quaritch initially denies his relationship with him but abstains when Neytiri cuts Spider across the chest. An accident causes the vessel to sink and turn on its side, with Jake, Quaritch, Neytiri, and Tuk trapped inside. Jake strangles Quaritch causing him to go unconscious, Lo'ak and Payakan rescue Jake while sea creatures summoned by Kiri help her save Neytiri and Tuk. Spider rescues Quaritch but leaves him due to his cruelty and rejoins Jake's family; Quaritch is seen flying away. After Neteyam's funeral, Jake informs Tonowari and Ronal that he plans to leave the Metkayina. However, they want and identify him as part of the clan and welcome his family to stay. Jake and his family accept and establish a new life at sea, with Jake vowing to keep fighting the human invaders. Also starring CCH Pounder as Mo'at, Edie Falco as General Frances Ardmore, Brendan Cowell as Captain Mick Scoresby, Jemaine Clement as Dr. Ian Garvin, Giovanni Ribisi as Parker Selfridge, Dileep Rao as Dr. Max Patel, and Matt Gerald as Corporal Lyle Wainfleet. Worthington as the father and leader, Saldaña as the faithful wife and mother, and Lang as the villain back from the dead are on fine form, as are new cast members Winslet and Curtis. It is true to say that the dialogue is predictable and the plot may be a little thin in comparison with the original, but there is no denying that it is visually stunning, the underwater exploration and battle sequences are most breath-taking, the use of colour and special effects to create the forests, water worlds and creatures of the alien planet are magnificent, I think it is definitely a sequel that was worth waiting for, a terrific science-fiction fantasy. Very good!"
"It was garbage. A movie with no plot. Very bad, nothing original and lack of connection with the first movie. If you love the original, this will make you mad. The effects were amazing but every character is americanised and the action is the same as in the first movie. More then half of the movie is just people fighting with guns and the whole point of having a connection with nature and animals is lost. In order to ride an animal you need to have a connection with nature, for Chris sake mother nature needs to allow you to be part of their family, how did the villan, the one who is hunting the na'vis, get to ride the dragons? It's badly written, a 10 year old would have done a better job."
"Why did they need to bring back the old guy? What was even the main threat? First it was stopping Jake and then it was the need to move to Pandora because Earth was inhabitable and then the de-aging thing in the whales. The story was very messy, with most of the film feeling like a promo for going to your city's aquarium. While visually cool, it's not groundbreaking and does not feel any more technologically advanced than other movies. Most of the film was the kids getting in trouble repeatedly. Overall it was repetitive and full of plot holes. They are so many side stories that are meant for sequel movies that it does not focus on the main story at hand. It does not need to be three hours either. Seriously, that fight scene was like 45 mins and the water avatars and whales just disappear halfway through the battle. Also, the last 30 mins of the film is a remake of Titanic, with the characters frantically escaping a sinking ship. Just stick to the first film and save yourself the time."
"What I saw here in the latter part of this too long National Geographic film was James Cameron's ego.Mr Cameron rehashed his films Titanic...music and the sinking of the ship, and Aliens 2...the stiltrobot walker( Sigourney in the outfit before), little Tuk going down the hole( Newt in Aliens2), and Abyss with the floating jellyfish things and Poseidon( not Cameron's but..) with the upside down ship and alot of breath holding.Nothing original in the story and not the music..apologies to the late James Horner.I never liked the first one but thought I would give this one a try. I started to fall asleep during those long insufferable mindless water sequences.Please, no more sequels. We need good intelligent storylines. Didn't the movie ""Idiocracy"" teach us anything?Positive thing: The wide reclining seats at the Cinema were wonderful and a blessing for a very long boring movie."
This movie was so great! I'll admit it was a little long but it's been 10+ years since the last one so I was cool with it. However it didn't drag on or seem boring everything was an add on and felt like brought character to the story. They did a great job connecting majority of the dots from the last one. I think you'll love it if you were a fan of the first one. There's more action. The story is similar to that of the first with a slight twist. There were only two things in the movie that I thought didn't make sense however it wasn't big enough points to damage the movie overall. I am in awe how great this sequel is.
"McDonald's is a popular restaurant and yet most can agree that the food itself isn't particularly good or healthy . Likewise, despite all of Avatar : The Way of the Water's glitz and glamour and box office success it too in my opinion is not very good.I went in with limited expectations as I found the first one to be fine but not exceptional. I found that one to be a story hijacked from other works but never did I think Cameron would hijack his own story and resell it to us. This second movie just takes all the major themes and applies it to the water people. For example , in the first one the banshees were the creature of fascination and in this one the tulkun whales just simply filled that void. Not to mention incredible amounts of time dedicated to simply just floating around with them. If I wanted to see this I'd have simply watched a real documentary like the Blue Planet.Furthermore for a 3 hour plus movie some critical elements were rushed through at the beginning. The introduction of the family really wasn't adequate given how many new members there were. Unfortunately because of this I had difficulty even telling apart the two brothers throughout the movie.Beyond this I even found the acting to be clunky and the script weak. It also has a rather dull ending. Is this villain really strong enough to make several movies on? I personally don't think so.For the people who enjoyed this movie I'd ask this: In 3 weeks after viewing the movie will you remember the name of the outcast tulkun or even the name tulkun itself, I suspect a majority would not. Further how many people would actually be able to take me through the story scene by scene in a months time? I reckon hardly any and it wouldn't be their fault , it's just not a powerful enough story. Of course many movies fall into this category , but with this one getting labeled by many as a classic then certain standards must be met in my opinion and this doesn't come close to meeting them for me."
"A tediously long watch, the much awaited sequel to the world's most successful film of all time is a bit of a misfire. A fairly basic plot, embellished with Cameron's trademark gigantic action set-pieces, fails to impress largely because of how the minimal substance in hand has been stretched to beyond infinity. Also, while Cameron's vision & his execution of it are laudable, it's all a case of been-there-done-that. The first film was revolutionary in terms of pushing the envelope & giving audiences a never-before-seen technical extravaganza - & one with heart. In this film there is no breaking of boundaries, & its heart feels manipulative, not organic. Cameron basically throws in the kitchen sink & ends up losing focus. The story's emotional core - that family needs to be protected at all costs - gets drowned out by the inordinate length, slow pacing & over-emphasis on the technical razzle dazzle.Tread with caution."
"The beauty of scenes and action in this movie is very impressive, but the story itself is quite bland. Sometimes it seems like dialogues were there just to fill in the space, leading nowhere. Also, there's no epic standoff, just one clan against a fishing vessel. The movie basically about kids getting constantly into trouble. It's not Matrix disaster sequels, but Avatar 2 is weak comparing to the first movie story-wise and epic-wise. Also some parts of the plot, like Spider being a son and of the colonel, or Kiri being a daughter of Sigourney Weaver's character seem to be illogically incorporated into the story."
"Yes, nothing new here, and the plot is predictable and on average level.I don't understand why they keep showing the military force personnel as dump headless evils. I'm sure todays technology could have done better in the battlefield against the Navi.Also, the sea creatures in such rich planet, is very limited in terms of biodiversity. Did they just copy many of their graphic works from Avatar 2008?They could have done better than this, you should always add, you have to add to the story, the visuals, the twists...Also, they should show us how people on earth reacting to these events, 2 movies and there is no connection to us, the people of earth.Not very bad but not good enough."
"Title says it all. I mean I still cannot believe it even after coming out from the cinema tonight I cannot believe it. I never liked HFR movies, I always had a soft spot for 3D but whenever I saw a HFR movie it sincerely disappointed me. Here the trick is that the entire movie is in 48 FPS and the calmer scenes have double frames achieving ""24"" FPS rather. Coming back to Pandora in the beginning an as a premise is narratively dull, and borderline cringeworthy sometimes but this is a similar blockbuster to the original Avatar so all the environmentalist and anti colonial themes/narratives will be similarly easy to ingest if rather not pushed full frontally exposed to your face. However building the world and characters around it kicks in with a better swing and swoosh (sploosh rather!?) after the first 1/3-rd of the movie and indeed it really shows the way of water. (seriously chef kiss!) Visuals are stunning again, WETA did an amazing CGI work here. The frames are so detailed and vibrantly vivid I had my jaw dropped.. only the explosions were still a bit cartoony unfortunately but did not distract too much to be honest. I really liked that this movie wasn't only about Jake & Neytiri anymore and had a good setup for plenty of supporting characters, Kiri especially I really liked how they treated her in the script.Could tell all once again what has been told before me and probably will be after, but seriously if you thought Top Gun: Maverick was a magnificent movie sequel (basically retelling the same story in a new cape) you will not be surprised that Avatar: The Way of Water double downs successfully on everything. Seriously, Cameron did it... he really did it... even if it took 13 years for him to do so... Mind-Blown...."
"Overall, the 13 year anticipation for the sequel to the highest grossing film of all time was NOT worth the wait. I strongly recommend everyone experiences this movie in a good theatre, just be prepared for a little over 3 hour runtime.It will blow your senses away, jaw dropping CGI, immense 3D, individual character development and arcs for the protganisits, makes you want to live in the world the Na'vi inhabit, primordial genesis llike origins of the world all pure green clear and blue, flaws - Neytiri just plays an angry woman role much departed from the first film and Jake Sully is also more one dimensional here but thats not a bad thing as the focus is on others who are emerging stars in this expanding universe.Children were being children, but the worst part was thin plot and story line. No new villain introduction."
"I mean, it's beautifully crafted. But if this is Jim Cameron's passion project, his magnum opus, then he'll have to accept that Avatar will only be remembered for its visual effects and nothing else. I'm going to steer clear of any commentary on the themes in the movies, but the words ""ham fisted"" and ""hugely unoriginal"" probably suffice. There are also times when the movie appears about ready to burst into a Disney musical number, and one unintentionally funny line from a whale creature that illicited sniggers and head shakes from the audience. It IS entertaining, and the technical brilliance on display is enough to warrant seeing it at the theater. Yet, this seems to be a series of movies that is trying to be its maker's epic, and to create some kind of legacy. In that regard it falls way short of greatness."
"The art from the original Dances With Smurfs has been recycled successfully. No budget was wasted on any pretense of plot. It's jam packed with maximum nonsense, just as set ups for morality lessons. Lessons such as: ignore evidence based medicine, depend only on prayer and acupuncture.The Blue conservatives fear any change. They don't have any sustainable economy, and depend on parasitical cargo culture. When the different races of blue people fight against each other, they switch to talking in English. All the races of blue people seem to share the same strange embarrassment and shame about nipples. This installment introduces implausibly miscegenetic half breeds. Presumably intended as an opportunity to lecture on metis oppression.The Blue Conservatives torture big ducks, to make them fight against the Red Liberals, who are trying to provide aid to the blue people as a sideline while protecting their own families. Oh, and a psychic whale goes all Moby Dick and Jonah and the whale, at the same time. Pretty much any random thought from anywhere else is crammed into this mess.The popcorn was ok."
"After years of hype and anticipation I got to see Avatar 2 in 3DHFR last night. It was quite simply the most visceral and immersive movie I've ever seen. While it's true that the 3 hour run time will put a few people off, and yes the film could easily be critiqed as bloated (particularly the 2nd act) I was so busy trying to pick my jaw up off the floor the run time didn't bother me at all. The characters are given time to develop and the script has nuance and heart. The greatest character of all is the world itself, Pandora is the most memorable locale in movie history and the expansion of the world and it's lore was brilliant. Add to that some of the best action sequences ever made and you've got a landmark moment in movie history. Whatever you do, DON'T see this in 2D because you'll be robbing yourself of one of the greatest cinema experiences you'll ever have."
"Why do human beings have to make these killing and invasion movies? Killing tulkun and clapping for it. Bragging that they won't never fight back and feeling so smart of using that, Really? So proud of human beings that we are so clever and capable, really? The movie created the whole beautiful world of Navi's and let you enjoy the wrecking of it from the high human beings, really? Don't say what happened in the end, the whole majority of the movie of killing and invasion doesn't get any beautified by the end. And why is it so enjoyable? Because of the fascinating machine and the ""professional human beings"" when they speak out all these precise numbers to manoeuvre the machines to hunt the Navi and animals? Why is that even fascinating?"
"The first ""Avatar"" was, for me, baffling. Whilst it undoubtably looked amazing, it's basic action-adventure plot and colonisation parable was undercooked, and why so many people went to see it so many times is beyond me. That said, I happily plonked my money down for a 3 hour plus sequel to a movie I didn't love and so have many others again. I didn't love this one either, but I'll probably see the third one. Maybe I'm part of the problem?Having lived on Pandora for several years, and started a family, Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) are dismayed when the Earthlings return to the planet and cause devastation. After a year of fighting, Quaritch, (Stephen Lang) restored from a memory back up and given a Navi Avatar body, leads and assault to eliminate Jake, who is leading the resistance. Aware of the threat on his family, Jake convinces them to flee and live with the Metkayina tribes, coastal dwellers who have a strong bond with the local marine life. But Quaritch is persistent and soon takes the war to them.I mean, it's the same film again, same villain, same awkward learning scenes as Jake and his family learn to bond with the wildlife, it's just on water rather than in the air. I didn't hate it though, too much money is spent on it for it not to have a basic level of competence to the storytelling. I didn't even particularly feel that gargantuan running time, there are enough action scenes to keep me entertained throughout. It's biggest selling point is that, even more than the first film, it looks amazing. The CGI work is pretty flawless, and WETA continue to be the SFX house to beat.I can't say that I ever really cared though. The kids, particularly in the conclusion, are just repeatedly captured and that's all they really are, a motivation for Sully to keep fighting and not run again. It's lacking in humour and the pacing feels off, rather than building to heartpumping action scenes and having rest moments, it's rather more a relentless marathon.It's fine. A visual feast but lacking in genuine substance - perfect then that it came out at Christmas."
"I liked the original but I didn't think it very special. I simply thought it was Dances with Wolves in space. I wasn't interested in any way, shape or form with the sequel.But I kept hearing good things about it. I kept noticing the massive box office take and realising frankly I didn't want to miss out - I didn't want to miss what could potentially be a visual spectacular on the big screen.Rest assured, it is a visual spectacular. Absolutely astonishing to watch. The best visual effects I've seen.But visuals aside, I thought it was a beautiful, hard-hitting, emotional (if simple) story. That simplicity doesn't detract from the experience in any way. What adds many layers to this simple story are the much deeper and personal characters on display here.I was completely swept up in this simply amazing film. I'm so glad I saw it on the big screen at least once before it disappeared. It was a completely all-encompassing experience that I will all remember."
"The CGI, landscapes, action sequences are all absolutely breathtaking. If CGI was anything like that of say MCU or DC movies, Avatar-2 would have been just a 5/10 movie. That's how good the CGI looks. But the drama, story, dialogues are, at best, average.The movie could have been easily an 8 or 8.5/10 if the climax was bigger and more engaging. I presume, James Cameroon has held back the big things for the 3rd part. But that's the biggest letdown for this movie as the climax here seems very small, in scale and impact, compared to part 1's.James Cameroon knows how to push the emotional buttons of his audience. For example, no matter how badly people badmouth Titanic, the movie haunts us long after watching it. Avatar-1 too, to a lesser extent, managed to evoke some cathartic emotions in us. But in Way of Water, everything falls flat. I was not emotionally invested at any point. Only that I was wowed by beautiful landscapes and mesmerizing underwater shots. When someone dies, it doesn't hit us at all; when someone wins, it makes us only a little joyous; when someone survives, we don't feel relieved and so on.Despite all that, I was glad I watched it. Because Avatar-2's big screen experience was pretty good and should not be missed.PS: I found IMAX 3d to be not worth it. If I had an option, I would have just watched it on IMAX 2d as 3d makes the screen feel smaller than it actually is, thus somewhat ruining the big screen experience."
"Before you complain about why I didnt give 10, I must say that the first one wasn't really my cup of tea, so I watched this with a worse expextation than necessary.But after the first act which sadly was as expected, things really start to get interesting, and James Cameron -again- starts to capture some of the most beautiful shots of cinema i've seen in my life. The second act fully pays for the first 30 minutes which were really not that interesting, and if the movie just ended there without really having a plot, I would actually say it's dammn near perfect, but then there's the third act, which sadly falls back into old action-movie habits. Which just leads to a giant CGI-everythinggoesboom-finale, and an unsarisfying ending.An okay-ish first act
A perfect second act
And sadly a generic finale."
"Unfortunately, the sequel was already weaker for me. The first part had a lot of flair for me in all respects. It was something completely new for me and nice to watch and that applies here as well of course. It definitely does, but it doesn't apply as much for me anymore, because the water world, while not bad, doesn't hold a candle to Pandora, which I certainly enjoyed more. I also liked more of the characters because the previous episode was mainly Jake and Neytiri and here they added the kids and they didn't really grab me, or at least not nearly as much as the previous aforementioned pair. Other than that, I enjoyed in the first one how she was Pandora at times and Jake as a person at times, which is no longer the case here. The action was cool, but again I have to mention the previous episode where in my opinion it was better. What didn't please me was the music, because unfortunately it was the same in places and that just reminded me of scenes from the first one, which I liked better. The same music is probably the worst thing about this movie for me because even though some parts were visually nice, they didn't impress me as much because of the music, which was the same. I'm constantly comparing the second movie to the first, but unfortunately I can't help it. The first one won me over, but the second one didn't. I'm not saying it was a bad movie. But unfortunately it appealed to me much, much less than its predecessor. However, it's still nice to look at visually and still offers some good action sequences. For me, a good movie to recommend and maybe even grab you if you love the underwater world and water in general. Personally though, I prefer 2009's Pandora, which charmed me and more importantly it was definitely easier to get the viewer's attention back then as it was something new and came with 3D for the first time. The second one had a harder time and wasn't as successful in my eyes as the first one."
"Were excited initially but after watching it, to come out of boredom , Had to watch Avatar 1 again !!Way of water Looks pretty but captivating it is not.1. Script was missing. Story was a drag.2. Fascination of the commander with Jack Sully. This was the most awful though to bring down the whole movie from 10 stars to less than three stars. If there had a slightly less predictable story line or any attempt at making the characters have depth and charisma this movie could of been something for me. But it didn't and therefore makes the 3 hours drag on and on.3. Over hyped 13 years waiting and a story that could of been covered in an hour. Good that I didn't watch in premier Theaters (Saved some money)
4. There will be another Avatar next, again with the same lame story of fascination of commander with Jack and both their kids would join their fathers as well . It is easily predictable how movie ended and its a Cliché !!"
"It's extraordinarily hard to make a good sequel, especially with such big shoes to fill compared to Avatar (2009). My rating may be skewed by all the hype I had, but this movie had so many problems in terms of storyline. It's a very pretty movie to look at (always James Cameron's strength). However, excessive plot holes ruined the immersion for me. I enjoyed the beginning of this film, when it felt like it was going to be a guerilla-war against the Sky People, but it quickly changed tack.1. Resurrecting Quaritch was a mistake.He was a good villain, but had a very conclusive and satisfying death in the first film. His resurrection, inserting a son, taming an ikran etc seemed very forced instead of part of a continous story. Also creates the impression they're not bothered coming up with a new villain.2. Jake & family leaving the Omaticaya was rather inexplicable.An entire movie establishing rapport, how he'd fight and die for them, then being entrusted as their leader... to just leave?? I get they wanted to lead the plot to the sea, so was forgivable at the time.3. HOW MANY TIMES WERE THE CHILDREN RESCUED??Perhaps I'm just a jaded old guy now, and these films biggest market is children, but it doesn't have to turn into a cartoon. If I could sum up the plot of this movie it'd be ""1-3 children get captured then rescued over and over for 3hrs"". At one point the kid said ""I can't believe I'm tied up again!"".. me too kid, me too.4. The final battle
Minor one here. Did you notice in the final battle, there were a HUNDRED or so Na'avi attacking the hovercraft, who all inexplicably disappeared after 5 minutes until it was just Jake and his family fighting the humans?? Painfully stuck out for me.5. Death of the son
What was meant to be an emotional death scene really didn't hit because I barely even knew the character (what was his name again?). In 3hrs he has maybe three scenes? Have to hand it to Zoe Zaldana though, her acting here really carried it.6. Kiri's immaculate conception, and special connection to Eywa never lead anywhere? In 3hrs? She has a seizure at one point? I love Sigourney Weaver but she can't voice a child.The theme of deep connection to nature, Jake's hero's journey, the epic battle with tragic character deaths, all of that was non-existent in this movie.Great to look at, and I'm sure many children will enjoy it, just god help the parents who have to sit through this 3-hour cartoon."
"Avatar 2 is a movie with some out standing cinematography, Lighting effects, CGI Works, technically the movie creates a new wonder, full credits to James Cameron team, the screenplay was a bit slow in first half, All the characters who played in first part were utilized without breaking the continuity, addition of new characters also had equal importance with other roles, the second has some action packed scenes, which is treat in 3D images, some emotional scenes were good at times the gigantic whale steals the show, lots of new underwater creatures was good to see, the 3D images were realistic which immerses the viewer to be under the water along with Navis, James Cameron rocks again."
"On a whim, my family decided to see a movie today and, given the dearth of theater worthy films, Avatar was the obvious choice. I have been very disappointed with movies in the last several years because escapism, a primary element in fantasy storytelling, has played second fiddle to the ever-present modern political tropes which mire us in the troubles of the day. On the contrary, Avatar: The Way of Water was pure escapism, in the truest sense of the word. The world Cameron has built looks alien, but feels real in the way we might wish a parallel universe to our own existed. The creatures and people of Pandora are familiar enough to resonate with our expectations but just different enough (better perhaps?) to make the audience long to explore this beautiful world in detail.Just like most reviews I have read, I found that the three hour plus run time was hardly enough. Cameron probably cut out a lot because there were few moments that felt unnecessary to the film. Something else that came as a surprise to me, given Cameron's preference for showcasing powerful female leads, which were prominent in this film as well, I would argue a primary theme was about the relationship between fathers and sons. I think too often these days we don't see masculinity handled in a nuanced way, but you see the spectrum of it in this film. From the destructive elements of struggle and war to the redemptive elements of strength and responsibility, the way Cameron depicted the bonds between fathers and sons was compelling, particularly as I have kids as well.Was everything perfect? Of course not. The motivations of the ""Sky-People"" made less sense than the search for ""Unobtainium,"" and the character tropes were a bit stale. The villains had a bit of a Jurassic World vibe, that was played out so badly in those films I almost walked out, but I could give Avatar a pass on because of all of the positives onscreen.I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film, and the 3-D version was amazing and worth every penny. If you are reading this review, go see this movie in the theater, you will not be disappointed. Let's get James Cameron paid well enough so we don't have to wait another 13 years for the next glimpse into this beautiful world."
"Just left the cinema, and wow. I have no words. This movie, hands down, has the most incredible visuals. I felt immersed in the surroundings, and not just because I went to watch it in 3D.The story is great and keeps you interested, the acting was so passionate it really made the whole film come alive.I have to give credit to the main actors that reprised their roles for this movie. They honestly did such an incredible job. The new characters as well brought something different that again made it really enjoyable.This movie, just like the first one did in 2009, will have you leaving the cinema in awe."
James Cameron has returned 13 years later with a movie which will put all Marvel and Star Wars movies to shame.This sequel improves on the first one in every possible way. The characters are more emotionally resonant and the world building is even more gorgeous. The final act of this movie is Cameron at the peak of his filmmaking powers reminding us all why he is indeed the king of the world. The film also deals with the real world problems of illegal whaling and what it's doing to our oceans without being too preachy about it.An incredible movie going experience which deserves to be seen on the biggest screen possible in 3D.
"Here's the thig, I never come on here to write reviews, but I just had to for this gem. Don't listen to anyone who rated this below an 8. This movie is phenomenal. It has everything you could ever want in a film - heart, story, love, you name it. Yes, it was visually stunning, but the film also shines with the amount of character development it has, as well as the lore and the relationships between all of the characters. I am probably going to watch this again... very soon!!!!!!James Cameron knows how to take you on one hell of a ride!!!!!!!!An amazing follow-up to the first one.Wow.Just.Wow."
"The first Avatar was a masterpiece. The storyline, the CGI, the actors, everything was top rate and it deserved to praise it got.So if you want to know what this movie is about - without actually watching it - just re-run the story with the same good guys and the same bad guys (yep, even the dead ones) and move everything to the ocean instead of the jungle ... and bingo ... there you have Avatar: The Way of Water.It is not a bad movie, in fact it's pretty good, especially the Aussie accents of some of the whalers. It's just not ORIGINAL.Worth seeing on a discount ticket if only for the special effects."
"Six stars felt far too generous so went down to 5.Visually, Avatar impresses of course. Though it's hard to top what the original brought to visual effects more than a decade back so the ""wow"" factor is no longer there and CGI won't float the boat alone (I saw it in 2D so maybe the 3D packs more punch). It brings nothing new now, other than vivid colours.The storyline is the absolute letdown though. Not sure what I was expecting, other than having reasonably low expectations - this is Hollywood, so cheese and predictability are given afterall.But even then, it fails. The characters and scenes were transparent copies of ones we all know; idealistic village scenes, rites of passage, suspicious natives, city kids homesick on arrival in the countryside, grumpy kids and cliched family bonding, whale hunters persuing poor defenseless creatures, native Americans on horseback fighting against colonists, damsels-in-destress tied to the railway tracks...even the ""village scene"" from Platoon and Capt. Willard emerging from the Nung River to take out Col. Kurtz thrown in for good measure.And like every a good (bad?) action film, you can expect it to follow a tried and proven form. All but one of the hundreds of bullets sprayed by the ""bad-guys"" will miss its target, while arrows from our blue heroes are guaranteed to hit every time. It's a very predictable good-guys v bad-guys battle, relying on perfectly timed coincidences and sequences of events, limited nuance or surprise, plus a few mildly sad moments to give the impression the conclusion isn't clear-cut (when it pretty obviously is). All tied up in a way that leaves no doubt an Avatar III, and probaby many more after that, are on their way. All aboard! The money-making express is departing the station.Ultimately its a kid's film, with enough eye-candy to prevent most adults from falling asleep. But in the same way anyone old enough to have watched Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back will likely have been initially wowed, only to be stung by a string of abysmal sequels, Avatar feels headed in the same direction. It is simply weak. Boring characters, cringeworthy attempts at portraying ritual and culture, annoying kids, with a script and storyline written by a recently hired intern.Still, there is a way to make it more bearable. Be sure to take a bottle of your favourite tipple with you to the cinema and the rules are simple: down a drink every time one of the characters shouts ""Go!"" (with ""Go! Go! Go!"" resulting in triple drinks, etc)...guaranteed you'll be drunk as a skunk pretty quickly once the action heats up....such is the depth of script."
"Honestly, the plot is very much as the first part. Rather the movie is shot more consciously & lengthy. Just as all the beings in the first part believe in spirituality of forest is replaced by sea this time. VFX are like God level. The whole series is planned for 5 parts. I expect rest 3 parts to be plotted in different worlds.This series is not just an entertainment, it also conveys a message of divine nature relations with our day to day life. If we observe carefully, it teaches us how to protect & live with our environment, as we loosing our interactions with the spirit of nature in the technology booming world. That's why movie named 'Avatar'
Avatar is a Sanskrit word which doesn't have an exact translation into English. The best I came up with is Shapeshifting or Transforming just as Jake Sully turns into Toruk Makto. Or Avatar also means Incarnation or Descent.🙏"
"All there is to take away from The Way of Water is the fact that James Cameron cares so little about a story for an Avatar movie and likes to blow that insane budget on mindblowing special effects that are supposed to rivet you by themselves. He expects you to be so invested in the beauty of the 3D fantasy world of Pandora, that you're supposed to forget about the elements that really matter; story, compelling characters, good dialogue and entertainment value. The 2021 sci-fi epic Dune had the exact same problem, but it felt like that movie cared more about the audience than the long-awaited sequel to Avatar does.Film and TV reviews are always meant to give credit to where it's due in the movie or series, so we'll start by stating the obvious/the thing you've heard a trillion times by the time of seeing this review, but the budget of over $300 million dollars is put to some good technical use by delivering an immersive 3D experience that viewers hungry for stunning visuals will enjoy Avatar: The Way of Water for. 13 years have passed and technology has obviously improved a lot since 2009, so the cinematography, special effects and picture quality are more advanced, and watch this film in 3D is an absolute hallucination. The fantastical creatures, underwater sequences, humanoid aliens, colours and action deliver the same effect as the first film, making you ask what's CGI, what's shot in real life and how this is all possible.However, this movie thinks it can crawl away from criticism if it's able to impress us with the visual effects, even if it's lacking of elements that are much more simple, though much more important. The story consists around daily events as Jake Sully has now had a family with Neytiri, and a lot of the film focuses on their parenting or the kids getting themselves into trouble. There is no connection at all to the problems the characters must face, the characters themselves, or the uninteresting fantasy world we're supposed to care about. Therefore, this film is extremely boring, unoriginal, predictable and messy. Unless special effects are enough to impress you, Avatar or movies like it don't deserve your money, time or support, and you should shouldn't be afraid to skip it in a heartbeat.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews."
"It's 2022, and let's be honest, ""it's all been done before"". It's damn near impossible to be completely original, and Avatar: The Way of Water certainly isn't... That being said, James Cameron and crew manage to overcome a rehashed story with mind-blowing production values, next-level CGI, (the underwater scenes will amaze you) terrific actors, and an engaging screenplay. There's something for everyone here, and, surprisingly for a 3-hour film... Few ""dead spots"". (my wife, a movie napper if there ever was one, was engaged throughout, and never even went to the restroom!) If you like action, go see it... If you like emotion & drama, go see it... If you're tired of being inundated with messages about ""mother nature"", and how mankind is mucking it up... Stay away, (There are scenes of ""whaling"" that drive that message home, HARD, maybe a little too hard for young viewers). If I could describe the film in two words: ""Beautiful"", and ""Emotional"". (Dave: 53 year-old reviewer)"
"I went to see Avatar 2 expecting a rehash of the first film, but was surprised at how much depth was added.There are certainly some similarities, but I feel like this was meant as a stepping stone to the future instalments of the franchise whilst giving us a great experience. The Sky People have returned and seem like they're here to stay.It's easily the best film I've seen in IMAX 3D, and the best use of 3D technology I've ever witnessed.After waiting over a decade I didn't think it would captivate me as much as it did, but the sheer beauty of it all, along with a nicely fleshed out plot, has made me eager for more.I disagree with a lot of the reviews on here about a lack of plot and poor script, completely unfounded in my opinion. For a 3+ hour film I didn't once find myself getting bored or hoping for it to end.I know it won't win best picture but it deserves a couple of Oscars at least for sound and visual effects.Highly recommend seeing this film at the cinema, and just appreciate how visually stunning it is!"
"In this day and age, a technical masterpiece that looks beautiful isn't really a big deal, so a movie needs a good story. This one does not. In fact, it's a really bad story that is boring from the start. We should have left after ten minutes but unfortunately did not. It looks great and sounds great, especially when the water part comes in. That was interesting for about ten minutes or so but after the exploration of the new scenery, it seemed like it was even more annoying. Online streaming companies do a much better job with teenage drama so Disney should leave it to them. I don't want to pay for an epic journey and wind up watching a bunch of whiny brats."
"Cameron should be embarrassed by this dud of a follow up. I absolutely loved Avatar and have watched it many times. This one I'll never watch again. It's way too long, the story is fraught with a silly plot and the characters ridiculously shallow. The only reason it gets a 4 is the 3D. It is realistic and dramatic but without 3D I would have walked out of the movie. It was that bad and I mean B A D bad. The high ratings here are puzzling. Must be super fanbois because the movie is an epic failure. I had no reservations about paying a high price to see this movie in 4DX but it was so bad I'll likely not even go see Avatar 3 in the theater. Bottom line, the movie sucks."
"I didn't watch the first Avatar movie and was therefore very eager to see the second Avatar movie in theaters. But unfortunately the movie turned out to be pretty bad and inconsequential. The worst part was the terrible writing in this movie which contains many cheesy, lines and superficial, childish dialogue. The unintersting plot didn't justify the movie's three hour duration. I desperately waited for this movie to end. Besides that, the characters were all flat, especially the villain is straight out of a comic book. That would be enough for it to be a bad movie, but no the screenwriters even chose an ending that made the second movie meaningless. The visuals were good but can not make up for the rot that is Avatar. I will definitely not watch any Avatar movie in the future."
"James Cameron promised a visual spectacle and followed through in spades. Avatar: Way of Water is truly magnificent in its world building, and fans of realistic CGI will marvel. But if you're there for a good story you may wind up disappointed.My first beef: bringing back the same antagonist from the first one. A very cheap framing device that smacked of laziness from the writing room.One of the most compelling parts of the first Avatar movie was the pitting of the very distinct (very blue) Na'vi against humans. In this installment the decision to transform the baddies into Na'vii disguise convolutes the action and leaves us startled every time we cut back to actual human-skinned humans, which cycle throughout the narrative.Those are picky production-side weaknesses, which certainly don't torpedo the whole ship, which would be riding higher still if not for that one unintentionally awful comic moment of a subtitled manatee-esque creature carrying on a subtitled conversation with a Na'vi mom about their kids, which nearly skidded the story into farce.Not a waste of a movie ticket, but far from a memorable watch."
"I am writing this review on December 31st 2022.I recall watching the 1st one. It was so boring. My gosh. I heard so much good things about it and I was negatively disappointed because the hype lied to me.Now after many years Avatar 2 has finally released. To be honest I forgot about this movie until I was forced to watch it.If you read my Avatar 1 review. I'm a prolific reviewer. I stated that they took so long with Avatar 2 because the producers didn't expect people to like Avatar 1 because it was boring. Really boring.I wish i got to watch that other hash movie Wakanada Forever instead. Oh well...About: Blue people once again fighting humans aka invaders aka colonizers aka cliche plot.Story and production: The story once again fails to amuse me. It's about the same as Avatar 1. Really boring and too long fillers of nothing.The graphics were good but if the effects and graphics are good but the story is boring then the worthless.This movie was more about showing off the effects than having a worthy well rounded film.Genre: Adventure, WarSound track: Decent mix.Highlight: My favourite colour is blueDo any worthless Mutt appear? No. I can't recall. The boredom must have erased my memory of an ugly dog.Is this movie worthy? No. Now I heard that there will be a lot more of this hash.Should you watch this?: Please don't. It's too boring. It's the same as the 1st but worse because this is the 2nd time that We have to suffer through this hash. 2 is worse than one."
"I went to the theatre alone and watched this film.For me, this film dives into many themes, the crucial difference to its predecessor being FAMILY. Main characters have children. Being able to see the story portray loss & many key elements of what happens within a family, it allowed me to reflect on my own life, my own family, self & future. XThe film was that it is so visually striking, that while you're reflecting, the film is showing you a beautiful connection between man and nature, most sequences are underwater, meditative breathing exercises - you walk away wanting to be a better man."
"If I knew the word bro will be used this many times, I would have had some fun watching the movie while counting the number of times they said the word.Pretty bizarre not gonna lie.Nothing new to add, like most people I was impressed by the visuals, and that's about it.Story was straightforward, simple and... Boring.The most entertaining moment is when a guy's hand gets chopped off.I went to watch it alone, so I had time to reflect in my head. One thing I kept repeating was ""damn that's a lot of details"", complimenting the graphics in 3D.Well, I didn't expect much and didn't get much so I think a 6 is realistic.Thanks."
"As ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" (2022 release; 192 min.) opens, we are reintroduced to Jake, who now has a large family of his own. However it's not long before the sly people show up again in Pandora.... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: After many years of delays, the long awaited sequel from James ""King of the World"" Cameron is FINALLY released. To be honest, it's been so long (13 years) that I don't remember much of the plot of the original Avatar, but I do recall the immersive viewing experience that it was. For this sequel, it seems that Cameron is concerned that a complex storyline might distract us and hence there is very little plot, basically that forest people becoming sea people are GOOD, and that sky people are BAD. Around that paper-thin premise, Cameron builds a visual spectacle that intends to encompass and overwhelm you, and guess what: Cameron succeeds. Along the way, Cameron liberally borrows from Star Wars (the sky people's main vessel is the ocean-equivalent of the Death Star), and from his own Titanic. Is the movie too long? Frankly yes and the initial 60-75 min. Could've/should've been trimmed quite a bit. But in the end, enjoy it for what it is: a visual experience unlike anything you've ever experienced. And did I tell you that forest people becoming sea people are GOOD? And that sky people are BAD?""Avatar: The Way of Water"" opened last weekend. We saw it on Christmas day. The afternoon/early evening XD 3D screening where we saw it at here in Cincinnati was well attended but nowhere near sold out, somewhat to my surprise. IF you saw the original Avatar and enjoyed it, I'd readily suggest you check out this sequel, and draw your own conclusion."
"I would never go to the movie if I knew that it contain scenes similar to the movies about Viet Nam war or videof from current war: tortured villagers and burned village...
Footage of killing the whale mom upfront of her baby is awful , seriously, this movie should have warning.I wish movies are non- violent, we have enough violence in a real life and I don't want to pay to watch more violence.Why we can't have normal, family friendly, happy movie about smart humans, befriending and working together with aliens?!?Why ""would be beautiful"" movie ruined by war scenes and unnecessary cruelty?! Who's dumb idea is that?!"
"Yes and No
Actually, I must appreciate Cammeron for his directing, VFX, CGI, wonderful shots, he brought the real reef into our big screen. Every Scene is a masterpiece, The actors were able to show their performances, he represented new characters, new part of pandora. But where is the plot, where is the Damn story: James, Just I have been waiting 13 years for no story, no plot, Even the battle scenes were not enough like the first one
The Movie is 3 hours and 12 minutes and I still need more, I wish that this will take the place of the best Sci-fi movie in my heart, but it didn't compete avatar. But let us look at the bright side James showed us the meaningful of family, of being father and mother.Jake sully and netyri was so different from the first part because the just interest in their kids, I guarantee you that you gonna cry hard in the movie in sadness and happiness.My rating is 9/10
just because there was no creative in the story it was like another marvel movie.What are you waiting for, go ahead and watch the movie the Imax or in big screen."
"A masterpiece, I stopped going to the movies after Avengers Endgame, as I was finding blockbusters too predictable, with shallow scripts and poorly done CGI.Avatar The Way of Water aroused my curiosity to go to the cinema after hearing about how James Cameron recorded the film and the technologies developed, I went without any expectations and left the cinema dazzled with such a whim I did not see the 3 hours pass, wonderful film, exquisite direction, I'm already looking forward to Avatar 3.James Cameron shines in the direction, stunning scenery, setting and highlight for the battle scenes, which are usually poorly filmed, with many camera cuts and nothing is understood of what is happening, here James shows how to film battle scenes, exquisite !"
"So, after 13 years we finally get a sequel to the 2009 Film after over a decade. I recently saw a Re-Release of the 2009 Film in September.The film picks up some years later when Sam lives his new life, however the Colonel who he thought was dead is now back as an Avatar himself along with a new army & threatens to destroy Sam & his new life. It is then Sam moves his family to the Reef Avatars where they the Forest Avatars learn the way of the water & plan a battle against the Colonel.I found the film to be great. Not as great as the first obviously, but still a great sequel with plenty of dazzling & beautiful visuals as the first. The story is simple which isn't bad at all & a good thing given that films like these nowadays somehow have to be overly complex for the sake of it.The characters are great & the new ones are also a great addition. My complaint with them was that it was hard to tell who was who as they looked too similar & didn't have obvious features in order for me as the viewer to distinguish them. That was annoying.My other complaint is the length & pacing. The film is 3 hours & 3 minutes too long. 30 minutes at the very least could've been exercised. Can't film editors learn about pacing & editing? And they're not the ones who are going to be tested with their attention being stretched to breaking point? Just a thought, keep films consistent, that's all I'm saying.The action & eye candy were pretty good but the last half could've been done a bit sooner, again, an issue brought on with the pacing & editing. But, nonetheless, the film did entertain & entice me for the overly long experience.Overall, it's a great sequel, but not as good as the first film. It has some impressive & dazzling visuals & effects which add & the characters we know & love are as great as the new ones we see. The issues being the distinguishing of the charters & the runtime & pacing which could've been improved, but overall, it's a pretty good sequel. Here's hoping we don't have to wait another 13 years for Avatar 3...7/10."
"Spider is the jar jar binks of this movie , dude literally has no reason to be in this film ! Unless you like lil surfer bro kids , hey bro , hey bro , bro. It's a complete disaster. Some how the memories of some old fart live in a new body , gag me. Oh but hey what's the purpose for the humans to even be there ? Some alien whale sperm. Ohhhh ok , that makes sense. Not mining alien ore now , nah it got to dusty. LoL trash through and through. But go see it and rate it a 10 cause it's pretty. Light you money on fire , at least that will have a good story.....
The science dweebs who stayed around allegedly , are non existent in this movie except to show up randomly in the middle of no where as Life Flight ??? And just as quickly you never see them again. HuH ?"
"It's not just the visuals.It is the story and characters I loved the most.In the first movie I found myself hard to connect and relate to characters.This one I absolutely fell in love with Sully's family, with kids. I felt new appreciation for Pandora.Despite the grand scale the story feels very personal. It's all wrapped in the most phenomenal visual package with action I haven't seen for years.That's why I love and rate this movie a sold 10/10I watched it in IMAX and when the movie finished. Everyone sat quietly in their seats, watching titles and listening to the soundtrack. The feeling I would describe as ""WTF did we just witnessed!"" the sense of awe.Very cool feeling.This is what big screen movie making is about. No wonder this movie is breaking records everywhere.James Cameron Done It... Again!Go and See it on the biggest screen possible. If you'll manage to get a ticket!"
"Sure, the visual and ftx is phenomenal. However, the middle part of the movie is just like a BBC documentary of the arctic without the excitement and depth that BBC is capable of putting into their documentaries.The entire story line is almost perfectly suited for a video game. An example would be Cyberpunk 2077. You switch characters and make videogame-ish decisions, until you reach the final location and beat the final boss. You always know it's going to happen, and as the story progresses you can begin to guess what the finale may be. Cyberpunk 2077 is well made and it's plot has twists and depth, while Avatar 2 seems to have put everything into visuals and nothing for gameplay and story.I am a fan of James Cameron from the Titanic and the Terminator series, so I cannot express my disappointment in this terribly made sequel. I sincerely hope Avatar 2 does not represent the current status quo in Hollywood, for that will be sad for everyone who love entertainment with actual intelligence in it."
"I loved the first one and so I had high hopes for this one as well. Sadly, the pacing was incredibly slow and the movie could have easily been two hours. If this movie was advertised as a real life National Geographic documentary using 8k cameras and crews being allowed an up close view of unknown tribes then sure, the pacing is great. But as an action/sci-fi/fantasy film it was boring enough that I didn't feel bad going to the bathroom. I even asked my daughter, ""What did I miss?"" She said, ""The fish moved some.""Personally, I didn't mind the story. Yes, it's lazy, but I also assume that when you have a five story plan one of them is going to be the ""filler"" that hopefully leads to a more engaging plot. I'm just not sure this one should have been the filler because it doesn't fill me with enough excitement for the next one. At least not enough enthusiasm to see it in a theater."
This show is very good at visual and man the CGI and production show their best in this movie and the actors are surprisingly great but my biggest criticism in this movie is that the character are lack of motives and character development. The character also act dumb and trying to be funny but it's very forceful. The storyline lack of dimensions and explanations this movie show a lot of plots holes and conveniences then the plot armor of the main characters are hilarious its not even funny at that point. For example the ship scene but my biggest take away form this movie is the message they trying to portrayed is very cliche.
"This movie was just plain basic and boring. Something was missing compared to the original, and I don't know exactly what, but I have some contenders.High frame rates *do* in fact make things look more realistic. That also makes them flat and banal. It lookwd more like a soap opera or a home movie than an epic film.There writing was even more basic and bland than the original as well. Unfortunately this time the acting was not enough to elevate the CW quality dialog and story.I feel like this is James Cameron's Phantom Menace. Either he has eliminated anyone in his circle from challenging him, or this movie was made only to sell toys, or both."
Wauw I imagine humans walking out this movie with a feeling that those Navi saved there beautiful nature and won the battle against the humans. Really disgusting how the director exploits the exploitation of our own beautiful planet with this eco porn.Why not make a feelgood Avatar without any human polution. And it is all a rip off of the beautiful Aquableu Comic by Cailletau and Vatine. Blue people the same robot walkers and storyline.I agree fully that the colors and creatures are pretty nice and the parts were you see the Navi interact with nature is created with a lot of inspiration. But the last our I had to walk away.
"Worth for the visual, sound and effects but a very disappointing story and movie, other point is that the duration is too long without be necessary several parts that not added anything for the history could be removed without cause any.problem for the Final Cut of the movie.I was not expecting too much to be honest but it offers less than I expect.Some parts of the history are pure invention and not linked, so o guess is a typical movie that is 100% baes in a visuals only, I would be happy to watch it in Netflix or HBO Max.In my opinion does not worth the cost and time I spent in the movie theater 😊"
"It is impossible not to be utterly swept away by the beauty and majesty of this film.Visually it is stunning. Taking the series to the ocean is such an inspired choice which led to the creation of so many stunning sequences and visuals. From this perspective the film cannot be faulted at all. I'm a big 3D sceptic but this film really does benefit from the technology, particularly the underwater scenes which are just gorgeous.The action set pieces are exceptionally well done. The final act in particular is breathtakingly thrilling and will have you on the edge of your seat. Everything about the action just feels epic.Speaking of epic, Cameron builds out the mythology and history of Pandora, introducing new Na'vi cultures and creatures which is such a treat. You can tell a lot of care has gone into crafting this world and it is reflected on screen as we are given such a rich and well developed experience.What Cameron also does very well is to capture this epic scale while managing to make such an emotional film. Focusing the film on Jake's family led to some truly beautiful moments and really grounded the film, so get ready for an emotional ride.The weak point of this film is definitely the story. It is a fairly straightforward tale of revenge and family, and contains a few narrative missteps that should have been avoided. Some of the dialogue feels a little cringe and cliche, and the story lacks drive and propulsion in its middle third.However, the middle third is perhaps the most beautiful part of the film. The world of Pandora is so majestic, so rich, so well crafted, that I didn't care that the story felt static. I was happy just to be there.I sincerely hope that film gets the love it deserves and Cameron is able to fully realise his vision across multiple films. He has created a special formula here and I for one can't wait for part three, and hopefully many more after that."
"Simple story, animation is good but in over quantity but happy to see emotions of a family that cares for one another. Overall you can watch the movie in theatres only 1 time watch. First 20minutes of the movie is great, rest is boring till interval. After interval the story takes pace and start getting your interest. Fight scenes are amazing, spirit sisters are also amazing with their high valued strengths that comes very handy for the Avatars in big fight. If you are looking for a great story, then it is a waste. If you are going as a fan you will enjoy this movie. Overall average for me. Zzz !!"
"Violent, loud, noxious, dull characters lacking empathy or depth.The only revealed truth is what anyone who has been swallowed up by the ocean knows, -relax and slow your heart down until the wave spits you back.Other than that, the banal dialogue and ½ dimensional Marvel comic book characters are laughable. The interesting character, who we might root for in the hope of his developing enough grit (like BG Smedley Butler, USMC : ""War is a Racket"") to show any semblance to human complexity, remains a rigid poster board cutout bad-guy (OK, he saves his own ""son."")The beginning trinity of births, virgin or artificial, is beyond all credulity: an alien Colonel from a chip, a Pandora daughter from the dead womb of Sigourney Weaver, and the spontaneous generation of monkey boy Spider. This 3-some matches the 3-diabolical-corporate goals: gravity defying rocks, terraforming a poisonous planet (moon?) or draining whale brains for immortality. ""A foolish consistency,"" methinks is also the ""hobgoblin"" of mediocre films, buoyed only by imaginative graphics ""full of sound & fury."""
"A disturbing, depressing, anticlimactic, unsatisfying dud of a film plot. God I wanted to like this movie so much and truly hated it. You can't replace an actual plot with visuals alone. It doesn't work. And bringing the old villain back to life? Seriously? This barely there film plot felt like a 3-hour advertisement for the next Avatar movie. Worse, it made the plight of the Na'vi seem hopeless, which makes me not want to watch the next one at all. Why invest in characters that get no justice and are going to be annihilated by the villainous sky people? Such a disappointment of a movie. I came away feeling so emotionally let down and frustrated."
"Omg what an experience of a movie. One of the best 3d movie i have ever witnessed one of the best. The fps and the move throughout the film which is so amazing. I just lived under the water. The FPS tat was the best. The story and screenplay was equally good too, usual one but a good one. The experience gotto the theaters in 3d the best experience ever. The movie was moving in a butter path. That much smooth. Sam zoe and kiri everyone played their role to the best, pretty emotional connecting and the action sequeneces were mind blowing. Dont miss to watch this movie in theater tat too dont miss in 3d and imax will be better. An osm osm experience. Please do watch it in theaters. The end was a bit slow but it can be negleted. Every character has some part to play which was amazing."
"This movie is bad. It feels like a film which has no idea what it is, carelessly assembled from individual scenes that add very little to one another. Take each piece of the quilt on its own and they are not bad, some are even good. Taken as a whole you will find yourself asking the same question repeatedly: Why do I care? At many points it is obvious how James is trying to advance the story, you can see and understand the reasoning behind decisions. It is done so clumsily, though, that you are never engaged in a well crafted story, you just see the component parts of an attempt at one.As far as spectacle goes, this film has plenty. You can tell they spent a quarter of a billion on it. By the time three hours is up the novelty will have worn off."
"I am not a family man but this movie might be cool for a family movie ? IdkThis movie is boring and tbh I never found the first one nice but at least the first one was new experience with 3D and that's it.30 mins in and I started yawning, 45 mins in and I left. There is no story, action is boring, CGI is a trip to the 2012s nothing impressive. Script is weird and feels like someone who is trying to fit in with the young gen wrote it. Not a fan of James Cameron overall, other than titanic I see him as an average director. I wouldn't recommend this movie at all even if you are looking to burn some time.This movie will succeed in the cineme off the hype of the first one, but a third part won't go anywhere. Nice try James, boring execution."
"Avatar: The Way of Water is a movie that has been delayed repeatedly, doomed to fail - especially according to Twitter users and oldheads. It finally released not too long ago and I have watched it twice since, and this film definitely has its' positives and negatives.The main glue holding this series together is Pandora's world and the visual effects are absolutely out of this world! The final act is an absolute spectacle and a magnificent show of James Cameron's insane talent when it comes to action sequences, this is where you start to get to this film's faults:
There's no plot keeping you invested, the first act is average and doesn't do a good enough job of establishing the vast potential this world could order, the dialogue is so, so, so overwhelmingly cringe at times (and I don't use that word lightly) with words like bro and cous being used every second word, like Cameron was trying to appeal to a mass audience but failed miserably. One performance in particular stood out to me as remarkably effortless - and not in a good way - and this is the kid who plays Spider, I don't know what they were thinking with his character but it's like they were trying to make him investing, whilst he is the most uninteresting character I think I have ever seen in a Cameron film.In working for this film for so long, I am not 100% sure but maybe around 13 years of incredible effort by the visual effects and editing team (including James Cameron himself) Cameron may fail to realise this comes at the cost of lackluster story and dialogue. This movie is not bad overall, there is a lot going for it, the action scenes are incredibly shot and the world of Pandora is absolutely beautiful, but once again outside of that there is not much to grasp your true attention. (6.5/10)(Something quick I forgot to mention, the message of protecting our oceans is delivered in a much less forced way the first one did with protecting our forest, it is also really beautiful, so yeah, James Cameron seems really passionate about this topic and I think that's pretty cool.)"
"I was really pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this film.Technically, this is a masterpiece. I have literally never seen digital effects that are this convincing and the 3D here outdoes the incredible 3D in the first film. Cameron also seems to have cracked how to use high frame rate footage to enhance action sequences without hurting the rest of the film. It's an astonishing piece of work that really does need to be seen in the theater.From a story and character perspective, this is better than ""Avatar"", but not great. Cameron has a more compelling and multi-layered plot here, and I frequently admired his commitment to old fashioned adventure, but really ... there's not enough here to warrant the really punishingly long runtime. Especially during the climax where it just seemed to refuse to end, I became a bit fed up and wanted out of Cameron's world long before he was prepared to let me go.But ... I enjoyed this and will show up for more of these."
"Colossal disappointment here. I can't believe a 3.2 hour movie had such dull and puerile dialogue. The middle hour of whales and teenage dullards had me wanting to open a book till it was over. He still does the action stuff brilliantly but the finale was strangely lacklustre. The music was cliched and the noble savage sentimentality was grating. Overall worst was the teenagers ""bro"". The convoluted heavy lifting of the exposition to get the returning characters back was weird and clumsy.Is he going to see out the rest of his career making these bloated cartoons? SadI should say I saw it in an IMAX, it looked OK but Dune did far more imaginative stuff creating an alien world."
"We all know that visually it was always going to be stunning. But the story was so so poor and, farcical and implausible that everytime we moved on to a new scene it made you think that the original movie didn't exist ! The Colonel died but low and behold he is an avatar And wow he has a son, really ??Grace''s avatar, which was DEAD is for some reason dragged back to the cryo tube, ALIVE. THEN gives birth to the immaculate conception !!!!! Just NONSENSE.How in the hell did the stupidly named UNOBTAINIUM be superseded by the absurd notion that the fountain of youth is in the 4 eyed whales brain they somehow discovered. It defies belief. Graces daughter( Jesus of Navii) shows abilities akin to a prophet.An underwater tree of knowledge.The Colonels team master abilities that took Jake ages to master.The Colonel gets CHOKED OUT deep underwater then defies logic and rescued by his son. The same son who turned informer on the Navi and was somehow welcomed back. And where did the water tribe go after the attack ?Jakes family master holding there breath in days.Jakes son saved by an outcast whale ffs.Jakes kids display ZERO discipline and are the very reason for ALL trouble experienced in the entire 3 hour movie !!!Perhaps I was expecting somehow that the story would evolve but for me the warning signs were raised when I heard Weaver and the Colonel were returning. The ending was predictably embarrassing. The villain survives to fight another day to appear with his miraculous monkey and Jesus of Navi and Jake and his brats. Soapy cliched cringeworthy fanservice worthy of being a family friendly animated special not worthy of a James Cameron movie. Bling over substance. Without the incredible 3D effects it is pretty lame. The story of the 3rd film has been laid bare. And to think they are doing 5.. yawn."
"I came into this movie expecting to be blown away by the CGI but also find a shallow story, similarly to the first Avatar.And that's exactly what I found. The visuals in this movie are breathtaking , I would also like to give special mention to the musical composition which doesn't seem to get enough credit. A big chunk of the movie has no dialogue and feels like a nature documentary , the great composition really brightens up these scenes. I feel very happy that I got to enjoy this movie in an empty theater , where it truly shines.However , similarly to the first movie, the characters , dialogue and plot are pretty shallow and not very exciting.To anyone that is looking to watch this movie, I would say manage your expectations and you won't be disappointed."
"The plot itself is pretty basic, what you think will happen generally did end up happening. I would have liked to see some plot twists. I also would have liked to see more main characters actually die as the stakes were never really that high (It was clear Jake Sully and his wife were never in any real danger). The acting was passable. Where this movie shines however is the animation and visuals. Last movie excelled with the amazing sky visuals. This movie excels with spectacular underwater visuals. The movie also helps visualize the vast scope of the planet.Additionally I felt like the runtime for this movie was super long. Felt like I was watching for ages.Overall I would recommend watching this movie once in theaters."
"This is quite literally the same movie, expect that it's under water. I don't understand why the Avatar movies are so highly rated on IMDB, after all the movies are unmemorable, characters are bland and unmemorable. Just like with the first Avatar movie.I will concede that the film has great visual effects, but the visuals don't elevate any great emotion or inquiry from the viewer, like they would in an Tarkowsky film for eksample, Avatar is not that which i think is wasted potential, James Cameron could have used Avatar to ask profound questions regarding nature and metaphiscs through Pandora."
"The story has more depth than the last one and you'll find yourself caring more deeply about characters from above and below water. It's primarily about family and that's fine. I enjoyed it, I'm not sure how they can continue this for another three films but knowing James Cameron he's already thought of that and is way ahead of the game.For me the visuals here are just insane, you'll forget you're watching mostly CGI, it looks so real it's mind boggling. For some easy cash bet big on this in any visual effects category, your money is safe. Marvel and Disney will watch this and realise their VFX need a serious upgrade.My only issue, and it's a small one, take 30 minutes off the running time. There's plenty of places this could've been done. At over 3 hours it's just a bit too long. That's just me :-)"
"I was very uncomfortable at times, partly because the dialogue and the accents of some characters were just shocking, but also because of the frequent 'battle calls' made by some of the characters.The whole thing stands and falls with the 4-5 children the couple now has, and unfortunately you care about exactly none of them. Especially Kiri for some reason I could not stand.This is not a movie for adults, and it is too long for kids to watch. So I'm not sure about the target audience. Maybe 13-16 year olds approximately, if they are patient and not easily bored.Another reviewer said it best: The only thing that you care about in the movie is the poor whale.Visuals are stunning, without that it would have been a solid 1 out of 10."
"I recently watched it in 3D and I have to be honest; it is an unoriginal film that relies utterly on the visual to entertain and amaze. We have in the film a group of blue Rastafarians who have a powerful connection with the environment, making them a kind of anarcho-ecologists. Then the problem arises when progress knocks on the doors of a planet that shouts ""Don't touch me!"" Moby Dick and many more movies. The lack of originality is so obvious that it attacks the viewer. Only a couple of sequences are adequately used to convey some sympathy for the film's heroes. In my case, I expected them to be swept away from the first frame while loudly supported ""Team Human. It could have lasted less but Cameon gloated over the possibility of overwhelming us with his idea of an ideal world. As a show it's decent, as a vehicle for educating the masses it just sucks."
"I was twelve years old when I saw the first film in 2009 and now thirteen years later it was a complete thrill to return to Pandora. I kept myself away from knowing only the basics of the plot and man I'm glad I did. This film is extraordinary! The amount of time spent on this film (and the next film) was worth every minute of waiting thirteen years. I've only given three films 10/10 stars this year and this film deserves it in every way. James Cameron, being the perfectionist he is, delivers a thrilling family centered drama that at the beginning takes you back to Pandora, by the middle makes you want to not be apart of the human species anymore, and then at the end leaves you teary-eyed.The visual effects are unbelievable, and I don't use that word lightly. The high frame rate works in tandem with the uncanny VFX to create a seamless line in making the Na'vi and Metkayina people look incredibly real. And the water itself, I have no idea how Weta was able to make the water that life-like. I mean this film knocks every VFX shot done on film before on it's ass, absolutely incredible. (Sorry Marvel, even though I love your films too).But what really grounds you in this film, although the visuals do that pretty freaking well, is the simple story telling. This film has gotten some flack for its ""basic"" story but in reality when you see the film the story itself is one that every person has lived, childhood and growing up. Every character in this film has a story arc and is well thought out about how each character is used. If I had to tell story of this film I would say it in one word, ""family.""This film is in my top 3 of the year and deserves to be seen on the biggest screen possible, this film is what the movie going experience is all about. It's a fantastic film with story telling points that will hit home and as I said before leave you with tears in your eyes at the very end.In the immortal words of Alfred Hitchcock, ""If it's a good film, the sound could go off and the audience would still have a perfectly clear idea of what was going on."" And that fits this film to a tee."
"I don't know how I feel about the movie after leaving the theater. Some of the visuals are absolutely amazing but some look like a video game cut scene and it gets distracting. The plot is essentially the same as the first film with no additional story and too many characters to really get attached to anyone. It's too long in my opinion, a lot could have been cut from the middle of the film. It's a 3+ hour film and almost 2 hours of it feels like a documentary and just doesn't have the same entertainment factor the first film had. I didn't hate it but I also probably won't watch it again at any point."
"The movie has amazing water vfxs, beautiful underwater scenes and creatures but my it's script is just creatively cheap. They literally copied the script from the first movie and changed jungle for seas. The plot was the same. And that's considering the first movie was a copy paste of Ferngully, so a copy of a copy. It's honestly disappointing how such an expensive movie could not hire decent writers to actually develop a plot and good characters. Some of the acting from the teenagers wasn't that good either. I just hope the next installment isn't just another copy paste but in the savannah or desert because honestly that would be way too much poor writing."
"That's pretty much it, so if you've seen the first movie there's little more I can tell you.I am only writing this review because I cannot believe this movie is averaging an 8.1 rating on IMDB and I have to do something about that.So let's recap: Tall jungle people are at one with nature. Nasty humans come from space and kill all the beautiful animals. (Ooh we hate those nasty humans!) Nasty humans threaten our hero and his loved ones. Looks like our hero is going to meet his end at the hands of the horrible humans. Nature comes to the rescue at the last minute and kills all the nasty humans.Sound familiar? Just add water.I'm sure this is a cinematic spectacle, but so was the first one and it's just too long, predictable and hackneyed and woke to warrant praise. I'm just glad I saw it on a Chinese head cam rip-off on the internet at a friends house.Goodness knows how he's going to stretch this ""story"" out to any more sequels. I certainly won't even bother with the head cam version next time."
"What the heck are other people watching when they review this. It's like watching a 3 hr long video game. Added to that, if you watch it in 3D, you get a headache (bcoz of the visuals - not the rubbish storyline, which is an old-fashioned revenge flick). No way, is this anywhere close to groundbreaking as the 1st movie was or even a Titanic. Most overhyped movie of all time.Repeating the above to fill the minimum character limit - What the heck are other people watching when they review this. It's like watching a 3 hr long video game. Added to that, if you watch it in 3D, you get a headache. :-("
"Visualise this a good movie and pretty much pushes what we can do with today's technology, at present it's the best movie I've seen where the CGI doesn't look clunky.Storyline wise it definitely lacked depth. It was an interesting angle to bring back powered up old villains and introduce a new water clan but it definitely felt like a national geographic feature in parts with the storyline pretty much being look at the pretty animals, mostly for no particular reason. Whilst the film is long by today's standards it didn't feel like a 3 hour movie but you could easily cut an hour and the story wouldn't suffer.Ending felt like a bit of a cop out, would have preferred the sequels to go in a new direction as I felt the next one might suffer from too much repetition."
"The first film was great. This felt long (longer than 3 hours). Several of the decisions made by some of the main characters didn't make much sense, except to push the story in the direction of 'water', as per the title. Great 3D visuals at the cinema, but I'd wait to see this at home, so you can fast forward through all of the fighting. I need to write more so.... In conclusion, this appears to be merely a filler to set the stage for the 3rd film, although that may just be a filler to set the scene for the 4th, which may just be a filler... do you see where I'm going with this? Just skip this and the next films until Cameron makes the last in the series...."
"Avatar: The Way of Water is a cinematic masterpiece, full of powerful emotions, stunning visuals, breathtaking action and fantastic characters.Unlike the first movie, there is not just one main character. The heart of this movie is family. Jake and Neytiri have to face the consequences of their actions, and also have to take some difficult decisions. Their children are all fantastic new characters and each of them is unique in their own way and brings something new to the story. You will love Kiri, Lo'ak, Tuk, Neteyam and Spider.I would recommend watching Avatar: The Way of Water on the biggest screen available. You will not regret it!"
"This film is overrated. The 3D and the visuals are amazing but there is no script. There are a lot of plot holes and everything is left open for a 3 part. Maybe the 3rd one will have some closure. I feel like this is an empty movie just to tell us: ""we improved our technology wait for the rest of it"". I have some characters left but I don't know what else to say maybe the writers did the same with the film they had to fill three hours and they just left the predictive did the work. I am going to leave the machine write the missing characters: the movie was a bit longer than I expected but I was able to find a good time. Done."
"So a good father has a gun in his hands and defends his family? Lying to hide a mistake is what you teach as a father? Don't fight, but if you do, make sure the other guy has more pain?What ethics. Is this what American kids learn?Avatar used to be a spiritual movie. There's nothing left of that in version 2.Sure, the graphics are stunning and overwhelming, but even that gets boring after an hour. Even the average National Geographics documentary has more story than this movie.You would expect they want to convey the message that the planet is worth caring for, collaborating, but all we see is war and money-driven destruction."
"A totally beautiful movie, much more beautiful than the first one and has alot of touching and meaningful moments, love the progress of the family and their adaptive nature....however, this movie also show how evil humanity is, which is horrifying, disturbing and disgraceful..Of course, human earth is dying. It was humanity that cause it yet now they are destroying another planet with all the habitat and beautiful creatures...very disappointing but an eye-opener too.. hopefully we all can learn from this.Hopefully when or if the 3rd movie ever come out, we can see a much beautiful ending where evil humanity back off and scram from there.."
"The movie visually stunning, the final battle started off epic but then quickly become just another boring fight.The core story is empty, the same conflict as Avatar 1. Nothing new. The story is told in a simple straight forward way and the dialogues are simple, very basic. Nothing profound, nothing shock, nothing interesting except the visual. The plot is so boring. He has 13 years, could have refine the dialogue to make it memorable. They reuse alot of ""I See You"" from.the first movie.Without spoilers, I didn't care who lives who dies, I don't invest in the characters much because the story lack depth, hence I couldn't connect.Could have explored the tribes' dynamic, conlficts and introduce the kids in this movie in depth. This would have gave us a brand new conflicts story and allow us to invest in the kid's character.But instead, they repeated the same old story from Avatar one with a bunch of new characters that I don't know enough to care about.In summary, a visual stunning movie with shallow empty plot."
"First time ever writing a review; the visual are stunning as to be expected! But that's as far as it goes; the story was ok, just throughout the entire movie the plot continually undermines itself, characters continually have plot armor except when they don't & it seems the only time they don't is cause Cameron felt like shafting one of the characters, & there were numerous times where the story should of just completely haulted because it was poorly written but they just skip over the gaping plot hole like they expect nobody to notice; they try to give you a sense of mystery that there is something you don't know or understand yet as for why the plot hole happened, but just turns out there was no reason other than that the writers just suck! Again visuals stunning & for that alone was the only reason I didn't walk out, cuz tbh it is really cool to see.....just the story itself 🤢"
"Did I like the first one? . Yes very much, I saw it 3 times at the cinema..... Did I like the second one? It was just OK....Why? It had something missing that was obvious in the first movie... A sense of wonder and the excitement of something new.In Avatar, Jake was excited as a child with all the animals and plants having something special to offer and it came out in his child like attitude as the movie progressed.In The Way of Water, the entire movie was adversarial and because of that it appeared as more of the same.I won't be rushing back to the cinema to see it again as I did with Top Gun Maverick...IMO it was a bit FLAT..."
"Where do I start.. visually it's a marvel. The scenery, character design, and action effects looked lifelike. Seamless interactions with this CGI heavy film. A beautiful film. Awesome.The story? Godawful. Thinner than a single human hair. I mean, it's basically nonexistent. You get a action packed payout at the end but don't expect this to be a well written film. You came for the think blue creatures and the flying lizards.First hour was good. The second hour dragged like
Bernie from Weekend at Bernie's. The third hour was action packed. It was too noticeable to ignore.They could have cut out 80-90 minutes in this film and still have a coherent story. Drink an extra coffee and go to a mid-morning show. Roughly 30-40% of the theater I went to was snoozing. C+."
"I've never seen such a beautiful cinematography and the VFX which is used it's the best of all time I've seen in my whole life
Sometimes it was like a spiritual experience to see the visuals which were so beautiful I can't even compare them with. Overall story is just normal but you're gonna enjoy the movie. But only watch it in 3D. James Cameron is such a beauty when it comes to the direction. Waiting for the next sequel of the movie, this movie can become highest grossing of all time, it has that level of direction work, James Cameron should be given Oscar for the visuals he created for the movie."
"I was absolutley flabbergasted by the CGI effects in the movie, the water scenes in this is the reason the technology was invented in the first place. James Cameron is the filmmaker who understands what CGI was used for and the way it should properly be used. It something that cant be used to replace the practical but instead a tool for something that goes beyond what would be impossible for a practical effect to acheive.He has created a world out of Computer Imagery that feels completley alive and breathing with scenes underwater shot so well and clearly, you can see why he waited all these years to get it right. I can't wait to see what future film learn from this to make underwater scenes feel less and less of a daunting task and look more streamlined and realistic.It also has a great story about the importance of family and overcoming xenophobia and tribalism, aswell as preserving the beauty of the ocean. The water is so nice, you'll forget it's saltwater."
"It opened early here in Thailand Wednesday morning, so Tuesday night for America in Bangkok time, which made it feel special to view it early. The visual effects were next level, like when Terminator 2 first debuted in 1991 compared to the other films at the time. So much detail was included in the design of all the machines, the organic creatures and the backgrounds. Many beautiful shots were included purely for esthetic enjoyment - like the silhouette of holding hands with the whale and the schools of self-luminous fish.The plot of course was more basic, with Disney-style wide appeal elements like the parents saving the children and vice versa, but given the magnitude of the achievement overall, the plot worked fine, and it will allow a wide range of viewers from younger kids to senior citizens to enjoy the magnificent of the cinematographic achievements.Overall, this dwarfed all the other blockbusters this year. A true statement about the joy of life and the wondrous possibilities unfolding with this magic computer world of 2022."
"The true reviews for this film will not be available until it is released on home video. Currently, it is clear that the majority of reviews on IMDB and elsewhere are based on 3D theatrical viewings. However, when viewed in 2D, the film does not impress as much. 3D films tend not to age well, and this one likely will not either. The use of rendered objects thrown at the viewer for the purpose of creating a thrill in a 3D theater loses its effectiveness when viewed at home in 2D. It essentially becomes an expensive screensaver. It is unclear why this film had to cost $400 million. Was it necessary for the Na'vi to be CGI creations? They are similar enough to humans that they could have been achieved through makeup and possibly some CGI enhancements to their eyes. As a result, the film feels like an expensive cartoon, with only one major human character and all other characters being digital aliens. The renderings are polished, but they do not appear photorealistic, particularly when the characters speak. The movement of their mouths reveals their animated nature. It is one thing to have a CGI character in a film, but when every character and environment is animated, the film resembles more of a cartoon like ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"" than a live-action Marvel film.The story, such as it is, could have been told in 45 minutes. The majority of the runtime consists of filler meant to evoke a sense of awe at the beauty of nature. The film does not delve into the darker aspects of nature. It is assumed that life on Pandora evolved through the process of eliminating the weak from the gene pool. Yet there is little depiction of predation on Pandora. The Na'vi and animals live in harmonious coexistence, except for the fact that it is acceptable to kill fish for food but not whales. Characters from the previous film, such as Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), have minimal roles and serve only as one-dimensional cameos. Jake Sully is no longer the main character, replaced by his children. In fact, he has so many children that it is difficult to keep track of them. All of the Na'vi look similar to one another, with the sea people Na'vi being a lighter shade of blue. It is not clear why Jake would choose to have so many children, considering he is living on a world under attack by invaders and would therefore be bringing them into a dangerous situation. It is also unclear why everyone is naked and why Jake, being from Earth, would not have a greater interest in clothing to protect his skin from the sun and the plants and animals on Pandora. The character Monkey Boy (Spider) also raises questions as he walks around without clothes or shoes. The story does not make much sense, as Jake was previously tasked with defending the forest, but he now easily abandons it.As numerous reviews have stated, the film is excessively long. It could easily be edited down to 90 minutes, as much of it is CGI filler. There is no reason to spend such a large sum of money on a film that ultimately feels like a waste. The amount of electricity used in rendering alone is staggering. If you do decide to see the film, it is recommended to view it in 3D. That is what it was meant to be, a demo reel for 3D TVs. 2/5."
"I'm a big Cameron fan but we have some issues with Avatar Way of Water. Apart from the very strange plot points, Jake Sully is a wet blanket for most of the film and Natiri is barely noticeable. In the first film, Sully was in a new world, in a new body, and his timidness was believable in the scenario. In way of the water, he does not present well as the warrior leader of the Na'vi as conveyed by Quarich, rather he is a careful father who is running scared. The dialog is the worst I've heard in a Cameron movie and it comes across as a second thought to the filmmakers, particularly the dialog between the kids.On plot, Humans want to colonize Pandora because apparently ""earth is dying"" however this idea is in the background and never explored any further. We spend the entire movie with the water tribe and are never told what is going on with the rest of the Na'vi and the forest. We also see nothing from earth or the human experience happening there. For a movie that runs almost 4 hours, I was hoping for more.The whales of Pandora contain a serum in their brains that can prevent humans from aging, why? Who knows? But this idea is a one liner and is never explored further in this one. This is a cheap set up to be exploited in subsequent sequels.The anatagonist is again Quarich who is now in Avatar form (which makes little sense, basically a quarich avatar was generated for him and his goons during the time of the first movie and his memories and consciousness is implanted into his and his crews gestating avatars?) and the film is driven by Quarich's lust for revenge against Jake and Mrs Sully. The problem is the characters motivation and his character himself is just not compelling enough. In human form, I could get behind his reasoning as a career military man on a mission for his people in the first installment but his mission here is an entirely personal vendetta, even though he is no longer human. Why did we need to revisit Quarich and his goons as the lead villains, when there is an entire planet of human being characters with motives to populate Pandora? On top of that, Quarich survives this movie so we can expect to see him again. Booooring.There are also some frame rate issues that make the action seem jumpy and took me out of some sequences. This movie was entertaining at times and visually stunning at times, but it's far from great."
"We as a society need to stop lying to ourselves the avatar movies are good.The script and acting are so horrendously bad. It's like eating three salteen crackers without with water. Can confirm, It's actually 3 hours of torture.PLEASE if everyone doesn't go to see this film, they won't have enough money to the make AVATAR 3, AVATAR 4, and AVATAR 5.You're not going to see anything new anyway, just watch the first Avatar if you can sit through it now-a-days.The first movie was good when it first came out, compared to many films it had a lot backing it up. It was a pioneer for 3D, but you take away the 3D and it doesn't hold up in modern times."
"I committed the ""mistake"" of watching Avatar I the day before watching it in the cinema. It's a habit I have, whenever a sequel is released, I usually watch the prequels (e.g: LotR, Matrix) to have all the plot and story fresh. What is my surprise, after long time awaiting this movie, that is basically a re-worked watered environment with kids version of Avatar I. It's THE SAME plot, ffs even the main villain is the same one, they did not break their head with it. CGI effects are great as usual, even though 3D was nothing special from my point of view.. The overall path was extremely slow, boring, I was so close to fall asleep in many occasions. It's predictable and all the little drama around the kids is just unsufferable. Seriously, Avatar I was somehow an adult story (is a adaptation of Pocahontas in the end), but Avatar II, it's like the version for 6yo kids of Avatar I."
"The movie itself definitely lacked any real storyline... basically just going back for revenge on Jake Sully and then they added what they were after on Pandora (a different substance compared to the first movie) and it feels like they went over that pretty quickly. The CGI and visuals were absolutely amazing but in all honesty, the movie could have gotten to the point and be at least an hour shorter on its actual runtime. After 30 minutes, the next 90 minutes could have been squeezed into 30 minutes and you would have still gotten the same effect. Fairly disappointing movie overall and didn't live up to the hype. Hopefully they do a much better job with the 3rd instalment of the franchise."
"Kudos to JAMES CAMERON for providing us magical experience of 190 minutes of amazing visuals and great story telling.Set more than a decade after the events of the first film, ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" begins to tell the story of the Sully family (Jake, Neytiri, and their kids), the trouble that follows them, the lengths they go to keep each other safe, the battles they fight to stay alive, and the tragedies they endureEach character has weight in it and more than 10 years of hard work from all the technicians and actors can easily be seen throughout the movie.I can't wait to see Avatar3,4,5 coming up in next few years, I'm glad that most of the filming is finished for upcoming sequels.DO WATCH IT IN IMAX 3D FOR BEST EXPERIENCE."
"The story may be simplistic on a narrative level, but it is on an emotional (and visual) level that ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" shines. This is a film about the importance of family, and how fighting together can solve problemsIt truly was an astonishing cinematic experience I won't soon forget
Features some of the most incredible spectacle ever created by the absolute master of precise parallel action... The only thing more astonishing than anything in The Way of Water is that Cameron will probably, somehow, top itWatching this on IMAX 3D is truly a spectacular big-screen experienceJames Cameron does it again giving you a visual masterpiece that surpasses the first film."
"Both this one and its predecessor, are really inspired by the saga of Cowboys and Indians. The Indians being 'sons of the soil' nature lovers. The cowboys being the invaders.This story is the same as the previous one with the 'newness' coming the new setting in the Ocean. You'd be forgiven to think that you are maybe watching a documentary on Discovery channel half the time. Apparently James C's idea is to provide a sense of wonder with new flora and fauna to compensate for the lack of originality in script or characters. Frankly its boring.Only those who go to movies for the animation and visuals will appreciate this. If you care about original screenplay or interesting characters, look somewhere else. Basically you feel like such film makers cheat audiences by creating formulaic movies to line up their pockets. It's a rehash of a rehash."
"Ok, this movie really isn't good. I was super bored the entire time, none of the characters were interesting or intriguing, the plot was a huge retread of the original, and even the visuals (minus the backgrounds) were a giant eye sore. Watching these weird, stretchy looking blue Ice Age babies do hyper realistic yet wholly unsettling and uncanny facial expressions while constantly calling each other ""bro"" was just super hilarious to me. The other thing that had me constantly scratching my scalp was the lack of context with jungle boy's origin. Or how Sigourney Weaver had a child. Or better yet, why Sigourney Weaver was playing a teenager? I'm scared that there's going to be 3, count 'em people, THREE more of these things.Good lord.D-"
"It's a repeated narrative, nothing much new to offer. If you're content with some visuals you'll enjoy it, but even they didn't offer much. It could be watched in 2D and have the same impact. The same can't be said for the first one. New characters were boring. Our protagonist is preoccupied in keeping his children in tow. If only the children were actually interesting. Whales can communicate, but the acting is so poor, you don't care about any connection they have. They had the chance to explore a new culture, but the culture was practically the same, just in water. There could have been so much to explore with the protagonist, yet it seemed focused on the kids and the water effects, it just didn't hold up. The women were portrayed as weak and emotional. It hints on racism, but the kids weren't interesting enough to hold your attention on the matter. I went to watch a movie with characters I enjoyed previously, instead I was met with new ones I had zero interest in. Kiri seemed to talk like her mother, yet she didn't raise her. Her story with her connection to Eywa wasn't explored enough for you to care. It was way too long considering there was little substance. Seemed rushed considering it took 13 years to make. Third one? Not interested, frankly. What a disappointment, I adored the first one. Epic fail."
"This is even more boring than having to boringly sit for over 3 boring hours watching the boring vacation photos of a boring family you don't know nor care about in a boring island where everything is boringly blue.If the original Avatar succeeded in the box office it was only due to the 3d gimmick which was new over a decade ago, but today? There is absolutely nothing new. Or rather, all the small new things add nothing to fix the major flaws that have been all over this film since the beginning: The plot is lame, the characters are uninspired and unrelatable and there is simply no reason to care about them or the very little that actually happens in over 3 hours of boredom."
Watched the 1st one and really enjoyed it. This one was ok. The 1st hour and last hour were good. The 2nd hour was Boring.Oh it was 100% a beautiful movie. But we've seen this all before. It's 2022 not 2009. If you're impressed by the CGI in 2022 that's amazing.The reason they went to the water would was hollow.. the humans aren't just there to destroy Jake. They want the planet.. so I guess a Jake doesn't care about that.I'm hoping some of the side stories will be fleshed out next movie like the daughters powers.The pacing was very slow. 1 fight scene in the beginning and then nothing for an hr or so.Definitely won't watch again but I may go see the 3rd movie cuz improvements could be made.
"""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is a showcase of technology, much like the original film was. Experience it in IMAX 3D. You'd be doing yourself a disservice not to do that. This was built for a very large screen. All of the 3D implementation in this film is not forced and feels very natural, like you're an inhabitant of Pandora as well.James Cameron's beautifully crafted world gets expanded on a ton here. The luscious forests and jungles of the first film are traded in for coral reefs, beaches, and waters teaming with life. Truly incredible visuals that will have you questioning what is CGI and what is real. We've come a long way from the T-1000 in ""Terminator 2.""The plot is nothing spectacular, just kind of run-of-the-mill Cameron stuff. Passable and fine, nothing too amazing but nothing silly, corny, or stupid. I will say that although he doesn't make super well-crafted and thought-provoking stories, what he does best is push technology to its limits and fill the screen with absolutely gorgeous pictures.Cinema is really a three-fold art, in my opinion; the story and script, the characters and acting, and the visuals and effects. Most films struggle achieving greatness in even one of those, and I think it's nearly impossible to find one film that really fills all of those cravings at once. Hence why we have more than one ""greatest film of all time"" and why that can be an argument that stretches on forever with differing opinions on the matter.As for the acting performances, the one that really stood out to me was Zoe Saldaña as the mother, Neytiri. Great stuff here. Most of the other performances are pretty good here. I kind of dislike the whole ""bro"" and ""cuz"" dialogue, it gets kind of annoying and cheesy sounding to me. The family dynamics are all really good to me and if anything the plot is not bad and gets the job done bringing us through the world and seeing its peacefulness and natural beauty and also a great climactic action set piece (that part definitely out stayed its welcome and lasted about twenty minutes longer than it should have if I'm being honest).With all of this praise I'm heaping on, is it perfect? Nah. I will say it's definitely a must-watch at this time of year and serves as an excellent sequel to the first film. The 3D and CGI spectacle of it all will blow you away."
"I'm sorry, I just don't get the hype with these movies. The first was overrated. The visuals are great, but it falls short everywhere else. Over hyped, awful storyline, and overrated. Not worth over three hours of my life. Save yourself sometime and take a vacation three hours away, you enjoy it more than sitting in the theater for three hours. Actors do their best to work with a subpar plot and they can't be blamed. They want a paycheck and that's what it comes down to for them. Sigourney Weaver should have known better than to ruin herself with this movie. Such a great actress in a poor and sorry film."
"The marketing for this movie lied. They said this was going to be the movie event of a generation and it's not. It's the movie event of an entire life time. Nothing could have prepared me for the visual brilliance and magnificence that James Cameron and his team have been cooking up for the past decade.It is pure visual splendour on a level I don't think any director has ever been able to achieve before. The sincerity and emotion are on a level that far surpasses the rest of the mulch that Hollywood has put out over the last decade and it's a refreshing reminder what a singular vision can achieve.Cameron called this the 'Manhattan Project' and he was totally correct, this blew me away about as hard as getting hit by an atom bomb would."
"Yes it brings you in and is very innovative. The sequences and how everything moves and works together is very nice to take in and visually stunning. We got that with the first one and now with this one as well.Where this falls short big time is the story. The story is very light and a little all over the place. You're going from sully being hunted to sully learning how to swim and then oh wait.. here is a story of how some whales know how to communicate with the locals, back to sully and his family swimming..Now on to one of the family members having special powers and staring at the sand for a bit.. okay now back to Sully escaping the crazed captain wanting sully dead. Mix that in with some really bad acting by the kid that played Spyder and you have a very sporadic story with no consistency.The ending however and some of the swimming scenes were very immersive and inviting. Overall just a 5/10 and probably gonna skip the rest of the avatar saga completely now."
"Such an empty empty movie. Truly a let-down. All the magic and meaning of Avatar gone. The beauty of Avatar was that feeling of what that wild but authentic living, interconnected with nature and community, real bonding, real values. Avatar 2 was so low-consciousness; the opposite of the brave and high-ideal vision of the original Avatar. Honestly, there was nothing to take in in Avatar 2. Just things blowing up, events that meant nothing, completely unnecessary conversations, no real, advanced ethics and nothing inspiring at all. In fact, it felt like an assault to the energy of the first Avatar, as if the world which touched and uplifted us so was being severely downgraded to an unoriginal, mundane, and pitiful version of human characters, relationships and communal living. A shame."
"I personally really enjoyed avatar (2009), whilst the story wasn't the most original, it made up for it with a good cast and great VFX. This movie is a stain on that movie and James Cameron's career as a whole.The action scenes are way too fast, like the audience is supposed to have the attention span of a haddock. Throughout the movie the special effects were laughably low-quality, it felt like I was watching a cutscene for a cheap xbox 360 game.The story was moderately original this time but the characters were so unlikeable including Jake sully who just came off as unbearable jerk. I gave the film 2 stars as the only character who wasn't cocky, arrogant or annoying was Sigourney weavers kiri, she had a pretty decent subplot and was one of the only characters I liked.My opinion. Just save your cash and rent the first one on amazon."
"The movie's plot was terrible. It took 13 years to make this movie; how come nobody noticed the mediocre story? This movie is basically a director saying, ""look, I can put together the best CGI visuals Hollywood can offer."" Everything will look prettier than any other movie, so it must be a masterpiece! I stop caring about the characters 40 min into the movie. Keep looking at my watch, wondering how much time was left before I could go. I can understand a director ending up with a 3-hour movie if most of the scenes were essential for the overall story. But that's not the case here. I would cut 2 whole hours out of this movie."
"Well there was half an hour or so of beautifully done scenes where I actually felt like I was swimming/sailing through the rough seas.And then the other 2 hours where a half dozen regurgitated storyline's got thrown together with a large dose of 'greed is bad' pitched in for good measure. A one dimensional plot, and lots of hissing/yelling.And whales have tattoos now. So I have to add another 197 characters to finish this review. Sully's stick together, unless they are from Monsters Inc, but he's the same colour as the Sully's in this movie, so maybe.I did like the new lightweight exoskeletons though, unless they are being used to drink a cup of coffee. Trying to show us how awesome they are I guess."
"My title says it all. I felt like I was watching a Barbie kids show. The story was the same as the first one. The whole thing was dumb and cringey. It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. It sits down there with the likes of Avatar: The Last Airbender the movie, not the animated series. There was too many characters, no depth at all, using the kids... H yeah we haven't seen that before. Please don't see this movie. It feels like a G movie, not even a PG13. The writers of this movie shouldn't ever do anything again. It's worse than M. Night Shamalyan movie. I can't believe I wasted 2.75 hrs of my life... I walked out with 30 minutes left. Horrible."
"Overall I enjoyed it....must watch at least once. I saw the first one twice in theaters. Storyline for seconds one is weak. Plot doesn't justify the movie. Go and enjoy it....one time watch for sure. I think characters were good, acting was good. We needed more excitement like the first one had. Water scenes were amazing , the whales were great. For next ones I would hope they show more war scenes where avatars are kicking humans behinds back to earth. Something was lacking in the sequel and still it gets an 8 from me. Take some popcorn and enjoy it...the CGI gets 7 and storyline get 1 , need better stronger story with such good CGI."
"James Cameron's magnificent long-awaited sequel to his classic 2009 blockbuster original is an incredible cinematic experience, every shot is like a work of art with stunning CGI visual effects that are truly breathtaking and the finest most photorealistic 3D IMAX imagery ever produced. It's been 13 years since Cameron's groundbreaking Oscar winning sci-fi epic ""Avatar"" was released immersing the viewer for the first time into the unique and beautiful alien world of Pandora. Cameron now takes us back to Pandora with a masterful film that is pure escapism and filled with adventure, suspense, humor, and some truly heartfelt emotionally powerful moments. Set over a decade after the events in the original film, Human turned Na'vi Jake Sully, terrifically played by Sam Worthington, and his Na'vi wife Neytiri, remarkably played by Zoe Saldana, now have a large family, his eldest son Neteyam, younger son Lo'ak, youngest daughter Tuk, and adopted daughter Kiri, which are all marvelously played by Jamie Flatters, Britain Dalton, Trinity Jo-LiBliss, and Sigourney Weaver, and a teenage human named Spider, wonderfully played by Jake Champion, who was left as an infant behind because babies cannot be put into cryo-sleep for the 6 year journey back to Earth. Their peaceful and loving lifestyle is shattered when the Earthlings who they call the Star-People arrive and drop from the skies with a massive military force led by General Ardmore, superbly played by Edie Falco, who enlist the help of the clone avatar of the late Colonel Miles Quaritch, sensationally played by Stephen Lang in a scene-stealing performance, which has his personality and all of his memories implanted in it, needless to say this clone avatar Marine with his powerful 12 foot tall Na'vi body intend to hunt down Jake Sully and avenge himself upon the killer of his predecessor, and also put down the hostile resistance for good. Colonel Quaritch and his Marine strike team are hellbent on killing Jake Sully and anybody who helps him. So Sully decides to abdicating his leadership position and leave with his family on a long journey to a tribe of Na'vi that are sea people and follow ""the Way of Water."" Sully and his family seek shelter and are respectfully but half heartedly welcomed by the tribe leaders Tonowari and his pregnant wife Ronal, impressively played by Cliff Curtis and Kate Winslet, what will follow will be the most exciting and jaw-dropping part of this film with extraordinary underwater sequences, heart-pounding battles and an action-packed climax that will have you on the edge of your seat. This film is vastly superior to the original in every way and delivers throughout it's long 192 minutes runtime, and with an estimated budget of $350 million dollars you can see every cent of it on the screen. That cinematic genius James Cameron has done it again pushing the boundaries of cutting-edge technology and brilliantly creating the impossible. The must see film event of the year."
"After movie i feel like i saw again Terminator Titanic with some beauty Avatar scenes. In todays world, when you cant even destroy putin anateurs this fighting is so over distrubing look in christmas time war and fighting. I also would like to cut 1,5 hour from this film to nake it normal movie. Sound is so powerful that please take your headsets with you, else you just may get theft.Underwater scenes are good and these were really something what was worth to sit 3,5 hours in movie chair. If you are not Terminator fannthen better avoid. If you dont like to sit so long then 2 hour of movie was best what comes next is not worth of time."
"This is truly Cameron's second masterpiece, a diamond in the rough, excellent movie from telugu. 3 hours movie even though not getting bored .this is emotions,love ,care, responsibility
Sentimental as well as Indian South movies .This Movie contains values and ethics
Finally I love the movie very much, i watched avatar part 1 more than 10 times , visual effect really amazing in this movie and I never ever seen such kind of graphics . As well as avatar way of water movie also has wonderfull and mind blowing visual effects and graphics and this movie makes me too crazy , I am waiting for part 3."
"Loved the visuals, especially the underwater scenes as these were awesome in 3D (definitely see it in 3D for this alone) but hated the crappy 'Family' plot. I get that this is supposed to be a family friendly movie but it was a Vomitfest throughout! Zero plot unless you call repeatedly saving your brats plot. It was so bad I'm doubtful I'll even bother with the remaining episodes of this 'franchise'. I just can't face the nauseating Brat Family again for another Vomitfest session... It really was dire! Cameron seems to have thrown the plot to the wolves with this movie. Not recommended except to see the CGI visuals! I expected so much more but this? Just sad! Disappointing and sad! Visually stunning but the plot is SO Crap!"
"I would like my moneh back for this festival of unoriginality (if that's even a word). It's nightmarishly stupid, the story lacks any kind of subtlety and is as foreseeable as it gets. The brutally one-dimensional characters are forced into unnecessary conflicts based on the flimsiest of reasons. Sure, it is sometimes nice to look at but not worth spending three hours of absolute boredom. I was really hoping for James Cameron to land another hit but this was as bad a movie as it gets and he should be ashamed of himself. The one actress who carried large parts of the first movie was sidelined, the pacing is terrible and I can see barely anything redeemable about this trash film. Let me know when James Cameron has an original idea again, until then, I won't watch."
"Watching this on IMAX 3D is truly a spectacular big-screen experience, particularly the underwater sequences. Cameron knows well how to immerse his audiences in the incredible sight of aquatic plants and sea animals including the giant whale-like creature.There are some dynamic set-pieces, dizzying action sequences and panicky thrills - but then there is all the ethnological and biological material, like a fanciful issue of National Geographic brought to life in very slow motion (an impression not helped by James Horner's 'world music' score). The balance between these filmic elements is as fragile as Pandora's ecosystem - and there are many moments, even longueurs, where this balance is in danger of tipping the wrong way. Avatar: The Way of Water feels long - a sprawling, indulgent trawl through an invented ecosphere that may mirror concerns of our own planet, but also both explores and exposes the limits of wonder."
"After 13 long years and a never ending swirl of rumours, the fabled Avatar: The Way of Water is finally upon us! Director James Cameron is well known for his massive sci-fi epics and groundbreaking special effects in the spirit of Spielberg and Lucas. But another thing that made him stand out as a blockbuster titan was his talent at making sequels.His previous sequels, Aliens (1986) and Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) helped convince people that sequels can not only be great, but can connect even more deeply to viewers than the OG. The latter was his first film to beat Star Wars as the #1 movie of all time (Titanic and Avatar are the others in case your wondering!😉). So, one of my biggest questions was, how would he follow-up, such a mega-hit and how will it compare to his other sequels?The verdict? It's not a ""better movie"", it's the same movie with better stuff in it.It's actually a much more intimate story set on the same grandiose scale as the first one. Avatar centred on the whole of Pandora and protagonist Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) uniting its people against a common foe. This film sees Jake as a father who has been raising his 5 children, now teenagers. When the humans return, and this time stay, he then has to abandon his people and seek asylum to keep his family safe.The first half is the weakest half. We get introduced to the family, a whole bunch of forced callbacks and a big freight train heist with dragons and choppers all at once. The rushed script makes it feel like Cameron fast-forwarding the film to get to the stuff that he wants us to see. But one could say that was true for the first one. Once we arrive at the undersea Na'vi clan, the film really starts going. The rest of the film is basically a repeat of the first Avatar but the action takes a dive to the unexplored depths of Pandora's oceans.Cameron's sequels always follow the template of the original but the thing is, he makes them matter. The family dynamic is one way he adds new urgency to the movie. Each child has their own arc and each are good in their own way, particularly Spider (Jack Champion). Born human and raised by Na'vi, he finds himself torn by his true heritage and his new family, while Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) questions where his true heart lies...A friendship between bullied Lo'ak (Britain Dolton) and an outcast ""Tulkan"" is surprisingly moving and Kiri (a 73-year old Sigourney Weaver) swaps the parental figure role her previous character Grace served in the first. Cameron's mixing of special effects, action and eco-centric story also impacts just as strongly as the first.Finally, it's one of the coolest worlds ever created for film and it's such a delight to explore and experience new stuff in it. There aren't a lot of filmmakers out there bold enough (or crazy enough) to create a fresh new world with story that feels truly universal. But James Cameron is certainly one of them.Maybe this long-awaited return to Pandora is something that movie fans really need right now..."
"The visuals are amazing. There is no denying that. The water effects looks amazing the characters do look amazing. Everything else is fine. The characters and story are fine. I will admit that for a 3 hour movie that it didn't drag, but I don't remember much about it. I saw this movie four hours ago. I swear that it's already leaving my memory. I don't know how James Cameron thinks he can make over five movies about dull characters and plot. I don't even remember the characters names. Even the main character's name. There is an interesting aspect of father and son dynamics that would be interesting if it didn't boil down to bad guy bad and good guy good. There are some dumb plot beats here and there, but most of the plot feels unimportant to the main draw of the film. The visuals. Which I wouldn't mind if the characters were more interesting. Which they are not. This film didn't annoy me. I did like my 3d experience with this film while I was watching it. So, I was considering it a six. Then I realized that the memory of the film was quickly leaving my brain somehow. Including the main character's name within four hours. The only reason why I would watch this again would be to refresh my memory before the Third film comes out. That's it."
"Having seen the first film when I was but a teenager, I had to revisit the first film before I enjoyed the next phase in Cameron's Avatar franchise. Surprisingly, I did in fact love returning to Pandora in the initial movie and a part of me remembered why I loved that movie. I fully agree that the Original story has its cliche moments and the story is not exactly original. But the world Cameron built and the visual effects his teams were able to accomplish. The movie really was a spectacle. Personally I think the first has a lot of heart as well.As far as the sequel goes, nothing really surprised me. I was excited to see more of this alien planet and the species who inhabit it. The story of Jake and Natyri**, (guessing on that spelling) and their family is a very easy to understand plot. But for me, it was so refreshing seeing a huge movie have such a down to earth story which pretty much revolves around protecting your family and the problems that trying to do that entail. I will agree with others, their is some campy dialogue, cliche moments, a few poor line deliveries, and an over all unsurprising plot. BUT. Wrapped all together, with heart, overall theme everyone can enjoy, INCREDIBLE actions sequences, and with the greatest visuals I have ever seen on screen, this is one hell of a good time.Go see this with your family over the holidays, or with some friends in order to get away from the family. Hell, go by yourself. I have. Once with friends and again solo because I had to look at this movie again. It really is an experience. 3D or not, see this on an enhanced screen. IMAX/DOLBY or something similar. Seeing this movie is an event and you should treat it like it.I had fun. Because this movie is Fun. Which is what going to the theater is about. FUN."
"Like the original Avatar movie, The Way of Water is visually beautiful and does a fairly good job at world building, introducing sea life and marine ecosystems. The actions scenes are pretty great as well.However, while its predecessor had a solid well tested plot, a good pacing and even some character development, the writing in the second one is disappointingly bad. The plot is messy and drags way to long, the characters are forgettable and act implausible. To make matters worse, they introduce some new sci-fi tech, that totally contradicts the premise of the first film just to bring back one of the most one-dimensional bad guys of movie history that no one missed in the first place.Despite all these flaws I still think it's worth to watch, especially on the big screen, that's how beautiful it looks. Just don't expect much behind the eye candy."
"I loved the first Avatar, but must admit I got skeptical when I heard they were doing several sequels. Can Cameron and his team really keep this franchise interesting enough to justify the many years and resources spent on all the sequels when you not anymore can offer the surprising, spectacular, almost groundbreaking feel that the first one had? The result so far is at least better than I had expected, and the second half is better than in the first movie, but the movie itself wasn't as mind-blowing as the first given we've already been introduced to the world of Pandora. Introducing sealife and underwater scenes helped though.Outstanding visuals, a good enough story (if you're not too fussy about plot-holes), charming enough characters and of course all the not-so-subtle digs at the many nature-threatening industries out there. They also kept some of the excellent melodies of the late James Horner. I think especially the naive dreamers and the young will get really inspired by this movie, and the environmentalists, but people in general too will probably enjoy it.I was almost expecting some hidden product placement of a Colgate toothpaste during the movie considering all the numerous perfect and sympathetic smiles, but couldn't spot any red and white logo anywhere. Plus, maybe the avatars don't actually brush their teeth, given they probably stay away from refined sugar and processed foods? Oh well, so I guess they just tried to give a good feel to the viewers instead (and show how happy and great your teeth become if you live in harmony with nature), and I'd say they weren't completely out of touch with this one. Why not.The weaknesses imo are:Bringing back the villain from the first movie, although in a different outfit. He did show a hint of a redeemable trait though, but it would have worked better with a new, charismatic villain. It's like Star Wars introducing ""a new and improved"" Death Star in every second new movie instead of going a bit more creative on the script and plot.Painting the villains so evil, unsympathetic and despicable with no redeeming qualities whatsoever that it gets almost comical. Way too childish and black and white portrayal, and a few too many silly Avengers-style one-liners.I actually liked the fact that the climax wasn't some large-scale invasion battle as opposed to in the first one. This worked fine, and making it about family gave the battle scenes a bit more soul and emotions.I became slightly less skeptical about the Avatar-sequels after seeing this movie, so that's a good sign. And it's one of the few movies where I actually preferred the second half over the first."
"The maximum credit for the film goes to James Cameron. The way this film goes is mesmerizing. Initially the movie time looked lengthy, but after watching we felt hungry for more. The way sir James creates movie is well known, either it is Terminator series or Titanic the legendary movie. While some movies based on present time or past needs research, the fantasy genre needs imagination. In Avatar the way one imagines a different planet and its various creatures is really remarkable. The way bad side of humanity is shown is really worth of it. The future concept of machines, crafts and subs is really very well shown. All the VFX shown doesn't looks like VFX at all, it looks like real. Really waiting for the next parts....."
"I wonder why sequels have always to be darker and more and more violent. Outstanding visual effects don't compensate the lack of a consistent plot which is not better than a far west of the fiftees when a clan of bandits bully a peaceful village and, of course, all together become the heros at a heavy price. Last thirty minutes are cloned from Titanic adding an orgy of violence and opening a door of a new sequel since the awful baddy leaves alive. I wouldn't recommend it to younger audiences, not to mention children, specially keeping in mind that this film is premiered as Christmas family consumption."
"Yesterday we went to the cinema to watch Avatar: The Way of Water. We all had a great time (the popcorn was delicious), but, sadly, this is a movie just to entertain, and really for teenagers I would say. I guess the priority here was to make money. How is it possible that a 350MM movie has such a poor story line and such a bad script? This always surprise me with American blockbusters. Couldn't they hire writers who actually can write a deep and meaningful story? Also, all the characters here were flat and one-dimensional (impossible to care for them). And some were actually annoying. Pity. 2/4 of the movie are battles, 1/4 of the movie is National Geographic with invented animals (the coolest part of the movie) and the other 1/4 is just beautiful cinematography. Where is the story line? This was a missed opportunity. Overall, 5/10 (1 point for the special effects, 1 point for the music, 1 point for the cinematography, 1 point for the invented animals, and 1 point for the fun of watching the movie in the cinema with my children)."
"Janes Cameron literally wrote his heart out! The screenplay, taking, VFX everything's top notch. Kudos to effort of the team. Must watch.Everybody's role was well defined. Honestly,I expected more action sequences with Jack Sully. The water fight lasting around 20 minutes just flew by. Although there are few lag scenes before the Sky People enter the Sea territory, the movie never ceases to surprise us. The hardwork of the VFX artists us reflected in every part of the movie.There are also lot of family values shown in the movie, hence children can also learn. So, it can suit people of any age group.Quartich's face looks way too similar to Sully's so they should have made it more meaner and different. There isn't any post credit scene in it.Eagerly waiting for the 3rd part!!"
"I thought Cameron was better than fake reviews!! I think I was the only one still awake in my theatr when the movie ended. Entire acts are wasted on fruitless world building. Neytiri exists purely as a plot device not Jakes wife and Jake is too boring to carry the story. This is not avatar 2 its Jake Sullys Kids get into antics. Physics decide when they want to exist or not. Too many questions and no answers. The 3D version looked so bad it was like watching videogame cutscenes. I expected at least an improvement in the CG department after 13 years but there was zero. Cameron has given up, and jumped the shark."
"Very boring narrative, nothing new or fresh. The movie is just a copy of hundreds of other similar movies and a copy of the first Avatar. Yes, the graphics look at an excellent and decent level, but sometimes the characters moved angular and did not look plastic. The first Avatar was distinguished by excellent music accompanying the film, and the second Avatar, unfortunately, cannot boast of this. In general, the film was a complete disappointment. The only pleasant moment in the movie is the beautiful locations in which the characters act. This, perhaps, is the end of all the advantages of this movie."
"Not sure how this gets such a high rating ? It's far too long . The first hour might aswell not have happened as it's slow , boring and no idea what was going on . It does get a little better after that but the storyline is poor and if I hadn't watched it in 3D I probably would of walked out of the cinema for the first time ever. The film could easily have been made in 2 hours . Even the kids agreed they had no clue what was going on in the first hour . Maybe it gets good reviews because of the 3D aspect but I will never watch it again , I wouldn't bother watching it in 2D at all as it's not a great film."
"I am extremely disappointed in the sequel to Avatar. While the first film was a groundbreaking and visually stunning achievement, Avatar 2 falls flat in every other aspect.It is clear that James Cameron is more interested in showcasing his CGI skills than in crafting a compelling and well-written story. The plot is weak and unoriginal, with shallow characters and predictable plot points. The acting is wooden and unconvincing, and the dialogue is cringe-worthy.I was extremely frustrated with Cameron's obsession with CGI over substance. While the special effects are impressive, they cannot save the film from its numerous flaws. It is clear that he prioritized visual spectacle over storytelling, and the result is a shallow and unengaging film.Furthermore, the film's runtime is excessive and indulgent, with scenes dragging on for far too long. I found myself checking my watch multiple times during the film, eager for it to be over. It was a tedious and painful viewing experience, and I would not recommend it to anyone.Unfortunately, Avatar 2 is a huge disappointment and a clear example of style over substance. It is a prime example of James Cameron's ego and lack of storytelling ability, and I would strongly discourage anyone from wasting their time and money on this film."
"Avatar: The Way of Water is not only reminiscent of a video game in terms of visuals, but the film also has a completely convoluted and confusing story. At many points, the film reminded me of the Final Fantasy games, whose stories are often confusing and often forgettable, but which impress with breathtaking vistas and images, stirring emotional moments and epic action scenes. Avatar 2 offers the same.James Cameron has tried to weave too many ideas and characters into the film. While the first part told a very simple and archaic story, for which it was heavily criticized, here they seem to have tried to make the plot more complex and multi-layered but didn't really succeed. Maybe it's also because too many screenwriters worked on the story besides Cameron, and everyone wanted to bring their own ideas into the film.Ultimately, there are a lot of ideas thrown into the film that aren't really explored or thought through. There are many elements that are brought up and then never mentioned or are relevant again. Also, there are just too many characters that seem interesting but don't really have room to develop in the story and remain in the background without us really getting to know them (perhaps we'll have to wait for the sequels). The dramaturgy is often very convoluted, for example, the main antagonist disappears from the screen for almost an hour while the story takes on a completely different pace and feel, only to suddenly drops back into the story at the beginning of the third act. This especially reminded me of the feeling I had with games like Final Fantasy X or Final Fantasy XV (the comparability with FF X is also given by the water theme and spiritual aspects). Also, the plot invents way too many elements that just don't fit with what we saw in the first part, just to bring certain characters back into the story or because James Cameron liked to work with certain actors. Also, I find that certain aspects of the story don't fit with the spirituality of the Navi as we got to know them in the first part.But still, the film works on an emotional level. The relationship of Jake's family, the spiritual connection to the animals and the planet, but especially the surprising emotionality of the antagonist worked for me. The design of Pandoras oceans and creatures is fantastic and still unique, as it was in the first part, and the visual effects are indescribably beautiful. And the last hour was just insane, with about an hour of excellent action in typical James Cameron style. Overall, I thought Avatar: Way of the Water was a good movie. Mainly because of the visuals, the little emotional moments and the crazy action. So basically, not that much different than the first part. However, part 1 was much more focused and thought out in my opinion. The dramaturgy was much more structured, and the characters were stronger."
"The first movie sucked me in with a great story so I couldn't wait to see the sequel. Sadly, I was sitting there just waiting for it to be over, thinking this movie is way too long, who wrote this? Why are the kids doing dumb things over and over to make this movie take even longer? This is a mostly non stop action film, no story line, and stunning visuals. I recommend not seeing it as to not taint your memory of the original.Spider saves his dad in the end so going out on a limb that this is how they make a third way too long, no story line action film with more great visuals sequel to the sequel."
"The more I think about the film the more I think it sucks. Their decision making follows zero logic! They are winning a gorilla insurgency with an impenetrable stronghold but have to flee for safety? The colonel keeps threatening he'll kill sullys kids in an attempt to lure him out, if he would've just killed em I guarantee Jake Sully would persue him! Awful film. Won't be seeing it again. 0/10 stars. I expected more from James Cameron. Perhaps I am being overly critical here, but I don't think I am. I'm only adding these last couple of sentences to fulfill the character requirement to post a review."
"After watching first Avatar movie I was stunned, everything was perfect. I watched the movie hundreds of times. The expectation was very high.The visual of the movie is very fantastic. The 3D seems real. It was a great experience visually. Overwhelmed with the visual effects.The story was missing, it seems like a very common story. It was very predictable. Some scene was elongated which was boring. Seems like watching discovery channel in 3D in the cinema.My personal rating is 7 for this movie only for the visualisation of the Pandora's water & the animals under the water. May be for the movie I would give a 5.We have got lot's of finest movies from Jams Cameroon. He is one of the talented directors of all time. We expect something better than this."
"Yeah, the graphics looks great most of the time. Fantastic work by the effects teams. That can't be denied. Some parts are still a little iffy, but eh, nobody's perfect. That said, the effects are all this movie has going for it. The story is a retread of the first movie, just wetter. Even that dang villain is the same! Switch out one macguffin for another, add some water, bam, you got Avatar 2. Oh, and there are kids in it now too that do nothing but make terrible decisions that get everyone else into trouble. They also swim with some space-whales in sequences that go on farrrr too long. Seriously, this movie could be okay if the middle was trimmed way down. LIke, cut an hour of of this movie and it'd be fine. I don't mind long movies if it makes sense for the story, but this movie has little to no story and the runtime is basically so Cameron can go ""Hey look at the what our effects team can do!"" I was conned into seeing it in theaters for the ""experience"" and the ""3d"" but it's not worth it. If you really want to see this one, just wait and watch it at home."
"I find that the whale in the movie represents a pattern that exists in most of the male characters and some of the female ones too.So there is this whale which was banished from its group because it tried to rebel against the humans causing the death of many other whales. So their deaths are apparently his fault. So the when the humans attack his blue people friends, AND the blue people decide to stop the killings by sacrificing their leader (Jake), the whale goes ahead and ignites a battle which ends up killing more humans and more blue people, one of which is a semi main character.Violence is always the answer I guess.Also when the blue people hiss to intimidate they just look ridiculous like angry stray cats."
"Well... the Quality of the movie is stunning! I really enjoyed that, the story however... its bad.. once again the bad guy is back, as a robot or clone...The Worst part of the movie was the last war, it begins with all of the water avatars, then all of the sudden its just Jake Sully and his family left fighting - where did the rest of them go? I guess we have to assume they swam back to relax or something? Its horrible to watch, and it was the only thing on my mind «where is the rest of them!!???»this movie has been 10years + waiting for people only to spit them in the face - the writers should find a New job."
"It is hard to bring back those feelings when you would go to the cinemas as a kid and that magic and wonder left you wanting more of that world. This for me brings all that back, i watched the first movie at university and now as a father myself the story of family brought me tears of joy and sadness and left me excited about the next chapter of this amazing saga. Thank you James Cameron for bringing these pieces of joy to our lives. My heart was captivated. Very entertaining from start to finish with a lot of emotions, ups and downs. I cannot wait to follow this epic journey with my own children."
"James Cameron delivers on everything here. The way he always expands upon modern cinema and forms it to his imagination will always be inspiring to me.This movie has some of, if not, the best cgi i have ever seen in a movie ever. It totally knocks all other modern movie-cgi out the park. The story is easy to follow and the characters are a lot better than in the first. Not as much action, but when there is action, i found it to be very good.I might prefer it over the original movie, since we spend so much time just taking in the absolute beauty of Pandora's oceans, and i love it. James Cameron definitely knows we're all here to see the beauty of the visuals, and he and his creative team do not disappoint. Bravo!"
"Back in 2009 when Avatar came out we were all stunned by its beautiful and realistic visuals, it was the best at the time. 13 years later, we get Avatar 2, yet again are we blessed with the best visuals to date. I could go on and on about how good the CGI is, instead I'll save myself the time and say that you've just witnessed the greatest CGI ever. Period.Did this hold up to the massive expectations and 13 year long wait? Definitely. Frankly it couldn't have turned out any better, to me this is the perfect sequel to a perfect first movie. This strong come-back 100% justifies the long wait.As for the story, it follows a similar structure as the first, this time the humans are back again stronger than ever. The story hits very hard emotionally especially when we get to see the space ships land on Pandora, the way they incinerate and kill everything in their way, and that we know that this is not the first time this has happened. Miles is back reincarnated in an Avatar body and he's out for Sully for revenge, the hunt for Jake and his family is almost getting exhausting by the end, it goes on and on but finally pays off with an epic battle on a sinking hovercraft/boat ship, I bet James Cameron was really exited about a small scale recreation of Titanic.I'll simply sum up my thoughts and opinions about the story. I think it's a simple story that we've seem many times before, there where many similarities to Avatar 1 and even a few lines that where completely the same, basically just as a reference to the preceding movie. The story is simple and digestible, it doesn't have to be complex, I like Avatar because of the beauty in it's simplistic plot and story line.In summary, this movie is all entertainment, there's not a single frame of this movie I wouldn't print out on a poster and put it on my wall, every single shot is beautiful. The action scenes are also next level s**t, choreographed better than anything I've ever seen, it's the coolest most badass s**t I've seen. I'm already excited for the next installment in the franchise, and I can't wait for the home release of Avatar 2."
"It's a story that is especially made for kids to watch, a movie with poor dialogue, tje story development is t great either, the CGI looks to much artificial, to clean looking, games these days has a better visual experience, i don't say it's done badly, but it look way to clean, to nice, to polished. Then the duration of the movie shouldn't have take more of 3+ hours with a predictable story with poor dialogue, when watching 3+ hours with 3D glasses is *not fun* these days, it got distracts the viewing experience by everything. 3D is a gimmick they should not use anymore these dayside . Not worth the time."
"Jake's children are seriously disobedient, everything bad that is happening to him, his family, and other natives is because of his children. The general finds Jake the first time in the forest because his oldest son disobeyed Jake and secretly brought his younger siblings with him getting everyone caught by the general. He found Jake the second time because his children disobeyed him again, went beyond the reef, and got spotted by the general.The son was even admonished 4 times for talking back to the leader of the water people. His children aren't very likable in my opinion, I can't be the only one who picked up on this."
"It's fine and that's it. Like everyone says, it looks great and I agree. It's entertaining I guess, but it's just, well, fine.The story is mostly pointless. We once again have an over the top villain, which seems to be a Cameron trademark ever since Titanic. By the way, the cartoonish villain in this one is the same one from the first movie, except in Avatar form. Really? 13 years and that's the only brilliant villain they could come up with? They forgot about all the humans coming back to inhabit Pandora because Earth is dying. This tidbit is mentioned for 10 seconds early in the movie then never mentioned again.So what is this movie about? Well, the evil villain from the first one is back in Avatar form (although the movie repeatedly tries to convince you it's not the same guy) and he still wants to kill Jake Sully. That's it. The worst part is he lives at the end. JFC. I'm lowering my rating now that I remembered that."
"As other reviewers have said the visuals on this movie are ground breaking and beautiful. So much effort and talent has been painstakingly poured into this movie over the last 12 years.The story however is simply a very much watered down version of Avatar 2009 (pun most definitely intended), and not in a good way.The start of the movie is dragged around with a rushed narrative from Sam Worthington to quickly summarise the events since the end of the last movie. Even at the beginning of the movie it felt rushed...and that feeling does not change through out the movie.....I can only think that James Cameron had 5 hours of movie time and needed to squeeze it into 3 hours.In the first movie the human visitors to Pandora were mining for the metal Unobtainium ..... in AWoW this is no longer a concern.....and the General makes mention of Earth dieing and the need make Pandora their new home..... however this not referred to throughout the rest of the movie.Stephen Lang.is brought back from the dead in the form of an Avatar .... But this is muddled at best and to my mind it would have been better to bring in a new villain.The watered down story and characters makes you feel disconnected from the movie and characters and there is just no emotion in the movie ...... until the scene where the human harpoon the whale.... This is truly sad and is the first time I felt engaged by the movie. Shortly after the whale is killed they harvest its brain fluid and make mention it stops human aging.In the first movie Jake Sully was a central character and the story was built around his struggle between for filling his mission to infiltrate the natives of Pandora and falling love with the forest and the native people and then fighting to save themIn AWoW Jake Sully is simply a refugee running away from the humansIt's painful to go on because I really loved the first movie.... But this second movie is such a mess from a story perspective..... the story is simply an after thought .... And is simply not good enough to entertain and engage.I give this 5/10 solely based on the beautiful visuals ...... if I rated the movie based on the story or rather lack of it I could give no more than 2."
"I will start by saying this: the visuals are insane. Even the subtitles are insane, they're just floating their in the theater (if you see a 3D version, which you most definitely should be). I saw this in IMAX 3D and the visuals really were mind-blowing. That's about where my praise for this movie ends.The first hour of this movie was actually very intriguing and set up a lot of interesting tropes and plotlines to explore, making it easily the best part of the movie. Unfortunately, once Jake and his family arrive at the water place, it gets pretty boring/repetitive. After Jake's kids gets in trouble for the 10th time, it's just obnoxious and a waste of screenplay (that took THIRTEEN YEAERS).Not only did the movie get kind of boring after the first hour, but all those interesting plotlines and characters set up in the first hour are just wasted. 80% of the new characters introduced are essentially useless and hold no impact on the end/outcome of the movie.There were also just blaring continuity issues (especially with the final battle). Regarding the story and lore, there are lots of questions brought up early on, but none really answered by the end. Also, for my IMAX 3D viewing there were framerate drops throughout the entirety of the movie. 95% of the movie played smoothly at 60fps, but then would randomly dip to like 30fps at parts. Not sure if that's because there was an issue with the transfer, James Cameron didn't finish his movie or if it was just my specific viewing experience.OVERALL, the movie had insane visuals, but with an unfocused scattered story with mostly useless new characters introduced, making it kind of a slog to get through. I know I know: ""Avatar is for the visuals man, uhbubububh"", yeah yeah, but after 13 years, I expect a tighter screenplay than this.6.6/10."
"Good visuals but it felt like watching the exact same movie.... Just underwater.I did like the family relations and conflict.There are certain villains that you're like ""really? You're doing THAT?"" but hey....People said the first movie was extremely basic and simple - this is even more basic when it comes to the story.You're going to see this film for the visuals and the 3d. The rest is pretty much so familiar you can just see the first one again and pretense they are underwater.What I really liked was how they introduced the under water creatures. Especially the main one. Hope you enjoy this going to the theater.Don't drink anything!"
"In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face, is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. But there are times when a critic truly risks something, and that is in the discovery and defense of the new. The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations. The new needs friends.Tonight, I experienced something new, an extra-ordinary film from a singularly unexpected source. To say that both the film and its maker have challenged my preconceptions about film making is a gross understatement. They have rocked me to my core. In the past, I have made no secret of my disdain for Director James Cameron filming techniques. But I realize, only now do I truly understand what he meant. Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere. It is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those of the genius now producing the Avatar franchise, who is, in this critic's opinion, nothing less than the finest Filmmaker in Hollywood. I will be returning to future Avatar films soon, hungry for more."
"I sat down to watch this movie with practically no expectations - I am not one, who considers the first Avatar an outstanding movie. However, this movie was offensively shallow in both its messages and its delivery - yes, somehow even more shallow than its predecessor. (I won't spoil the ending, but I will go into details in some other places, not like you can't see these things coming from a mile away).After the humans were forced to leave, Jake had four kids, but their personalities are so... shallow, that I have a hard time remembering them just 2 hours after watching the movie. You have the obedient older brother, the rebel younger brother who always acts like he was left out of a family hug, there's an older sister who's an introverted, kind of angsty nature lover, and finally you have the damsel in distress little sister who had the sad role of delivering most of the bad jokes the movie had (I swear, even the jokes were cliché). The three older kids have the smallest amount of character development, which feels like it's only there so Cameron could cross this off of the list of things a movie needs in order to function at a very basic level.There's also a (completely) human kid called ""Spider"", who is not his father; a fact that we know from the line: ""You are not your father.""Aside from clichés, this sequel also has a lot of exposition, which strangely makes it a movie that despite its 3 hours of runtime feels like it was originally at least one third longer. This is especially jarring when from one scene we switch to another (and not necessarily only when we switch perspectives), and the editing feels even harsher than it is, because we also switch moods.The morals and conclusions of the story are mostly literally told, which makes it feel like I'm watching a cartoon that's target audience is 5 years olds and under. Although I might have offended some 5 years olds just now...Now, for the actual story, it can be told in one sentence, which wouldn't be a problem, if it could be told in more also, but you will have a hard time writing an essay about this movie's plot. Basically the humans come back, put some bad guys' mind into avatar bodies (who failed the previous mission, so why are they the best to be ""avatarized"" again?), Jake runs away, so he can endanger other Na'vis and not his own tribe, and they are SURPRISED when the bad, bad, very bad humans (whale hunter caricatures) come after them, causing more suffering, which concludes with a not-so-big battle. Okay, admittedly this was kind of a long sentence, but when you stretch this to THREE hours, you really start feeling just how... shallow it is. Credit where credit is due, however, there is a scene near the end that gives the movie higher stakes than fighting for pacifist whales (yes, they are so super intelligent, that they became pacifists, which results in them getting killed without effort, the message being... that humans are bad and evil? Sigh...). This, and an other scene involving the main villain and Spider, his kid, were very welcome, adding a little more depth to the otherwise incredibly... shallow characters.A lot of people are probably going to watch this movie for its visuals, so I can't continue without mentioning them: they are good. And that's it... The magic of the first movie is simulated here too, but with water creatures. Some of it looks really good, but you won't watch this movie with dropped jaws, unless you haven't seen any blockbuster in the last decade. It's just my personal opinion, but I found the flaws so distracting, that the visuals, especially since it's not 2009 anymore, just couldn't save the movie for me.I cannot recommend this movie. It treats humans as the worst beings in existence, as if Hitler and Satan had children, and those are the ones sent to Pandora. At least the first movie had some disagreements between Earthlings, but this time aside from some (not) funny lines, and Spider, who's practically a Na'vi from a character perspective, there's not much resistance from human characters. They are oviously trying to set up a big, future main villain, but he still doesn't have a well developed personality by the end of the second (2nd!) movie. Moreover, at some points the lines were extremely cheesy - for example when Jake told the audience what gives a father purpose in his life, I just looked at my father sitting next to me, he shook his head and I had to hold back laughing so much that I got teary-eyed from it. This was at a funeral scene by the way, so you can imagine how invested I was in the characters.Please, if you respect your intelligence and time, watch a more thoughtful movie, or at least a more creative blockbuster. If you really want to watch this for the visuals, just remember, that a decade passed, and think about whether it is worth sitting through a very long movie with a cliché story and shallow characters."
"For good reason, most viewers are stunned by the underwater animations. But for such an elaborated film, the less acceptable is such a shallow, stupid 'plot', certainly the worst I have seen in years. Everything is cliché to promote the good message, no matter whether it makes any sense or not. It starts when the humans return and their landing spaceships' retrorockets cause a devastating wildfire - obviously humans are fireproof and can still land there! From there it gets worse and worse till the end. Why would the humans even provide military resources for a personal vendetta against Jake and his family instead of focusing on the Na'vi who keep on fighting...? This is all so ridiculous that I am done with the Avatar franchise."
"6 stars for my nostalgia for the original Avatar and the wonder I have experienced back then. Both 3D tech as well as the world-building - from the flying mountains to the interconnected ecosystem and Mother Earth / Gaia / Eiwa cross-references. Particularly the fact, that our Earthly ecosystems actually HAVE the similar kind of biosphere interconnections - mushrooms, trees etc. - just a bit more subtle and less VFX. I'd found it awesomely smart to engage kids with those cool dinosaur-esque visuals that they seem to crave these days, all the 3D and computer game plot flow - and in the same time smuggle these important themes from ecology and the human tendencies to destroy the ecosystem that we are all part of.Technically, Way of The Water is still cool as it WAS, but has left the ""nothing new"" aftertaste with me. Despite the need to develop new motion capture for shooting underwater scenes - in the era of CGI, Marvel, sci-fi of whatever scale - it becomes irrelevant to the viewer, if not boring. We have seen so much blinking exploding colorful epic visuals already in the past decade ... that any visual effect evokes just mere ""whatever"".Though, making so long and so expensive movie, with those 13 years waiting time - and having such a poor, generic script, with unbearably generic dialogues and abysmally generic scenes - is almost unforgivable. One more standard Hollywood-esque ""war cry"" or creepy ""Sullies stick together"" scene - and I get serious allergic reaction. Even the military feels ... 1980s.If Avatar ripped off a bit of Aliens music and its immersive experience (descending to a new planet and finding out what is what) ... then Avatar2 goes as far as to rip off the most flat badass ""cool"" dumbness of all the 1980s Action movie cliches ... and a bit of Titanic towards the end. I can't even say if it was an intentional parody, or serious ...well, but the audience was laughing.This was ""traditional family values"" movie in the worst sense, easy-to-sell in Russia, Indonesia or any conservative s***e of our poor planet. Save my family, save good papa, save bro, save wife, save son, save daughter, save bad papa, stick together, you killed my kid and I kill you, roar roar. Disney would blush in embarrassment.I appreciated original Avatar for its real-life analogies - be it local community terrorized by the colonialist exploitative corporation, or even the ""amazed by the ecosystem"" themes ... but these now just merely and poorly echo in the sequel. Yes, there are evil fishermen (a.k.a. Japanese whale-killers, or Chinese elephant killers) and the Earthly re-invasion and take-over of someone else's home infuriates ... but it somehow felt like a poor commentary, failing to achieve more than piss the audience against ""the bad guys"". No subtleties, no psychology, not any more than one-dimensional villains.Even in the large scale ... where does this movie/plot lead to? What is the overall dramatic arc? You destroy that one big bad ship - and what about all those spaceships, the new human colony - the cities and infrastructure they start to build? It's like a ridiculously small battle and victory for the scale of the invasion and expected reprisals. Will the heroic family continue to run? Will they try to establish peace with the invasive human locusts? Did anyone from those who traveled back to Earth report on the absurd injustice of human colonialism, snatching someone else's planet, the genocide committed on Na'vi? Well, but we survived the bathtub battle, yay!Nah, I expected much more for this money and in this era ..."
"The first time I saw the original Avatar I was fascinated. The story, the beautiful visuals, the character interaction and the action scenes were like nothing I had ever seen or even imagined. The film is truely a masterpiece.Perhaps I expected too much of this sequel but overall I was disappointed. The visuals were still great but nothing else really seemed new or creative. Just more of the same, different part of the planet and different time with more violence, more animal cruelty and far less character building.Out of the 3+ hours, only about 20 minutes were really compelling and new. The battle scenes ran so long as to become tiresome and chaotic -- often reminding me of Terminator movies.3D was only noticable occasionally and not worth the extra cost in my opinion."
"With The Way of Water, James Cameron has proven that, after all these years, he is still a master of spectacle. After ""Titanic,"" ""Aliens,"" the Terminator movies, and the first Avatar, he has, once again, delivered an extraordinary blockbuster. He is a filmmaker that understands blockbusters are supposed to be something more than explosions and big-name stars.The setup for this sequel involves a simple good vs evil story. The first act is a catch-up of the Jake Sully family's life and an announcement of the return of Stephen Lang's villain. It feels similar to the original Avatar, in terms of tone and style. The same problems (home place being destroyed) cause the Sully family to move to a water village. Once they arrive, the Way of Water enters a new phase, a new era. The characters dive into the sea, as we dive into a brand new setting and characters.I don't need to tell you how good the visuals are, except the underwater sequences are some of the most impressive computer-generated imagery I've ever seen. Cameron knows how to pace a big movie, and here he makes good use of the 192-minute runtime to deliver an exciting journey with one or two ideas about bonding. He also wants you to know how we are destroying our own planet, and how that doesn't bring any good to any side. It's the same message of environmentalism with the first movie, but it is one that we still need after 13 years.The cast is strong: Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana are better than ever as they make strong leads. The heart of the story belongs to their sons Neteyam and Lo'ak, with a powerful brother relationship. Kate Winslet is unrecognizable as a resident of the water village. One of the biggest distractions, however, is Sigourney Weaver's return as Sully's adopted daughter. A teenage girl with the voice of Sigourney Weaver makes an odd character.This is maybe the only time that the uncomfortable 3D glasses are worth wearing. Sure, the picture is dimmer, but Pandora is not a bright place to begin with. The movie is long, but every minute is worth it. In every shot I can tell that James Cameron wishes his work to be seen on the biggest screen, with the biggest crowd. My advice for you is to grant his wish."
"My relatives wanted to go out to see a movie for the holidays. Pickings are pretty slim out there so Avatar 2 is the default go to movie. Cameron sensed it was necessary to simplify the story for the general masses. But how many times do we have to hear ""I got this bro""? Dumbed down dialogue started to become laughable at times. Yes I understand there were co-writers, but it was all overseen by Cameron. Simplified storytelling gives us the same villain from the first movie, Colonel Quaritch. But wait, wasn't he killed at the end of the first movie? Aaah, in Avatar world, nothing truly dies forever. Through retconning, all the bad guys get to come back. Strike one there for lack of originality. Now on the other hand, there is a rowdy band of whale hunters that are more relatable as quasi-villains.What worked and didn't work at the same time were the fabulous fantasy locations. They were all very pretty, but it didn't gave us a sense of awe. That is simply because you can only present something new to an audience once. Subsequent sequels will not drop jaws like the very first time. I will say the water effects were almost flawless. Underwaterworld shots are gorgeous. To that end, Cameron gives us extended scenes of the Forest family learning the ways of the water. There was agreement with my relatives that those scenes could have been trimmed. I think briefer scenes exploring this place would have had a better impact. Remember 'Less is More'.So all the set pieces throughout the film could've been given a trim without losing impact. In fact more succinct editing could have provided more impact. The showing I went to was in Dolby. For some reason the music sounded too quiet. Especially compared to the foley track. If the music really was mixed quietly, it severely undercut the emotional beats.As for the large ensemble of characters, we see Sigourney Weaver as a teenager, along with a large litter of kids, mostly in adolescence. Cue the rebellious teenagers. Meanwhile Jake, our hero from the first film, gets sidelined a bit in order to give the kids screen time. When he does get some lines, they are sometimes cringeworthy. When the characters interact they become too much like kitty cats. Their cat ears fluctuate. Their cat tails swoop around. And they cat hiss at each other. Then there is the wild boy who is human but grew up with the Forest tribe. The story tries to legitimize his presence with the bad guys. He is kidnapped, but cooperates with their plan to get Jake. At times I had the reaction of ""huh?"" when trying to understand his character. Like why were there more desperate attempts to save the other kidnapped kids but not their human bro?SPOILER AHEADThe simple story leaves little surprise when they battle the humans at the end. There was one unanticipated death. But like I said, don't be surprised if this individual pops back to life in another sequel. The simplified good-guys-against-the-bad-guys story is predictable throughout the finale. Nobody did a double take when all the other characters live to fight another day. But on the other hand, if all the main characters survive the battle, what was the point?END SPOILERAs for being a holiday event movie, it fulfils the requirements for the standard Hollywood movie experience. I would probably go along with other folks and say the first one was better. Partially because it was shorter. Partially because the dialogue wasn't as basic and repetitious.I figured if I was only to see this film once, it should be on the big screen in 3D. To that end it is the rare type of film that is improved by 3D, but watching in 3D is certainly not necessary to still appreciate the look of the film. In some reviews, some people are saying that the emotional beats did not feel as strong as they should be. I partially blame the too quiet music, the clunky dialogue, and some of those beats being a little rushed.I will give this a 6 out of 10."
I drove my 2004 Nissan Altima to this movie with the expectations that it would distract me from my chronic mental deterioration. I however gained a few extra disorders. This movie was so painful my open heart operation where I was given to little anaesthesia and was accidentally stil conscious was a better experience. This movie is like going on a walk with your weird uncle. You expect it to be fun and short. But it is long and traumatizing. I rather watch the top ten live leak decapitations than watch this horrendous pile of story less death of a franchise dog doodoo. I watched a small child write a story about a dog. It was written in crayon on a post it note but stil however had a better story line than this movie. The last time I was this dissatisfied is when I went to a brothel in Vietnam and found out there where to swords in this fight. This movie made me so mad I felt like remaking a scene from the Jeffrey dahmer documentary. Long story short if you want to flee the country without your kids leave them at this horrendously boring and stale movie and drive to Mexico.
"SPOILERS AHEAD.A very long and beautiful looking film but the story is nothing new.. and way too long.A personal peeve is when previous characters that died get brought back somehow... it just cheapens their death. Have faith that you can create new characters we care about.Also major plot hole; the ""company"" are back for the Unobtainaium but get attacked by Jake and co. So send in a Na'vi clone of the bad guy from first film... so Jake and family do a runner.So problem solved!No need to chase the family down - focus on mining the Unobtainium and get rich!! Fools.Oh and then Jake realises at the end he should stay put and defend his family home? Just like he realised exactly the same in the first film just before the climatic battle to defend the family home.Then they throw in some cliched 80's style teenage bullies and some teenage angst and of course a big ship sinking (has Cameron ever directed a film about a ship sinking? Can't recall...) and you've got a good looking but completely unoriginal film. Shame."
"Other than the visual effects, this is an extremely boring movie. Paid extra to watch this in 3D, so many people were yawning or on their phones after the first 30minutes. Don't understand where the 8.2 IMDB rating comes from? It was really hard to sit through the entire movie, can't remember the last time a movie disappointed so much.And what's with all the philosophical preaching in the movie, I watch a movie to relax and enjoy, not get lectured about life and whatnot. This movie was exhausting to watch and was nowhere near as enjoyable as the first Avatar.Also, the movie did not need to be over 3 hours."
"I think the bar has been set too high, if it does not surpass the first one in every respect, it would be seen by some fans as utter rubbish. Which is sort of what happened here with the user reviews. Is it a good movie? It is a fantastic movie, but is it revolutionary like the first one? It definitely is not.Visually it is very impressive I think that just goes without saying. Story wise, it is on the weaker side, though it is by no means, bad. Majority of the screen time is invested in one of two things, a documentary about Pandora's sealife and high school drama surrounding Jake's kids.Colonel Quatrich lacks presence this time around, he hardly did anything or scored a bodycount, for a while I was wondering if he's even meant as the main villain of the movie. The lack of a majorly evil, imposing and convincing antagonist is one of the issues I take. Also Quatrich's team of Navi soldiers contributed next to nothing.The emotional and moral trigger points also lead me to believe the movie was produced for a younger audience. There was almost no screen time on the side of the humans. Why did we, the sky people, also the main villains make some of the decisions we did? What would have helped is a few layers of complexity showing we are not just generic bad guys looking to hurt children for no reason."

It's definitely beautiful... like GORGEOUS! And luckily, at least for me, it seems like the film took a formula from the first film and plopped it in a new environmental context, so the story execution was pretty effective #IfItAintBroke...I will say that because of following a similar formula, there is a ""safeness"" to this story, BUT I think it intentionally sets up something that could really amazing for the third installment.OTHER THOUGHTS:
Highlights: The visual effects and cinematography, thematic followthrough, and Acts Two and ThreeCould've Been Better: A little shift in Spider's storyline to support some character decisions more logically than probably expected."
"Cameron could have easily cut an hour out of the movie and not lost any of the storyline. There were some very long sequences in the water that seemed to drag on and on. I was most surprised though that 3D has not advanced very much since the original Avatar was released. The 3D picture still seems dim and washed out at times, while up close fast-action sequences continue to suffer from blur, even with the 45fps refresh rate. With that said, the imagery is still mostly stunning but don't expect the wow factor of the first movie, there's nothing new here. In my opinion, Avatar: The Way of Water struggles to decide just what type of movie it is, a kid's movie or an adult movie. Much of the dialogue and storyline seems to be aimed at the 12 and under crowd, but then someone's arm is suddenly ripped off. Like the first movie, there's a lot of underlying messaging and subtle innuendo aimed at the audience. I'm sure this will be debated endlessly just like the first movie was. I gave it a 7 out of 10 mostly for the filmography. If I was rating it solely on storyline, it would've received a 5 from me because I was checking my watch about every 15 minutes during the last hour."
"Overall it's a great movie. If you don't care too much about plot holes you will like it. Pretty close to the last one except the metal is not valuable enough now. Now instead it's a ""whale"" brain basically.But the plot holes kinda ruined it for me.A few
You get to follow the bad guy and spider hunt sully in the mountains, they catch one of these birds, then all of a sudden we get to see them on one of these birds flying and training the language of the navi. Like they are best friends all of a sudden? Like what? What happened to the mountain people you were hunting?Where did all the sea people go in the last fight?Where did all the people in the boat disappear to?Where is everyone in the life rafts?When the mother tulkan was hit with a beacon they instantly attacked it. But when Paykan was hit the sea people got a lot of time to remove it. Like why? And why did the sky people hit that tulkan? They said they would only hit one to draw our jake sully. All of a sudden that was not valid anymore?Kiri? So many questions and things that just happens that doesn't make sense. In avatar 1 we learn eywa does not interfere but now she does. Violently or kiri controls eywa? Like what?This was just a few of the plot holes."
"This movie sucks, it's not good it's way too long the pacing is awful (in the 2nd act they forget about the story) the characters aren't interesting and it fails at being a great action film due to its lack of action.I will say the action is good it just barely happens but when it does it is amazing, I just wish there would be more of it.Another praise I would give the movie is the cinematography and CGI I know I already said it in the title but it seriously deserves a lot of praise it's magnificent.Now enough about praising this awful movie you're reading this so I would complain and I got a lot of complaining to do, one of my biggest problems with this film is with it's pacing, this is a 3 hour long movie and somehow it feels even longer, there are a ton of moments that could of been cut, the 2nd act is almost completely unimportant to the movie, and there aren't any action scenes in it to make it seem interesting.Another problem I had with the movie is with it's story, it's not good, I finished watching the movie 2 hours ago and I could not tell you a single plot point, that's how bad it is.Please if you are going to the cinema, just watch the menu instead."
"This movie looks amazing, but thats all it is. Its just eye candy with a lack luster story. Some might find that fine and just enjoy how immersive the enviroment is because the film does that well. But i myself couldnt bare to sit through this emty shell of a story. Theres no motivation for anything that happends. Things just happen.I also had a big issue with the children. They dont really serve a purpose and just get in the way. I cant even tell the two brohers apart from each other because they have no distinguisheble charactreistics and they both have super boring personalities. Also when the brother died it dint have a big impact on me at all.I also wanna mention that the fighting scenes are the cliche ""bullets cant hit the main character"". And i had a big problem with the last big battle where they forget about object permanence. Once someone goes off screen for more than 1 minute they despawn just like its a videogame or something. To explain further the battle goes from the enitre sea tribe being in the battle to everyone is gone without the movie showing them leaving or dying in battle. Theres also this big fish that joins the battle and helps alot and is in good condision but then also just dissaperes to then reapper after the entire fight is finished. Really wierd thing to do and just makes the entire battle seem rigged.Theres alot of minute problems that are scattered around the place and some very major problems and i would say this movie is a dissapointment for being in development for over a decade."
"The first Avatar film was ""Dances With Wolves"" on another planet. The sequel keeps that underlying theme but somehow manages to also be Free Willy with a hangover from Titanic. Money was slathered on effects but that cannot mask the anemic story including some painfully glaring plot holes and terribly cheesy lines. This was one of the least necessary sequels ever and it's overly long to boot. It suffers from the same malaise as most of the recent Marvel movies and ultimately it is much ado about very little. Yet audiences continue to support such drivel with their wallets, so sadly no end to these trends is in sight."
"My son and I went to see the movie about one and a half weeks ago and it was enjoyable enough. First things first, it's absolutely a stunningly beautiful piece of animation. The only issues I had were with the story...it's the same old ""evil settlers vs the peaceful natives"" storyline. It's overused and beaten to death. Way too predictable, you know exactly what is going to happen before it happens. The characters are the same, too predictable to the point of being boring. You know exactly who is going to be captured and held for ""ransom"", who is going to fight back & get killed and who is going to be ""defiant"" and screw up all of the best laid plans. It's BADLY formulaic, simplistic and a bit silly.Finally, it's just too long for the plot. It got to the point where it was just dragging on for the sake of dragging on.Overall it was ok, not nearly as good as the first one."
"The film has great visual effects, and the family bounds that can make you cry. But the main history is poor, lacks more substancial history, wich makes thr movie to run arroind thr family, and the bounds. It does not have the same impact as the first movie, is more like the more ofnthe same. It is the same reasoning as the first movie, but with more characters. It had a great potencial, but unfortunately didn't reach it. It is a movie to watch at your home. But, as i said, have good visual effects and the family thing. If you liked the first movie and wants more of the same, there you go. It was good to watch, but i got disappointed with the results."
"I am nobody to review Mr. Cameron's vision. However I found the storyline very weak. Yes it is a spectacle to watch with some of the stunning scenes. Story narration I felt very slow and dragged at times. Some action scenes were just not necessary. The objective of the corporation involved with invasion of planet was lost in the story line unlike the first version. Movie is too long and i advise not to watch last (night) show - watch it in afternoon or early evening if you want to enjoy the movie scenes - for me it only scenes. Loved the children in the movie. Most of the picturesque scenes of water, Animals and such can be watched in documentaries. Overall watch it for some very good scenes an not for a storyline."
"I wasn't sure what to expect from a 3.5 hour movie. What I got was a surprisingly heartwarming story about family. The visuals were very good and added to the experience. They were improved and reached another level. The textures are so rich.It is true that Cameron has leveraged elements from almost all of his previous films.Now to the good, the film of a father who is desperately trying to do the best that he can for his wife and children. Things do not always go his way, but he never quits. It is the thread through out. Even when the story focuses elsewhere, it still comes back to Jake and his love for his family.Sure this could have been edited a bit, but I wouldn't want to lose the elements the director has presented here."
"Avatar: the way of water
This sequel continues in the same traditions as the first movie. It's a visually stunning piece of art with a message that's not properly explored.With otherworldly visuals, Avatar 2 takes audiences into never explored lands in Pandora. The runtime of the movie is long, not unbearably long though as the visual treat is mesmerising enough to ground a viewer; it's ironic that with the lengthy runtime, avatar 2 still feels rushed.The story is thin and the dialogue is poor (the constant use of 'Bro' from the young actors was cringe worthy, and gives off a poor image of what old people think young people sound like); Avatar 2 is heavily centred on family, but even this isn't portrayed properly. Various subplots are raised and tossed carelessly, while the main plot is also rushed through just to get to the big finish. The characters aren't well fleshed or developed properly; some characters are borderline unnecessary.The action scenes are grand and well choreographed, and the final act is heavily influenced by Titanic (a movie also made by James Cameron).In all, Avatar 2 is a visual spectacle with a relatively thin plot that lacks poignancy.6/10."
"I re-watched the first one just hours before seeing the second one, and went to the cinema with no expectations whatsoever.As for the first movie, the visuals are simply stunning.And that's pretty much the only good thing.The plot is filled with holes (the final battle where the tribe just disappear, pretty much everyone has a flying beast, when this was a warrior rite passage in the first movie, etc)Dumb ideas (choking people underwater... I mean yes, you are already not breathing, why not?)One of the children being incredibly annoying, that listen to no one, put everyone in danger, and get away with a slight ""hey that's bad"".Overall, the 2/3 of the movie are just plain boring, with no ending because there is obviously a third movie coming."
"Woow 0 story, just non. Thanks for putting the first film in a terrible light by releasing this in the cinema.SPOILERS.Just go watch the end fight of the first and after that the second one because THEY are exactly the same. The colonel even pulls his knife auto again. Jake is now not learning how to be NA'VI but how he can be a water person thingy metamakejisiubema,ee or something. AND THE CUTE GIRL FROM THAT VILLAGE SAYS I SEE YOU TO THE SON OF JAKE just like in the first 1. They din't even try not even a bit. I was i could get my money back after sitting there for 3 hours having deja vu after deja vu."
"I am Batman
James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters."
"Shanghai's cinema scene has been descimated by COVID and gov't policies. Haven't seen a movie at the theaters in nine months and after seeing a big Hollywood release was available and finally over my first bout with COVID, I rushed out to see it.Maybe it was the lack of popcorn, but after thirty minutes and watching a brood of obnoxious blue teens and a feral human one, I was ready to walk. IMAX isn't cheap, so the usd 20 price tag kept me seated. I never saw the first Avatar, so was going in fresh, ready to be blown away by the graphics. Yet, it was like watching a highly stylized video game.The space whales were great. Loved the space whales, especially when one went full Avenger.Perhaps it was seeing alien blue people - yeah, I know, they're hybrids raised by a former human - Jake, hiss like cats one minute, then snap, ""Hey bro!"" and ""Come on, cuz!"" the next, but just looked silly. The alien green people - the Way of Water, were straight-up alien, though still acted like moody teens - and a lot of hissing. Perhaps that's just how Jake's 'translation app' made everyone sound - making it easier for the audience to comprehend. Just dumbed it down.Was so thoroughly disappointed that I walked across the street and had Shake Shack. The Christmas Cookie Shake made the world right again."
"After Avatar 1 I said that the script is weak and only CGI saves it. It's the same for this one as well. I left the cinema after half of the movie. Because I felt like I am at amusement park and watching visual effects without any meanings. There are dozens movies with the same story: dad did something at past, now those people came back for revenge. Dad should save his family. Run far away from home, learn new skills and defeat your enemies. I didn't watch till the end but I am sure that he will win. That's the last time I watched Avatar. I gave 3 points because of the people who did CGI. Avatar's story is weak and don't know how many times CGI will save them."
"I am really disappointed after watching Avatar 2. Groundbreaking CGI, although to be honest I kind of like look and feel of Avatar 1 more.But beyond cool VFX effects there is little left to experience.So you have to ask yourself, do you judge movie by VFX or interesting story and good acting ?If you are VFX kind of person then Avatar 2 is perfect movie for you, on the other hand if you are ""thinker"" then prepare to be bored to death.I guess 13 years between these 2 movies wasn't enough for Cameron to put together interesting story. Developing all that VFX technology took all his time, I guess."
"To start of it is obvious to state that Avatar: The way of water is a visual treat. CGI and cinematography are absolute perfection. It looked so much better than all the Marvel/DC films that have come out recently. You can tell most of the though put into the film was the way it looked. Visually outstanding.The pacing of the film was handled quite well, even though most of the film was focused on world building and highlighted the exploration of the films environment. This is not a complaint as this part of the film was absolutey beautiful and well worth the time. Accompanied with a magnificent score, I could not complain. The underwater scenes were mesmerizing.The family theme throughout the film was att the forefront most of the film, which worked well due to the strong characters who were written realistically and stong. Jake's sons were great characters who exhibited depth and development during the films duration.It is important to mention that the action sequences, most prominently in the final act were stunning. The sound design during these high impact action sequences were perfect. Can't complain at all here.The world building was another aspect that impressed me. Even though it did not progress the larger plot of the film, these moments did enrichen the world of Pandora and the different tribes and people in it. I loved seeing the techniques and equiptment used in the water tribe.Zoe was a standout for me as Neytiri. Her performance was full of emotion. Top stuffMy favourite aspect of the film was the relationship formed by Lo'ak and the Talkun water creature. It was authentic, rich and beautiful.On to the negatives.I noticed that some of the dialogue was corny and cringe during the fight and action scenes. Remarks by the Aussie villian came across as such.The plot was definitely the weakest part of the film. They had so much time to think of a new and reviving plot but all we got was a copy and paste villain hunting Jake and his family. Thats it. Bit weak. A different villian was certainly needed to propel the story further. The refresh Quaritch was lame.Also. Quaritch and Spider's relationship was weak. Spider knew he was wanting to murder all of his people. Yet still saved his life. I know Quaritch saved spiders but in both circumstances their heroic saving seemed forced.Was Avatar: The Way of Water better than the first? Probably not. Story wise, no. Visually yes. I think this outcome was expected. Well for me at least.Overall, Avatar: The Way of Water was a solid movie and entry into the 2022 filmography. 8/10."
"I'd seen the mixed reviews, but really wanted to make up my own mind. My review, mirrors many others you will have seen. Visually this is 11/10, one of the most beautiful movies ever made, where the cgi and the real blend where it's very hard to know what's real and what isn't. There are shades of the Abyss, one of my favorite Cameron movies, and the message is an important one. But man, does it take it seriously, and does it ever drag on! There is no reason this story needs over three hours to be told. Even two hours would be stretch for this narrative. And with that, it was hard to really engage or emphasize with the characters. It's a spectacle, but one that only needs one viewing."
"I don't get it. If this is best thing Cameron can come up with after five years of work, I bet a five year old could do better. I can only guess five minutes were spent on the story and script; and the rest on the fx. The film is visually stunning at times, but it can't cover-up the cliched nonsense and lack of substance elsewhere. It's excruciatingly too long and contains the dumbest of characters ever. And he expects us to see more of this? Good grief.... I'd rather invest in a fish tank. Avoid at all cost and just wait for it to be available on a streaming platform. Fortunately I had a nice comfy seat and escaped 30 minutes by dreaming of a nice holiday."
"This film showcases the beauty and complexity of what it is to be human.First off, I love the moral of the story. Which is, treat other beings the way you would like to be treated.Secondly, I was a pescatarian. Until today. I'm going full vegan, because, I no longer want to be part of the narrative, of how we all eat, and consume beings that at one point, had a soul.Overall, I love how James Cameron was able to enhance our experience with both CGI, as well as practical effects. (My preferred approach) I'm so excited to see the other terrains, James chooses to explore in this incredibly unique franchise. James Cameron is truthfully one of the greats. Keep up the groundbreaking work!!"
"First off this is an absolutely stunning-looking film. The CG is out of this world and a true marvel to look at. The CG was flawless with the exception of two or three shots that didn't look terrible but they didn't look right either. I have no quarrels with that as I am highly sensitive when it comes to looking for bad CG. The main problems of the film are that it tries to do too much with a fairly basic story. I counted eight main characters in this film with an additional five secondary characters. I would say at least three of the main characters were completely unnecessary and should have been cut. Of the thirteen characters maybe only two are static. To have eleven different character arcs in a three hour film done well is nearly impossible and it seems like this story would have been better told as a 10-15 episode show on Disney Plus to really give the characters more development and depth. The action scenes were nice but I don't get much out of action scenes. My favorite films explore characters and themes in deeper ways than this film did. Although this film is not bad by any means and I do recommend people to see this, it did not cross the threshold of a good film in my eyes. A lot of people will disagree with me but when you look past the fancy computer graphics at the end of the day a three hour fifteen minute film with thirteen main and secondary characters simply does not work."
"A long time in the making, there was a lot of excitement surrounding this film. I watched it teicw, just so that I could give a balanced review, initially I thought it was terrific, my second viewing exposed some of the film's shortcomings. It's an improvement over the first in terms of CGI and special effects, not that they were bad in the last, but technology has moved on since then, but the plot, that's the issue, it's not as exciting or gripping as it could have been, and it's a little harder to engage and empathise with the characters. It's a little more family drama, as opposed to sweeping Sci Fi epic.Watched 12.12.22
Re watched 12.18.22."
"""The way of the water"", or ""This is the way: water""?The title gives it away: its a Star Wars and Dune rip-off.The main plot of Avatar 1 - going full native - is complete, what could be the new thread? OMG, father-son relations! And give Jake his own Guru: Kiri. The ""Force"" is so strong with the Sullys. The antagonist died in Avatar 1, so lets clone him like Emperor Palpatine! Give the cloned anatagonist a child with unknown mother (Ray) too: Spider.Cameron even pays homage to Dune (which Star Wars riped-off) in a subplot (camouflaged by inverted humidity): the mining of a life elixir, produced by huge non-walking animals, on a wild colony planet.I love Avatar 1, but this movie..."
"Bad guy invades idyllic planet, attacks the good guy, good guy assembles an army and destroys the bad guy's entire heavy fleet using arrows and guns. Oh and the animals pitch in.Good guy comes out on top with only 1 or 2 casualties. Bad guy gets destroyed, until next time.Sound familiar? It's literally the same plot for both movies, except the scenery is different. It's on an island instead of in the forest. So there are watery island people with water animals.I wasn't expecting much but wow, 13 years brought us the same plot with a bigger budget and fancy visuals. The visuals were stunning, as you'd expect from avatar. But I'm curious how they intend to progress the storyline from here. Will it just be the same fight scene in 5 different locations?"
"It has been 13 long years in the making and at 3.5 hours long , what an epic come back. Where to start with the review. This was absolutely visually stunning, much like the first one. I was totally transported back to Pandora and was completely invested. I did how ever get bored for about 10 mins then the action kicked in . The meaning behind this film , like the first, us that humans are greedy and destroy all that is good and pure. The part where they were hunting the whale type creatures absolutely destroyed me and I was sobbing. The thing is, that is what we do to the oceans giants. Again Pandora is partially destroyed , just like we are destroying our planet. The theme of family is strong throughout and the dynamic just works so well. I'm just not sure where they can go with a third one with out it being to repetitive , but only time will tell."
"Ever wondered what it would look like to see a character using signifiers more akin to African and Native American designs (the ink markings, weapons, lifestyle, dreadlocks) shout out in a very clearly American southern accent.... ""Ya Got That, Boy?""How about seeing a white boy have the same signifiers who thinks he's ""one of them"" when he's, by the movie's own logic, a whole other species?If that doesn't make your stomach turn, let's then try and humanize the one villain of the movie because this has to be a damn family film with an easily digestible storyline right?No? Then let's just think about how they (J Cam and team) spent nearly 2 decades trying to come up with a world that still holds the patriarchy (The main family are the Sullys) still features hierarchical tribal systems that are able to connect with the land and be one with it yet always seem to lean towards combat, violence and the glorification of war and warriors.The father son relationship is actually toxic as Jake keeps mumbling how its the father's role to protect (sure buddy, thats all a father is, a bullet shield), his kids keep yelling ""Bro!"" like they're the Island Boys, white boys acting black.BTW, A majority of the actors playing these roles are white. So there's that.Look, the blue aliens in this movie have a saying.....""I SEE YOU""
That should be your only clue to enjoying this mess! Just see it. Do not think about it for even a second because if you do, like me, you'll feel sick."
"Obviously you can have your fun with that kind of popcorn cinema, great visuals, nice fighting scenes, effects etc.But actually the story is quite flat, many stereotypes, common patterns, nothing interesting or suprising.Instead it is sad to see how Cameron fails to present the Na'vi as a a rich, spiritually developed native culture, but instead all the time we see things like teenager drama on an american high school, with mobbing, brawls and a lot of toxic masculinity, very low level. As a positive example for that kind of cultural sensitivity I would call ""Dances with Wolves"" a really good and touching movie, we can see the weaknesses of the invasive western culture compared to a better form of living together, in a authentic community/culture connected with nature.In Avatar 2 all the time basically there is just violence as an answer to everything. It is the basic approach of the old testament, eye for an eye, kill or be killed etc., not really any higher spiritual way or more intelligent solutions.Actually I find it quite abhorrent how Jake Sully treats his own children, virtually using education styles of the 19th century, they have to say ""sir"" to him, act like being in a military unit etc. - Instead of having learned a higher way of a natural, native, spiritual community, his whole family acts like they are modern americans, just living in the woods. It feels totally unrealistic that his Na'vi mate Neytiri and their whole family would become assimiliated by american culture, like we see it. Rather Jake should behave more like spiritually, morally developed native folk, after having lived in the nature, in their clan. Not still acting bascially like a marine with blue skin who is allied with the Na'vi. His slogan that men are (just) for protection is also quite backward and reduces men. E. g. The very important part of showing how to be a ""good"" person, high morale, good values etc., all this loses in favor of simple masculinity. Moreover dialog parts like ""bro"" etc. Sound so unfitting.I find a lot of illogical issues, too. For example the Na'Vi are soul mates of the tulkun (these super intelligent ""whales""), but they accept the murderous activities of ""whale hunters"" as long as it is not in their direct neighbourhood... Na'Vi didn't even try to develop some defense tactics or anything for them, does not sound believable.Enough said... ;-) You can have good fun, with cool action and great effects, but don't expect anything above lower standards regarding story/world/plot/characters."
Dragged out sequel that felt like a three hour trailer for the next one. Some pretty big plot holes that with the amount of money thrown at this should not of been there. Looks pretty but captivating it is not. It will win Oscars for visual work but if if you want to look at art go to a gallery don't go and watch this. If there had been a slightly less predictable story line or any attempt at making the characters have depth and charisma this movie could of been something for me. But it didn't and therefore makes the 3 hours drag on and on. Over hyped 13 years waiting and a story that could of been covered in an hour.
"I just want to gush about this movie really quick. Seeing this movie, while it definitely has its flaws, was the best moviegoing experience I have had since 2019. The grandiosity of the magnificent creatures soaring through the sky and the water, the close up shots of the Na'vi faces being so realistic, making it seem like they are right there, the breathtaking, cutting edge visuals that required new technology being invented just to create, the powerful themes of family, and being an outcast.A common complaint I heard of the first Avatar was that the plot was basic and the characters had no depth. While I don't find this to be true about the first one, it's definitely not true for the second one. Avatar Way of the Water has a much richer story with many different conflicts happening simultaneously, creating an edge-of-your-seat viewing experience. I never knew what would happen next. The 3 hour, 20 minute runtime didn't feel overbearing. Kind of daunting going in, but every minute was used for world building and/or developing characters.I can't get into my complaints, which are few, without spoiling anything. And I don't want to do that. (Mainly that a part of the ending seemed a bit like a cop out, but it also looks like a set up for a big arc in the coming movies, so I don't know where I stand yet.) Not a cinematic masterpiece, but pretty damn close. I also feel like 'Pandora Fever' will be a common epidemic in the coming months. I and everyone I know who has watched this movie desperately wish we could visit Pandora. I urge everyone to give it a shot!"
"Gifted movie tickets. The recipient wanted to watch this, so I obliged. I had very low expectations but figured that the visual effects alone would make it at least be worth a watch. It wasn't. Although parts of the movie looked great and despite the 7 trillion very loud explosions included in this ""movie"", I struggled to stay awake. This wasn't a movie as such. It was a visual effects circle-jerk littered with corny midwit programming.Pros:
Visual effectsGood action scenes (some great bow and arrow + spear kills)Cons:
No plotPoorly written dialogue (Bro, why do the aliens speak like American kids, cuz?)Bad casting (I checked out when I saw Carmela Soprano play some sort of military commander)Bad pacingToo many forgettable charactersWhale-sauceIt's essentially a rollercoaster ride, except it's 3 hours long and made by a committee of environmental and social activists."
"The story is shallow at best. It misses the impact of a dying earth and settling on an alien planet.The whole story is about Jake Sully who is being chased by a team of commando's. It is filled with useless amounts of ""eye-candy"". Which was as entertaining as watching paint dry.Avatar part II is a filler movie, in James master plan for #8 Avatar movies. The Na'vi are a mix of African and Native American people. Who have an overdone expression of their characteristics. Cringy to say the least.Also you get bombarded with messages about whale hunting, climate change and the bond between people and animals."
"The rendering of the aquatic enviroment and the species therein was stunning. If however felt that the story was only a support to showcase the special effects. The overall plot was a re-hash of the first movie. Several important things such as basically abandoning the forest tribe and the near murder of Spidey failed to be addressed. These are goldmines that could help drive the story and show the emotional range of the actors. Instead they spent more time on dear old-fashioned bullying and of course, dealt with it the old-fashioned way. If you like nice screensavers, do watch the movie. Otherwise it will be 3hrs+ of your life that you will never get back."
"As visually immersive as the original Avatar was, this is equally immersive or even more so. And for viewers who didn't think there was a story, did they fall asleep?We got all KINDS of story in this movie, along with a virtually hour long closing action sequence that had me sometimes holding my breath along with the characters.For years I played an MMORG called World of Warcraft. It's been around almost 20 years so most people have heard of it by now. I found myself wishing this sort of visual technology could be applied to a virtual world like that. The detail, the beauty, and the movement is all just perfect. If you can't sit back and enjoy this movie, I don't know what to tell you.And back to the story. There are parts which are very hard to take. It's not My Little Pony. You get sacrifice, coming of age, youthful angst, assimilation, forged friendship ... and oh yeah ... bad guys who are REALLY bad.It's a great film and a great story."
"I gave it 3 stars out of generosity because some visuals are really pretty but overall the story is almost nonexistent, stretched at least an hour and a half too much just to show off the effects with many cringy dialogues and moments. And those visuals aren't really anything new, I've seen such pretty scenes on Planet Earth that were all real. It was a fun 4D experience for the first hour or so. It's definitely too long it ends up boring. Characters are poorly written and you don't root for any of them much, so much so that the emotional scenes aren't very touching either. Hugely overrated and overpriced ticket. Would not recommend."
"Just nooo... rushed...not finished as it should be....sorry...no!!First it gives a fairy tale facsimile to the things we already have and we are loosing as we speak...1 billion could save that.....do the children or parents even know that all of the animals are based on creatures alive now... beeing on a much smaller scale, but nevertheless there...
Second, the story line has no constancy. Rushed as I said before... it could be soo much more..
Also there where so many spaceships landing on the moon but only a few were there dealing with the ""threat"" of the natives....again, natives...wtf...Three.... people eat too much popcorn
Thank you and good night."
"Visuals: 10 out of 10
Story: 1 out of 10
Acting: 2 out of 10
Dialogue: 0 out of 10I do not care about how much effort went into this movie or how everyone talks about the ground breaking CGI. Why do we need films like Avatar? It is dull, long and boring.When it comes to a real deep cinematic experience we need more than just CGI. What about the story? What about the acting? What about the dialogue? Avatar 2 displays what in my opinion is wrong about film making today: all focus and money goes into CGI - all other important areas are neglected. I want to see Sigourney Weaver in real life and not as a blue animated teenage creature. It makes me sad in which direction the movie industry is heading.That is why Avatar 2 is as good as Sharknado - just with a 350 Million budget.Greetings from Vienna."
"There are certain movies that should only be enjoyed in the cinemas for the full experience. Avatar - The Way of Water is one of those movies. Normally big budget mainstream commercial movies are loaded with CGI and we can tell when it's CGI heavy as well. James Cameron is a league of his own when it comes to science fiction action genre movie making. The attention to detail when it comes to character motion and facial capture is magnificent. The underwater scenes mind blowing. It's a long movie yes and probably could have been a bit shorter in its runtime but my teenage daughter, my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie experience and we shall certainly watch the upcoming sequels in the theater 3D 4DX Experience the same way as we did The Way of Water. Take a bow James Cameron (one of a kind movie making genius) 👍🏾👍🏾"
"The VFX was amazing! Full marks for the VFX team!But where the heck is the story?! This crap is the best what James Cameron could come up with?!I'm not sure if I just watched the sequel of the highest grossing movie of all-time or a National Geographic documentary on Pandora's ocean life!Every single person from the first movie who died: Stephen Lang to Sigourney Weaver, still resides in the Avatarverse in one form or the other.And, clones?! Seriously... there's no better person on the entire Earth who could bring down Jake Sully other than the clone of the guy who failed to do so in the first place?! Man, R. I. P logic!Watch it for the VFX, if you want. But, that's pretty much it."
"As a youngster I was obsessed with director James Cameron's films. I watched ""Aliens"" well over 100 times and this is not hyperbole. It was the quintessential movie that threw everything at the screen and dared you to compare it to the more bleak predecessor. It couldn't be compared, because that's who he is. Having dropped him from my list of directors I'd be first in line to see after the meandering ""Titanic"" I finally watched a more modern Cameron.The problem with him is he isn't necessarily full human. He is a replica of one. Knows the emotional beats because that's what the template wants him to do. Otherwise, he is buried under the technology that he wants to break in future projects. He doesn't care about people. They are obvious caricatures of what people are suppose to be. Witness the failed Edward Furlong interacting with a Terminator. Absolutely cringey today. Or the cold lack of intimacy between Jack and Rose in ""Titanic"". The corny lines don't stop. But NO ONE tells Iron Jim.He also has a great impression of caring about humanity. He doesn't care. He does know he's suppose to, because his generation (boomer) requires that he does. It's an arrogance that permeates his movies. This is no different. It is a practically perfect rendition of feelings and relationships foisted upon blue people (Native Americans or Maori folk). In this, it is about whaling. Or whatever they're called here. Having spent decades going deep deep DEEP into the sea, Cameron is determined to lecture us on how we are destroying HIS planet.So we get ""Avatar"". The next installment of how humans suck and things that look like humans don't. What is the real lesson here? Family (go ""Fast And Furious""!). They say it ""Sullys stick together"" Eye roll. And it's not like I don't like schmaltz. In fact I love it. It's that Cameron is horrible at it. The world he builds doesn't necessarily require that he pile it on so thick. And there are moments where we see what he is setting up for, when it comes to one of the sons. Without giving too much away.Avatar is a fantastic world built on great imagination. But I can't imagine Cameron telling it around a fire with that must zest. Without the bells and whistles of painfully aware computer graphics, the story is bits and pieces of better movies. Sometimes better versions of his OWN movies. And it boils back down to the basics again. Why are the humans who've ruined their own planet spending so much more time and corporate cash to terraform another one? If you want, you could see it as what LV-426 was prior to colonization of terraformers In ""Aliens"" Another perspective told from the xenomorphs point of view. Ugh.The movie is engaging in its visuals. Late afternoon warm environments make you feel like when ""Far Cry"" games start to lean towards dawn. The beauty is constructed through far off water lands or deep jungles. It's a place many humans WOULD want to inhabit. But not many would survive.I do applaud Cameron for attempting to get closer to humanity. He has moments between children and parents that ring rather true. Though with the impending doom of invaders, we know the story won't spend much time in tranquility.Overall, the movie isn't bad, it just was un-necessary if only to show you the possibilities of computer generated worlds."
"Did I miss something at the beginning, were old characters grown again? Pay attention I tell myself.The film starts with Avatars, the baddies I will call them, going back to take the goodness from where they tried before.It becomes a hut of Jake Sully who I can not get a young Mel Gibson out of my mind when ever he is on screen.Baddies invade, Jake and family move away as they know they are ten target to protect their clan. Moving in with another clan just moves the focus and area of attack.New clan does not really want them, Romeo and Juliet influences happen of course.Nice underwater shots, they learn how to use their breath better to stay underwater longer.Baddies turn up, lots of fighting scenes, of which I am pleased to learn that they were shortened.Goodies win, the world is at peace."
"I loved the first Avatar movie, it was visually beautiful and storyline was spot on...
Storyline? There didn't appear to be a storyline except a weak revenge plot. The humans returned, they recreated the consciousness of the previous characters.. for revenge? Somehow Sigourney had a baby? And then Spider was the baby of the corporal? When did that happen? And then they ran and are now water babies? I mean... what? I don't get it... 3hrs12 minutes of my life... visually it was a beautiful film, but just lacked substance and storyline. It just really didn't meet expectation and flew over major parts which would of made the movie so much smoother...."
"Having seen the first Avatar movie, I went into this one knowing what to expect. TBH, I wanted to see the sequel based on the reviews of the special effects. The CGI and action scenes are worth going to a theater to experience the full 3D effect. This is a gorgeous movie for the eyes, but Avatar: TWOW is not a full movie experience for the adult brain.The Na'vi are back, specifically the Scully family. There is a thin plot of a Colonel who gets implanted into a blue-man body to capture Jake and get revenge for Jake killing him in the 1st movie.This movie does hit you over the head with stereotypes and themes. The natives (Na'vi, get it?) are one with the planet, and in this one even talk to the whales. Ouch. There is not one likeable Na'vi as they are all two-dimensional. And the humans are not any better, the evil Colonel, the pillaging colonial white guys, the military complex bent on stripping the new pristine planet of valuable resources.Then we move on to the water scenes. It is almost like Cameron is showing off here. The scenes are awesome, but they are too long. It is like an episode of Blue Planet meets a video game. The water scenes make this movie 45 minutes too long.Let's move onto the plot issues. So the Na'vi are relatively primitive people, yet they use sat-com headsets and laptops. Last time I looked, Pandora did not have technical support or engineers on the planet.Not sure of the purpose of Spider, and the Scully children who kept getting into trouble started getting on my nerves. As did the simplistic messages about family and fighting for what is yours.All in all, this felt like a movie for the kids, even with the super violent fight scenes. I will probably rent the 3rd installment as long as it clocks in under 2.5 hours, just to see what happens.I suppose those reviewing this above an 8 may be looking at it through a simplistic lens or basing their review mainly on the blockbuster CGI effects. For me, a great movie has to have a strong plot and characters with nuance and depth. The special effects (if any) should not be the driving factor for the strength of the movie itself.On a side note, Sam Worthington's one-note narration gives you insight into the fact that the writers needed this device to explain things since they didn't use plot and character exposition to get the story across."
"I loved the first avatar movie when it come out and since then I've been waiting fascinating the sequel and I really liked but still the technical aspect of using High frame ratio in some scenes is absurd, they should make it all HFR or none, it looks like a pc gaming dropping frames when they change scene that use HFR and it really stop the immersion.The dialogue is not his best on this movie and it remembers like Star Wars A new hope and force awakens, still using the same structure of making the world again after the long hiatus and opening for more avatars.I hope it makes more senses with better dialogue with the futures movies but as a first movie opening the universe once again is astounding. I hope for the best with the next movies."
"If you planned on watching the first movie before watching this one. Don't as you'll enjoy it less. In a nutshell, it's a beautiful movie but as so much nowadays, the story is lacking and is almost exactly the same as the first movie, with the difference that they are out of the woods and into the water. Also, if you enjoy animals telepathically asking ""how are the kids doing"", this is something for you. If you like unbelievable plot armor, this is something for you, if you like a huge military investment that revolves around revenge and involves very lame bad guys, this is for you, if you want to see how amazing and perfect CGI has become, this is also for you."
"And I thought how Interstellar was a visual top ceiling, then I saw Avatar at the revival premiere in the cinema and I was forced to reconsider that opinion somewhat, and today I was at the premiere of the sequel to the twelve-year-old cinematic phenomenon, and I have to make this conclusion about which movie has the best visual to leave open, because this is another step up and is the most beautiful thing that the human eye can see in the cinema and who knows what Jim will come up with in 2 years. But enough about the visuals, there are more of those strengths. As for the music, I miss James Horner, but that doesn't mean I'm dissatisfied, his successor does a respectable job and basically follows similar tones. It's probably the case with the characters that there are a lot of them, but they all work functionally and memorably, that is, with one exception in the form of General Ardmore, she was probably the only one who didn't suit me at all and found me uninteresting, I guess the return of Selfridge would be better. If I had to choose between this or Part 1, in the end I'd probably choose Part 1. Because emotionally it's stronger and generally plays more with emotions, but I can't take points away from the newer one because it's the middle part of the saga and on emotions they usually play the first or last parts, so I have no problem with that here. Of course, James Cameron, as the master of sequels, again did a brilliant job overall as a director. 2. Avatar is a brilliant blockbuster that must be seen by everyone who liked it at least a little. 1. Avatar, those who adore it probably don't need to be reminded."
"Visually stunning this story is the shallowest i have seen in a while.The movie keeps the spectator hooked with a good pace and stunning visuals that's for sure. Other than that, nothing very exciting unfortunately.The story has little if no character development at all. It is the old good against bad without any type of nuances. There is no twists nor revelations.What's even worse is the stereotype of this family and toxic masculinity it tries to sell.Its very easy to see how storytelling has done a much much muuuch better job lately on other art pieces. Such a shame they've spent all that movie on visuals without looking after the story."
"I found it ironic that we have the most technologically advanced CGI I've seen in a movie to date with the moral of the story being that life is about connecting with nature and each other. Hi-Tech visuals telling the viewer you're most free when you free yourself from technology. I've determined that life boils down to an experience of many different emotions and that's exactly what this film delivers. It's a masterpiece for that very reason. I found tears streaming down my face throughout the film: Some of joy; Some sorrow; but mostly because of a desire to feel what it's like to really live authentically in this world, and not the mechanized version of how the-powers-that-be want us to live. James Cameron uses this platform to reach out to people who want more out of life with the character named Lo'ak who is the son of Jake Sully. Lo'ak is hard-pressed to ever listen to authority, and instead follows his heart, and makes tough decisions which he is rewarded for in the long run. This is a message from James Cameron to be brave enough to follow what your heart desires and you'll be rewarded in the end even if you have to fight for it. Avatar captures the human experience to a tee in that people develop tunnel vision around their way of life. Whatever way of life you're used to, it's really hard to imagine it any other way and adaptation is typically like pulling teeth! The one exception to this appears to be Jake Sully who shows us that the power of love and wanting safety for your loved ones is enough to adapt, and evolve in an instant. I can't think of a better script than this one. So poetic. So many layers and depth to it. Definitely the best movie I've ever seen. An obvious 10/10."
"I don't have any dislike for the first Avatar film released in 2009. It was a competent sci fi/action flick with a cool premise and a nice array of exciting action set pieces. It had many negatives however. The characters were paper thin, the dialogue veered between banal and complete cringe, the designs of the creatures and planet of Pandora felt quite derivative despite how nice everything looked and, which has been noted many times before, the story is a straight up reskin of much better films such as Dances With Wolves and Fern Gully. However, despite its many shortcomings, it still managed to rise above them and be mildly entertaining.The same CANNOT be said of its sequel. Wow, what an utter SLOG. This film is a chore to sit through. An endurance test. 3 hours is a long time, but if the film is compelling enough, it can whizz by. Not in this case. The story, which can be written on the back of a fingernail, cannot justify the obscene bum-numbing length. From this point i'll list the pros and cons in bulletpoint form:PROS: -The visuals look lovely as you'd expect. I wouldn't say they are a massive upgrade from the 2009 film, but they certainly dazzle. The 3D as you can expect is absolutely masterful. Not gimmicky, just completely immersive.-Stephen Lang. I won't spoil anything regarding his purpose in this film but he's easily the most fun character in these films, easily. One dimensional to the max, but that's perhaps part of his charm.CONS:-The runtime. The film had no right being this long. It feels padded out and bloated with looooots of filler.-The dialogue. Oh boy, the dialogue. I don't expect every character to speak like a Shakespeare character but come on. Sample quote 'I don't speak English to buttholes'. The bulk of the most offensively bad lines came from Sully's kids who can't go a sentence without saying 'bro' and 'cuz'. Because of course if you're born on a alien planet without access to humans, you'd talk like that(??). Sully doesn't speak like that. Baffling. James Cameron having a 'hey fellow kids' moment.-Unlikeable/boring characters. Never found Jake Sully a particularly engaging character (perhaps a result more of Sam Worthington's pancake-flat wooden performance) and here is no different. At least he had the compelling aspect of being a paraplegic who is now put into a strange body where he has freedom to fully live and move around. Now he's a fully formed Na'avi and that interesting dynamic is all gone. His personality is basically 'i hate humans and love my family'. I was completely passive to him ever being in peril. I detested his stupid annoying children, they were aggressively irritating. Neytiri is still...there. The inhabitants of the new water location are also....there. By the way try and guess the character Kate Winslet plays because i couldn't work it out!. There's a reason Avatar gets a lot of flack for 'having no cultural importance' despite being the biggest film of all time...and it's because the characters are absolutely awful. They all speak the same, look the same, they really really love nature don't you know?? There's no real variety and that's a hindrance.The story. The humans are back and the Na'avi have to move. No, that's it, that's the story. 13 years of writing and that's the best way they could move the story forward.I was completely indifferent to how this film unfurled. A deeply disappointing 2nd entry in the series. Certainly not looking forward to any successive sequels after this. Might check them out on TV but certainly won't be making the effort to drive to the theatre, i don't care if they play it on a screen the size of the Grand Canyon.I've seen people declaring the film a masterpiece and showering it with praise. They're clearly blinded by the pretty colours because there's nothing behind it all. Sorry, i'm not so easily fooled. All spectacle, no substance. Visually mindblowing, narratively braindead 4/10."
"Cameron spent many years allegedly developing the technology to deliver a masterpiece of cinematography. He succeeded.First, why the movie is not getting a 9 or 10 star rating. Simply put, the plot does not deliver anything new. We have a classic tale of foreigners exploiting a new land for its resources. The natives oppose the harvesting of their resources and fight back. Sound familiar? Yes, that was the plot of Avatar 1. The script is well written and the actors all deliver phenomenal performances.That said, the banality of the plot does not detract from the cinematographic masterpiece Cameron delivers. First, the avatar CGI was phenomenal. Particularly Sigourmey's character. You can really see her face in her ""daughter."" Quite impressive. And then there was the main feature: the water scenes. Cameron manages to capture live action underwater shots using advanced film tech (and very dedicated actors).Watch this movie if you're looking to be amazed by cinematography. Do not look for a deep meaning in the plot. But it is very enjoyable for what it is and moves the CGI ball forward."
"First for the obvious it is visually stunning. The CGI is just amazing. The under water scenes feel like you are in the water with the characters. Now for the disappointment. The story doesn't work. The whole moving your consciousness to another being is poorly conceived. Also how can a dead avatar have a baby. As the critical drinker would say ""don't know"". The theater was packed with kids I. Er it was great for the parents to discuss the nude breasts with nipples showing on the drive home. I saw some families walk out. Don't see why it took 13 years for this to come out with all the delays. At this point I will be able to retire before part 3 comes out."
"James Cameron has done it again. He placated us with beautiful CGI world-building to help compensate for two hours of minimal plot and character development followed by a predictable overdrawn 1-hour showdown between uncomplicated good vs. Evil characters.The protagonists' vulnerabilities? Moral ambiguity? Complex characters who are neither good nor bad but somewhere in between like real people?No.This type of movie, once common, recalls the cliche all-American movies of the early 2000s: It's centered on a nuclear family led by a smooth-talking stoic hero dad who risks everything to save his family, the fate of the world hanging in the balance.Difficult outcomes? Heavy losses? A challenging ending? Of course not.Miraculously the protagonists' primtive bow-and-arrow calvary take down an futuristic high-tech military fleet and yay happy ending!Luckily this time around we aren't made to sit through a sappy predictable Pocahontas love story like in the first Avatar movie, presumably thanks to prudent editors who amputated a budding love story sub-plot foreshadowed in the first half of the movie but never carried to completion.In sum, the movie is worth seeing only because it's pretty, but expect to lose some brain cells along the way."
"I think this is the first time that I've left a review on here, though that might not be accurate. I had to put in my two cents, though it will be short. If I have to read one more time that this film had the most amazing visual effects ever I will lose my mind. You want visual effects? Watch Dragonslayer. Watch The Empire Strikes Back. This is not visual effects. This is some nerds behind computers playing around with ones and zeros. Brains, sure. But actual masters of visual effects? 100% absolutely not. It just amazes me that there are so many that are saying that this is a masterpiece. That it is James Cameron's greatest film ever. I can't believe what a huge disappointment this film was, in every respect."
"I want to live in Pandora.it's always jar in my head when I watch the first part and that's how I felt. The first part may have been a bit more reasonable than the second but the action scenes were much better than the first file. The right question is, was it worth going on for almost a decade and a half for this movie? Well maybe the legitimate answer may not be but personally worth waiting for many many years for this movie.perhaps the film was slightly tuned to the children, starring the navik children more, but it was compensated by the many action scenes and the appearance of the new tribe."
"It wasn't a bad movie actually. For example, the visual effects were simply great, but the plot, for example, was too long, making it pretty boring.I think the previous film was better, for example, in that I think the plot was a bit more interesting. The plot of the previous movie was quite similar to it, which I think was also a mistake. It wasn't very original in that way.The characters were pretty good (but sometimes there were some things I didn't understand about them, like the decisions they made, ect.).In summary, it's not a bad movie, but it's weak in things like the plot. The visual effects, on the other hand, were truly lifelike and amazing."
"A blockbuster beauty. Smell the smells, taste the ocean, feel the waves and the air of Pandora as you immerse yourself into this magnificent scene. James Cameron has once again delivered an epic experience to the world, thanks to 20th Century Fox and now Disney for trusting in his vision, we have the privilege to say we lived in this era of storytelling.Titanic, Avatar, Alita, Terminator, and now Avatar 2 will be added to the record books. If you are questioning whether to see it, STOP QUESTIONING, and go see it. IMAX 3D is the best format, along with Dolby digital 3D. If you have a 4D theatre that's even better.There's no question that each and every inch of this film was carefully crafted for the audience to enjoy. It's jam packed with awe-inspiring beauty in every frame, heart pounding action scenes, but unfortunately a lacking narrative with a stagnant plot. However, even with these shortfalls, the visuals far make up for it. 10/10."
"I had the hope that the movie would have the same strong storyline like the first one. I felt immediately in love with Pandora and her surroundings. The storyline was strong and the characters were so well made. They have their own language, habits, believe, etc. It made the storyline stronger.. I was really excited for this new part. I had the hope they made me fall in love, once again.Unfortunately . They didn't. Everything was still really well visualized. Wherever you look you saw something what goes behind your imagination.But, I didn't fell in love once again. The storyline was really weak, Everyone who was dead but lives again.. Seriously? Why? The Na'vi's didn't spoke their own languages but the language of the 'devil people'. Also: Sam Sully spoke to his sons not like a dad, but still like a mariner. Why? Why so American? He had changed, he became a Na'vi. Show us that. Show the warmt like the first movie.One of the two things I was really annoyed was that the kids the whole time said bro. I mean BRO? WHY? They are na'vi. Let them speak Navi. I find it strange. The second thing was the war on the water they stood there with a complete Navi army. But on a certain point they vanished. Where did they go? Why did the partens of Tsireya just let her daughter fight alone? Mom looked like to care more about her Whale. It's all about community but they did't show us that.. For me was it just a classic war movie but nicely dressed up.."
"Avatar: The Way of Water is meant to be a triumphant return for James Cameron, and proof that Avatar can be the cultural milestone it promises to be, but it doesn't change anything. Other than some intriguing subplots, it's basically the first movie again in a new setting. I have no idea what Cameron spent the last decade of development on these movies doing, because the script is still shallow, the dialogue is still cringey, and the overall quality of the visual effects are somehow a step down from the first film. All that said, Payakan is the G. O. A. T. and his exile is a great injustice. I give The Way of Water a middling 6/10. It's a disappointment for sure, but at the end of the day I don't think Cameron could make a truly bad film if he tried.QyrosMovies."
"I'll admit some CGI improvements over the past decade, but they don't make for a good movie in terms of scripting and acting. For the overall message, Avatar keeps reiterating the same old stereotypes: nature is good, the white man is bad. Blues, greens, and virtually all other colors and species of all sizes are innocent and friendly. What makes white people so ugly? Greed, lack of empathy. So you can follow the rest of the consequences along a flat script with flat characters and some minor parentage issues (x is a child of y, and that creates a conflict. Have you heard of that before?).The movie is long because CGI costs seem to have come down, so things you could explain most vigorously in 5 minutes run for an hour, iterating over and over again ad nauseam fast camera movements and details that mar any sense of realism and participation.Warning: If you plan to watch this movie in a 4DX theater, be prepared to sail in a small boat in a heavy storm for three hours. Watching Avatar 2 in a 4DX theater is the worst experience I've ever had in a movie theater. All the problems seen in Top Gun 2 are made worse and multiplied by the continuous and violent movement of the seats, which makes it impossible to maintain an upright position. About halfway through the movie, you'll probably start wishing all the characters (white, blue, and green people alike) were dead and the end credits start rolling. Virtually every person ended up feeling dizzy on their way out. A real torture.And no. Despite all the CGI improvements, you can still feel yourself watching colorful silly Tom & Jerry cartoons."
"I've seen the original many times over and this movie just seemed reuse anything and everything that made the original film special. I was seriously hoping to see something that made the film stand apart. Don't get me wrong though. The film is beautiful and really shows how far technology has come in the past decade. It got to the point where I didn't care if I needed to go to the restroom during the film because I knew I wouldn't be missing something that I hadn't seen before. I guess my expectations were a little too high. Unfortunately, I expect this trend to continue in future Avatar movies."
"The Visuals were gorgeous as expected with a lot of detail and great motion and chase sequences. The plot was decent but it should not have taken that long to develop you can probably cut an hour out of this film and still have a decent movie. It seemed like a mix of a bunch of movies i have seen before with nothing really amazing other than visuals. Yes it was nice to have new characters, creatures and landscapes but it also felt too much like a video game and at times i was really bored and wanted to walk out. It could have gone straight to streaming i would have enjoyed it just as much, maybe more. Not really worth the money or wait."
"Forget what some of these Muppets who don the professional critic name. Most of them are well out of touch. This is a proper cinema blockbuster, one worthy of paying money to watch on the big screen. 3 hours and 12 minutes dissapreared in a heartbeat. The absolutely stunning visuals will keep you glued and will leave you with some absolutely WOW! Moments that you won't forget.The Forrest in Pandora in the first film was stunning, wait until you see the water world of Pandora in this. It blows you away, I had fond memories of the first film having watched that in the cinema and now my young one will have fond memories for many years to come of this brilliant film. James Cameron nails character development, action scenes and making a 3 hour movie dissapear very quickly.I watched the movie and thought afterwards this can't be anything other than a 9/10 then read some critics' reviews and thought to myself they watched the wrong film. If you ever read a Guardian review then do the opposite as it will stand you in good sted.Don't think about it, take your kids, take your family and enjoy a proper blockbuster thrill ride that you won't want to end! Cannot wait for the next one!"
"3+ hours and nothing happens except for some CGI and lots of sad drama.. which felt completely empty.Please have some character development so we care about them. All felt boring predictable and feeling less.I can play games for some cool CGI. But I go to Cinema to feel emotions, be at edge of my seat and get surprised by unexpected twists. Nothing was there.Will avoid this at all costs. Even Avengers look like much interesting Infront of this.Please stop producing 3+ hours of movies with actually nothing in them.Disappointment overall. Waste of time and money.Part one was better. Not much better but much more interesting."
"The movie get 5/5 for the visual and 0/5 for the storyline so it get a 5/10 overall. If the director has spend 1/10 of the time on writing a better story and dialogs, it wont be so torturing to watch. :(
However, if you gonna watch it, probably should watch it in a imax cinema in 3D. Again I need to re-emphasis that the story is absolute dull, it could have been a master piece grabbing all the awards out there. The movie is like 3 hours plus, and there's a lot of ads included, so you are looking at like a 4 hours commitments.I run out of popcorns like within the first hour, and in the second hour there's like a line outside the bathrooms already."
"Visually stunning cash grab garbage. I wish they made movies where as much effort was put into the script as in the CGI extravaganza.Still, worth watching in IMAX 3D, take away 3D and you're left with a generic, unnecessary long nonsense plot. On a bright side, I appreciate the music score.But i must admit, the best thing about watching the new Avatar (which really should be called ""Avatar: the way of crap"") was seeing the exclusive trailer for the new Mission Impossible movie :DI liked the first one more, both movies are cliche packed American super productions where the script is written to appeal to the broadest possible audience, which often boils down to being anchored in stereotypes and all the movie tricks you've seen over the last 30 years in Hollywood scipts.So, to summarize - visually stunning garbage, but fun experience in 3D and I'll never rewatch it in 2d (because seriously, why?)."
"Just came home from the cinema watching this, And i would say to everyone, just watch animal planet in HD, you will spend your time better then watching this movie. SOOOOOO DISAPOINTED. It lacks everything, this is a story about a family has nothing to do with AVATAR. So i wouldnt spend a single dime on this movie. Every episode of GOT was better then this crap i just saw.Even Jason Bourne movies was better then this. And that say's alot.We where 5 people going to the cinema and every single one of those did not come out and said wow that was awesome. Just the opperset.So save your money, do not watch this in the cinema, wait atleast until will come on netflix or HBO."
"Special effects are good but not a quantum-leap, some video games today are honestly even more impressive with more diverse landscapes (Horizon, Elden Ring). The story is really underwhelming as the characters are all one-dimensional and the themes and plots totally predictable. It is also way too long for such levels of shallow content. My friend and I even fell asleep in the cinema. I would almost recommend the movie for family with kids if there weren't some quite violent scenes.Part 1 was also cheesy but more mature in terms of the themes and character development/arcs.If you want to watch some nice graphics and don't want to buy a playstation 5, then the movie could be a good choice. For everyone else, skip this one."
"Although the visuals in the movie were stunning, the film felt too long and I lost interest at one point. Additionally, the plot felt repetitive and unoriginal, as it seemed like a copy-paste of the first movie with the discovery of a new part of Pandora. The use of both 48fps and 24fps scenes also detracted from the film, as the mixing of the two frame rates made it feel like a poorly optimized game. Overall, I was disappointed with the movie and don't plan on seeing the next one in theaters. It seems like the franchise should have ended with the first movie, but the filmmakers were more interested in making more money."
"TLDR: It's basically a load of tall blue dudes with cat tails talking English in African tribal accents and hissing at each other likes cats... (way too much) against fantasy world backdrops. The End.Long version...
I'd recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen other movies just so the ideas and plot devices all seem fresh.The adventure is cheesy and predictable but the action scenes are well sequenced and you can forgive the rampant cheese on the grounds that it's a family movie.The CGI seemed to have advanced very little since the last outting. And the IMAX 3D I thought was surprisingly weak and underutilized. I was hoping that any dumbed-down storytelling might at least be propped up by stellar 3D but it was disappointing on that front too.I'm giving this a 4 stars because work clearly went into it and I know underappreciated CGI artists must have worked tirelessly to make all the assets as they do for these kinds of movies.Given that I'd heard quite a bit of hype over this production along the lines of ""best movie I've ever seen"" and similar, I had high hopes. My experience was a long way from best movie ever and I really think now, more than ever, James Cameron peaked with Aliens back in 1986."
"Feel like I keep writing the same review over and over again. Another great movie in every way but story line. When will Hollywood start doing movies with great scripts again?The script seems like an afterthought in this movie. Throw together a little Moby Dick, a little Poisidein Adventure and maybe a few chapters of Mutiny on the Bounty and here you go.No new ground here. Maybe they should try ChatGPT next time they need a storyline and save the time and cost of a writer. The characters are flat and predictable. There are no memorable lines that will become part of everyday language.If you are looking for 3 hours of stunning visual effects this is your movie. If you need a story held to the same standards, look elsewhere."
"The only reason I am giving this movie 5 stars, is because of the cinematographic experience. I was looking forward to see more of the world of avatar and I was not disappointed. I was disappointed in the lack of a story and how the characters were setup and developed. Pandorans were different from humans in the first movie, but in the second they act just as annoying. What was that whole middle part with the blend and very annoying children who had to perform some high-school drama? There were so many more possibilities to show us Pandora then through the eyes of a bunch of humanoid rascals of which no-one gets a 3D character development. All of the children were expendable.I thought it was going to be a movie about people survival, planet vs planet, interplanetary politics, etc. Instead we get a discovery and war videogame with stunning visuals of a fantastical world in which some former killed colonel, back as an avatar, is going crazy on revenge.This is one the biggest movie disappointments I have had. Very sad."
"I'm a fan of the first Avatar, good story, wonderful visuals, etc. Now I came to see the ratings of this second meaningless movie, and right now it's rated higher than the first?! Come on IMBD! You're all out of your minds, or haven't we seen the same movie? The only thing that saves this movie are the special effects, the story seems like it was written by an 8 year old child. Constant situations of: Don't go, but he's going anyway; we're stuck, we're loose, we're stuck again? But what is this? It's not even a question of the length of the film, it's really a lack of content, of meaning, of excitement, NOTHING, it's dead! Give me a break! And there is more of this to come? James Cameron, wake up, Avatar deserves better!"
"Incredibly beautiful to look at, there are zero complaints when it comes to the visuals or cinematograpy in Avatar: The Way of Water. The faults lies, unsurprisingly, in its story which at this point feels like it should be going somewhere instead of repeating stuff from the first film. On the plus side, it tells a traditional story about family and the central figure (Jake) takes the role of a loving and protecting father which is actually quite rare to see done right in a Hollywood film these days. There are some interesting new concepts presented such as the character of Kiri, but it feels like the mystery surrounding her is saved for a later film.With the positives out of the way, let's move on to the negative stuff.Length: The length is not a problem per se because there are plenty of three-hour movies that feel engaging and exciting from start to finish. The Way of Water, however, did not need to be 3 hours and 12 minutes long, and they could have easily cut 30 minutes of ""Jake and his children marvel at Pandora's nature"" and still have lots of beautiful nature scenes left. This would have given the film a much better flow and feel more cohesive in its structure.Lack of human perspective: The humans are given too little room in the story and their strategies lack any form of logic. Although the story focuses on Jake and his family and not the humans, the film spends a maximum of 5 minutes explaining how and why the humans have returned to Pandora. It needed way more exposition to get a better picture of the political and military situation with the humans. I get that some of this might also be saved for a future film, but the severe lack of exposition really hurts the story in this one.Humans don't feel like a threat: It's mind-blowing how useless the humans are at fighting in this film, which means that you never see the humans as a threat to the Na'vi's existence. I'm not exaggerating when I say that this is a film where the humans are completely slaughtered by the Na'vi, they are completely useless and get constantly beaten over and over again. I think I saw perhaps two or three random Na'vi die in the background, while there are at least 20-30 quite graphic scenes where humans are slaughtered and dying to the left and right. The first film didn't have a great story either, but at least the humans felt like a strong threat. This film just feels like a human slaughterhouse.Miles as a character doesn't work: There is zero explanation given as to why it's so damn important for this new Na'vi version of Miles to hunt down and kill Jake, when there are literaly thousands of other tribes on Pandora with their respective leaders that would be capable of making resistance against the humans. If it's nothing but a personal vendetta that Miles has against Jake, it should have been explained in a better way because there is no logical reason for this new Miles to be given endless of financial support and military assistance to hunt down and kill just 1 single Na'vi. What makes this plotline falter further is the realization that the new Miles only has memories from before his arrival to Pandora, which means that he doesn't have memories of ever meeting Jake - So why does he hate him so much? I tell you why, because the plot says so.Overall, not a bad film, but pretty mediocre in terms of storytelling and world-building. This is clearly a movie to be enjoyed for its incredible visuals. Hopefully, the story will improve in the upcoming sequels."
"Although the visuals in the movie were stunning, the film felt too long and I lost interest at one point. Additionally, the plot felt repetitive and unoriginal, as it seemed like a copy-paste of the first movie with the discovery of a new part of Pandora. Also very little new things are introduced for a 3 hours long movie, we already discovered the Navi, Pandora, the ability to use Avatars and the bad guys in the first movie. I was disappointed with the movie and don't plan on seeing the next one in theaters. It seems like the franchise should have ended with the first movie, but the filmmakers were more interested in making more money."
"After a decade of waiting, I finally got to see this visual masterpiece last night in Sydney. And when I say visual, that's all I could say was the positive.For all its shortcomings, I thoroughly enjoyed the first film. Yes the dialogue was flat, uninspired and derivative. But I feel it landed as a whole, and I actually cared for the characters.With The Way of Water, the script and characters are even more dumbed down to the point of insulting my intelligence. I know Cameron wants to hit his 4 quadrant demographic, but my god. This feels like a first pass draft in comparison to the first film.My biggest issue is, if I can't connect to the characters and story, and there are waaaaaay too many characters in this film, then the film (as spectacular as it is) umrimately fails for me.And this film failed with my 3hr + engagement.The 3D HFR is also a major complaint I have. Just keep it all in HFR. It was so distracting watching it bounce back and forth between 24/48 frames per second. It just doesn't work and constantly takes you out of the film. I actually think the HFR works especially in 3D. I didn't get any of that soap opera effect.I'm watching it again tonight in 3D HFR again. Will make my final judegement after this screening. Hopefully as I know what to expect, I can maybe enjoy this visual ride."
"I absolutely loved it and was thoroughly absorbed by the richness of the world. Honestly, I didn't want a complicated story, there's way enough sensory information going on to deal with as it is. I loved it. Perfect escapism. Dream-like sci-fi. Fair enough if it's not for everyone, but I for one was totally enthralled. This is all about the experience, there's plenty of films out there which are all about the script and story but this is different. Totally different. Refreshing to experience a whole new thing. I thought it was heart-pounding, eye-popping fantasy executed with mind bending creativity. I can't wait for the next one. Wish this one had been longer."
"The story makes no sense.. it's painfully long (3hrs+.. half was enough..) it's constantly overflowing with clichés and weak, cheesy scenes and dialogues.. clearly it's just a product designed to give movie theaters something to show on their 3D and 4DX rooms.. (do not try to watch it on 4DX, it's just ridiculously annoying..). I could have forgiven all the commercial and nonsense side of it and enjoy the scenery.. if it wasn't for the completely unnecessary, unjustified and constant violence towards animals.. why oh why do they need to do that? Why hunting whales, why so much detail, what makes it so necessary for the plot to display all that free nonsense violence..!? It's just trashy and ridiculous.. basically it's a movie designed for the most basic spirits that enjoy constant action and some violence.. sadly we know which country is mostly into that.."
"What can I say?From 2009...Upto this point today. It is truly a beautiful journey!!!Hasn't disappointed me in any way. From the beginning, upto the last part. Love, joy and grief.Greed and exploitation.Entertainment and educational at the same time. Truly a masterpiece.If you are thinking of whether or not to watch, take my words and experience the emotional journey I underwent.And yes, Pandora is beautiful, magnificent and truly out of this world.As the title hints, The Way Of the Water... It's a new journey to protect what's most precious as well as treasuring what you already have.Just Go and Watch."
"Movie has mesmerising visuals but the story has no logic.I don't understand why the whole army was chasing right from the beginning of the movie, wasting all their weapons and resources- just to satisfy the bad guy Colonel's (or Major or whatever his rank) ego.Did I miss something in this movie or has Zero thinking gone into making this plot.4 stars is only for the great graphics and visuals and it was a treat to watch in 3D.But 3 hours and 10 mins of enjoying only great graphics was real murder!I believe it is also poor story telling to come up with the idea of Jake and family fleeing the forest home, leaving his fellow people to exposed to the possible attack of the soldiers.It would have made sense if they moved with all his people to new territory to protect his people."
"DO NOT SEE THE HFR VERSION.The movie was great, full of tropes and cliches, but enjoyable nonetheless. If you liked the first one, you will like this one as well.However, the framerate of the HFR version jumps randomly from 24 to 48 fps and back again every couple of seconds, even within the same shot. It is EXTREMELY jarring. My gf didn't even notice or knew what I was talking about, but for me, there was zero immersion as I kept waiting for the ""framerate drop"" every other scene.Shoot the d*mn movie in either 24 or 48 fps, don't keep switching from one to the other literally every 20 seconds, I have absolutely no idea how such a version could have been greenlit. Do not watch the HFR version, go 24 fps and save yourself all this frustration."
"Nothing about this movie surprises you, challenges you as a viewer or makes you feel anything past 'look at the pretty'. My guess is it's a victim of multiple writers coming in and sucking all the soul out of a script.The final fight is entirely too long and is just a revolving door of people getting stuck/ captured(+ has some plot inconsistencies)The children stuff literally is a beat for beat remake of any movie about a family moving to a new town, you have the bully characters who learn to respect the bullied, the love interest with no chemistry, the shy outcast and it's just boring. I just don't understand how or why it's in a avatar film if you could take the same dialogue and put it in contemporary Earth and the difference is negligible."
"I expected it to be beautiful and I was hoping for a good scifi story. Unfortunately it was only about 10% scifi, the rest was family drama. Kids not doing what they are told, and the parents have to clean up the mess. Redundant bad guy story, seen it before. Feels like I have seen this story many times before. The actors were amazing and it was entertaining. There were geat and exciting battle scenes and beautiful visuals, but not feeling inspired in the end. I just feel like I watched a pretty movie with beautiful blue creatures. I was hoping for more scifi and a deeper and more meaningful story."
"Avatar 2 has, as with many film sequels, fallen short of its super-grossing predecessor. And with so much (beautiful) CGI it's now verging on an animated cartoon.This is a 192-minute rehashed Frankensteinian mishmash of Avatar 1, Pocahontas, Blackfish, Dances with Wolves, Titanic and a dash of Greta Thunberg's brand of moralising environmentalism which since 2009 has become done to death, seemingly unbeknownst to Cameron.Furthermore, uncharacteristic terms like ""bro"" and ""dude"" are thrown around by blue aliens in a surprising display of American teenage locker room talk on a (supposedly) far-flung and mysterious exoplanet.All of this is stitched into the sparse and frankly dull story of the Sully Na'vi entourage taking their guerilla refuge in the archipelagic ocean frontier of Pandora.This all transpires after the camo-donning bootcamp-earthling-army-soldiers make a surprise star-warsy comeback, glimpsing best-laid plans for a roughshod off-world colonial resettlement plan (Bridgehead City); and meanwhile deploying a vietnam-esque search and destroy avatar taskforce to take Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) out of the picture.This is headed by the now-blue, ever-macho, and much more lanky ""recombinant"" Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) whose avatar handily retains his signature buzzcut, just so you still know it's him. Other avatars and Na'avi alike blend together into a samey blue background of trilling indigenous shtick and uncanny valley; as if half of them are fresh out of the stupor of a gap-year Ayahuasca ceremony.Sci-fi legend Sigourney Weaver's brilliance is wasted on wide-eyed Kiri, who gawps more than she talks.Quaritch's annoying slightly feral mowgli-like son, known as Miles, or ""Spider,"" (Jack Champion) is one of the only live-action human faces in the film. He possesses an outta pocket knack for giving baddies the slip in multi-million dollar military environs just so the plot can progress. He also growls and hisses occasionally, but otherwise talks normally. Spider has been taken into Jake Sully's obnoxious pretendian Elizabeth-Warren-pretensions. Case in point; Sully smugly referring to humans ""sky people"", when Sully himself was formerly a human.A promising new character emerges in Edie Falco's General Frances Ardmore, but her screen time was brief meaning Quaritch quickly upstages her.Unfortunately, this film didn't make rip-roaring Poseidon waves, rather it mustered a splash in a lukewarm paddling pool. In 2022, with the cultural zeitgeist of 2009 long since shifted, Avatar is a fish out of water.6.4/10."
"Dang. I know a lot of people probably enjoyed the movie, but I was pretty disappointed after watching Avatar 2 (despite its beautiful visuals, anti-imperialism/explotation reflective themes, and intended Indigenous homage), at least after having personally loved the original Avatar film so much.However, having originally been so excited and hopeful for this sequel movie before watching it-yet while also having heard some criticisms of the film, and also negative responses from Indigenous people who had disliked the movie and the Indigenous representation and themes done by it-my biggest complaints with James Cameron's Avatar 2 are these, despite loving some of his other movies.1) White Saviorism, thanks Mr. Jake Sully - one solid criticism I wondered about before watching the movie, particularly from seeing other indigenous peoples' criticisms, but definitely the underlying theme of the whole white saviorism of this brilliant random White guy from Planet Earth who was able to come and solve all the Indigenous' problems for them. As in real life has historically been seen countlessly scrutinized about by other more fortunate, non-indigenouous cultures and individuals, and still today seen within indigenous societies and the problems they face.2) Weak Script, ""bro"" - this movie not being as strong as the original Avatar in terms of script writing and plot, and kind of obnoxiously laughable at times (like how many times ""bro"" was probably said in the movie) while the original Avatar did excellent in its execution in its symbolism and themes, and strong plot narrative in comparison.3) Patriarchy and Gender Stereotypes out the wazoo, ""Sir"" - a super patriarchal world, hitting from the leading patriarch, father figure of the protagonist who military-trains his sons to lead and protect the sisters, and only refer to him as ""yes sir"" (only the ""sons""), and the men who coordinate, speak, and lead (from face value) amongst the clan nations. IN SPITE, of badass inclusivity in fight scenes with the women characters, and the one scene where protagonist says, ""Who I'm really afraid of here is the ""spiritual"" (emotions-intouch one obviously) woman, and not the male clan leader"", yet the movie then proceeds to have the women start arguing and the men slide glancing in the back before trying to defuse the ""emotional"" scene unfolding. We had a little bit of a giggle there in the theatre for the audience... also again, besides action scenes and the ""women get super emotional and crying"" scenes, men did not cry, only called each other bro or cool military nicknames, and did much of the plot leading. Also like shi, the hippie daughter character was my favorite, but the other women besides the female wife protagonist, did almost nothing for the movie plot.4) Based on Reflective Indigenous Imperialism & Environmental Exploitation, yet the ""natives"" are jumping around like damn monkeys - indigenous representation (and appropriation), again a big complaint by many, including particularly indigenous movie watchers, was questionable, and other scenes just embarrassing and disrespectful in the movies approach. From originally being created off the basis of reflecting Indigenous cultures and histories in real life that help culminate to create the indigenous people and plot of the franchise. From the ongoing conversation debate of the very obvious reference of Afro/Indigenous hair dreadlocks being used by white characters; to this one aspect of the film that got me, the constant scenes I'm sitting there wondering, ""Why tf are the Indigenous natives jumping around and crawling looking like monkeys, hissing their teeth like savage animals, and hooting in more so inaccurate fashions than some traditional Indigenous linguistics, but instead sounding like some scene from ""Planet of the Apes"" and coming off as just a laughable, classic Western-percieved mockery at times.5) Boo Yah, Let's Go Soldier Culture - militant culture in this film was, contrary to the original film I felt, seemed more glamorous and ""hollywoodized"" for ""badass"" action sequences and cool effects. In spite of the disgusting whole film's theme of the imperialism and colonialism of this (Western) foreign people, and their hyper-masculine, machismo military ""bombing tf out of everything green and different to themselves"" culture.6) Swear to God, I don't remember seeing one Black person - diversity casting was lacking (despite this franchise, at least original movie, being so progressive in its themes and topics). Besides a VERY few Afro/Indigenous voice acting you can hear and who were casted, all the ""foreigners"" crew in the movie were even more predominantly White than the first film... however, that could be argued as reflecting the nature of Western, more White imperialism and colonization of Indigenous lands and genocide as seen in history, that are again some of the film franchise's biggest themes it reflects and was based on."
"I have always felt that James Cameron was a hallow director. He makes great visual effects but always combines them with really bad screenplays with some of the worst dialogue ever put to paper.Terminator 2 check, True Lies, check, Titanic, check, Avatar, check, all have two things in common, great visual effects and corny screenplays..I'm sorry to say that Avatar 2, also known as the Way of Water is no different. It is simply a direct rip off of the original movie, but this time most of the storyline/action takes place in the ocean.James Cameron even rips himself off in the process this time, with elements of Terminator 2, The Abyss, and Titanic in the hokey ending.They storyline is paper thin, the characters uninteresting and I truly felt that not only was three hours of my time wasted but so was $22 to see the movie.I can honestly say that when the film ended there was a muted response from the audience, no clapping, no cheering, just relief the movie finally ended.This is the third strike out for Caermon in recent times, Alita Battle Angel was a bust as was the latest Terminator film, Dark Fate, both films were co-produced by him. You can add Avatar 2 to that mix as well, I'm sorry to say."
"The dialog in this movie is simply idiotic. The characters are flat, and the world-building is unoriginal and irrelevant to the story.There are about zero reasons to sympathize with the Na'vi, as they seem to be just ""blue humans"" with no special traits, values or principles, other then ""they love their mamma-tree"".It was just as awful as the first Avatar. Had they cut 1-2 hours out, this movie might have been a good action flick.The plot holes and characters that CONSTANTLY have to explain everything (""Bro!"") was annoying and made this feel like a childs book adapted by Michael Bay.This movie was made for people who do not want to think anything for themselves, and it talks down to it's audience by decribing every action and reaction explicitly through hilariously bad dialogue."
"Banal means obvious and boring.Outside of the amazing 3D effects which is quite immersive, and definitely worth the price of admission, expect everything else to leave you bored and wondering when the visual feast will finally end.Between the cardboard caricatures, lame dialogue, telegraphed plot developments, and finally Sigourney Weaver failing miserably at convincing anyone she's a 13 year old girl who's parents just don't understand, you'll find anything but the visuals hard to remember. Even the characters names are quickly forgotten.And who could possibly believe that any government would not only sanction, but fund at enormous expense and loss of assets a personal vendetta with negligible ROI? If it was so critical to rid the planet of the, what are they called? The Rapa Nui's? (Whatever) - some strategic bombing would have easily done the trick.Just ugh."
"Wow, where do I even begin? This is an incredible movie that completely blew me away! As an amateur movie enthusiast, I must say that this film was a true masterpiece. Director James Cameron did not disappoint with his long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster hit, Avatar.First of all, the visual effects were absolutely stunning. The world of Pandora came to life in a way that I could not have even imagined. The colors, creatures, and landscapes were so vibrant and detailed, it felt like I was right there alongside the characters. The underwater scenes were especially breathtaking, with the way the light danced and reflected off the water creating a truly magical and otherworldly atmosphere.The storyline was just as captivating as the visuals. The characters were well-developed and had such depth and complexity that I found myself emotionally invested in their journey. The theme of environmentalism and the importance of preserving our planet was also beautifully woven into the story. It was a powerful reminder that we are all connected to nature and that our actions have consequences.The acting was superb, with standout performances from returning cast members like Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, and Sigourney Weaver. But the real scene-stealer was newcomer, Bailey Bass, who played the role of a Na'vi teenager named Kari. She brought such a sense of vulnerability and strength to her character that it was impossible not to root for her throughout the film.Overall, Avatar: The Way of Water was an amazing cinematic experience that I would highly recommend to anyone. It exceeded all of my expectations and left me feeling inspired and awestruck. James Cameron has truly outdone himself with this incredible film, and I can't wait to see what he has in store for us in the future."
"Usually in your second installment of a franchise series you don't spend 2/3rds of the 3hr+ runtime
doing exposition and world building. Mr Cameron knows this and has proven it's his strong point like in T2. I understand Pandora and the Na'vi are a lot more complex than robots becoming sentient and wanting to destroy humanity but if Cameron is planning more of these films then he could have spread it out a little more.Asking audiences to sit in a theater for this much world building after doing a nearly inordinate amount in the first installment is too much. I left the theater about 2hrs in because nothing of note actually happened in the movie. Caught a pirate stream to see what I missed - seems like all I missed was a mad-dash to an open-ended ending to set up part 3 and beyond.Performances were much better in this one. I was hoping to hear Jake Sully sound like an American all the way through and not dip into Worthington's Surrey accent, but I guess you can film an entire act underwater with motion capture but can't do another take of voiceover for consistency.The novelty of 3D in theaters has sadly worn off and the 3D filmwork in the movie was abysmal. The framerate kept noticeably dipping and speeding up during heavy 3D scenes. I was really looking forward to this sequel but it really underdelivered compared to the first one. Which I did watch before going to the theater and throughly enjoyed."
"I thought it is boring because I've seen the first movie which is top of my best. Story made it through for the whole family which timely relevant for this season of Christmas. 🙌 Hands down to James Cameron and the rest of the cast. I mean we can just seat and relax throught the whole story which makes me laugh, love and cry, it's like one package in a movie. The visual is also the best! They give justice to the 3D cinematic experience, one of the best story also.I would greatly recommend this movie to the whole family whatever age you may have, this is awesome! I preferred watching alone because I know I am super emotional 😆."
"For sure it's amazing technically and very pretty to look at. I think there's been enough reviews about that. We all agree.But about the story part:The whole story is pretty odd, just focusing on the rampage of a single guy (the villain I don't know his name) who apparently has unlimited funds and no order can just go on a rant on his personal revenge tour.First movie they tried to get unobtainium, now they want whale brain, pretty much the same.This as the main arc, paired with a lot of plot holes, like why would the evil guy know they left the mountains and why would he believe it and not just still attack the mountains and burn it down like he did with other villages?I think it would have been much more interesting to explore the colony building aspect of the humans on pandora and a bit of their background, what happens on earth, what are their motives to build a colony?And then during the movie the build like a coexistence and trade weapons and goods and then something happens with a new villain or whatever...In the end of the movie the whole story of pandora did not really advance, We are exactly at the point from the beginning, Navi live in tribes, human evil.Compare it with the recent Planet of the apes trilogy, each movie has a clear advancement of story, society and relationships. First they get smart and have to establish a community.Second they have internal power struggles about how to live with humans.Third they're united in war against humans.A story like this is absolute lacking in avatar, but we've got to see an hour long fight with the evil guys.I almost dozed off in the end, it's just too long with no story.Also I didn't really feel anything about who dies or not, I'm not even sure if it was the older or younger son because they are basically the same.They tried ti create this dramatic moment but I honestly couldn't have cared less, it didn't make me feel anything."
"I was fairly critical of the original ""Avatar"" but rated it generally high with an '8' just the same because of its visual appeal and stunning cinematography. The same can be said for 'The Way of Water', and on an even larger scale if that's possible as it's a full half hour longer than the original. Which is why I watched the film in roughly three, one hour segments, primarily due to time constraints, but as a practical matter, some of the scenes are overlong and kind of wear you out. The same concerns exist here regarding the character of Jake Sully, a human being given a synthetic Na'vi body in ""Avatar"", but somehow he's managed to have a family with a native Na'vi woman, and it boggles my mind how that works. Fortunately, the dialog throughout the picture is not as cliché filled as its predecessor, so that was a plus. But the biggest plus is the representation of the world of Pandora as Jake and his family move from the land of the forest people to that of the Metayinka sea people. The attack by the cloned soldiers led by Quaritch (Stephen Lang) results in a most impressive array of colorful CGI and special effects that will be hard to top going forward, save for the next picture in this franchise, of which there are three more planned to my knowledge. And really, how do you top what you find here? I bet director James Cameron will find a way."
"To be honest I was one of those who wasn't too bothered about any Avatar sequels, I really enjoyed the original when it first came out and maybe saw it again a couple of times over the yearsI then saw the trailers for this and watched the original again with my kids who weren't even born when it came out and got caught up in the hype when the first reviews came out so booked tickets for the family to go on the opening weekend.We were all completely blown away, this movie is incredible. The story is a nice progression from the first, we are quickly brought up to speed with what's been happening on Pandora and then we're off and even though some reviews complain about the running time it certainly didn't feel like 3+hrs long. I was completely engaged and enjoyed every moment.The visuals are truly amazing and really need to be seen on the big screen in premium 3D as James Cameron really does know how to use 3D properly rather than just as a gimmicky money maker. He doesn't rush things or jump around with a million different cuts so you really get to immerse yourself in this world that he has created and builds on what has already been introduced in the original. He really knows how to do a sequelGranted the story isn't breaking new ground but it's essentially about a family trying to survive a threat that will just keep coming after them but I don't think the intention was to give us a convoluted plot so it works wellThe world of Pandora is expanded upon in this film and we are introduced to another tribe who live by the sea, this then treats us to some spectacular visuals and allows the characters to grow. There is more emotion this time around and there's a lot more focus on family which I thought worked really well especially towards the climax.And talking of the climax I wouldn't be surprised if Cameron has seen all the big movies of the last decade and has been plotting how to upstage them all and in my opinion he has done that. The last hour or so is breathtaking, the action scenes are incredibly well done and just keep getting bigger and bigger and it doesn't feel like CGI overload either as Cameron lets you immerse yourself in this world before blowing your mind. Words simply don't do it any justice it really has to be seenThe visuals will undoubtedly get all the praise here but I felt the cast did an amazing job too and hope they get the credit they deserve as they make the Na'vi seem real. Stephen Lang especially is brilliant in his roleIt's great to have Cameron back as he is a special filmmaker operating on his own level and Avatar 3 can't come soon enough."
"13 years ago, ""Avatar"" stunned the world and became the highest-grossing film of all time (at the time of its release.) I remember seeing it in 3D back then, and while its story was sometimes conventional, it was a uniquely immersive theatrical experience that genuinely transported the viewer to another world. Given that so much time has passed since the first one, many people raised questions about whether the sequel could deliver not just in visual spectacle, but in telling a more unique and profound story than its predecessor. While James Cameron's technical dedication to his craft is undeniable, ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is ultimately a mixed bag.The film is set more than a decade after the first movie, and Jake and Neytiri have kids now. The villainous colonel from the first movie has now been reborn as a ""recombinant,"" and is planning to attack the Na'vi again. Meanwhile, Jake and Neytiri embark on a number of adventures through the oceanside and underwater regions of Pandora. As expected, the film is visually stunning, and the CGI of Pandora looks absolutely exquisite in a premium large format screen. The underwater CGI is incredibly realistic and lifelike, and every shot looks like it was developed by a VFX team working at the absolute highest level. The film's pacing is generally fine, developing the story and relishing in the immersive atmosphere of Pandora before building up to an action-packed final act. However, the film is just simply too long. While long running times can work well if justified by the density of the plot, the story here is largely a retread of the first movie, and its attempts at character development are largely pretty shallow. Here, it seems like an entire hour of the movie could have been cut. It's a bit unfortunate that after so much time, Cameron didn't end up doing much to further develop his characters or make them more engaging and interesting. That said, the unique blockbuster spectacle and technical craftsmanship makes this ""Avatar"" still a unique experience in Dolby or IMAX, although I can't say that I'm super excited for the third one. 6/10Note: I saw the film in Dolby Cinema 3D. The Dolby Vision projection (especially the light levels,) Dolby Atmos sound, and rumble were all utilized well. The 3D was generally good, although I found the high frame rate scenes looked quite jarring."
". . . is a plausible look at the future of potential or possible Earthling space travel clearly are barking up the wrong universe. AVATAR: THE WAY OF WATER makes absolutely no effort to explain how manned space flight could get beyond the boundary of Human's own solar system, and that would be the tiniest possible baby step compared to reaching ANY other solar system, let alone one with an Earth-like atmosphere, Earth-like bipeds dominating the other critters on their planet while behaving almost exactly as Earthlings in a wide variety of situations. Transporting more than half the resources and most of the scientists of our Sun's solar system to a far off galaxy also strains the credulity of the most ill-informed Real Life first-grader residing anywhere on our globe Today. WATER actually is a thinly-veiled anti-whaling tirade, meant to demean, embarrass and humiliate our S-h-a-m-u and Flipper munching friends in Japan and elsewhere in Asia. It does a very good job in picturing how such Evil miscreants should be disarmed."
"I've patiently waited for years for this movie to finally arrive. The world desperately needs the sense of mystery, hope, magic - which I presumed was what we were gonna get here, but I have to say - it was very dissapointing.We learn nothing new about Jake and Neytiri, and their characters need further development because their inner dynamics were one of the strong points in the original. Jake's narration and video logs in the first movie, his transformation and falling in love with Neytiri and Pandora were a strong point in the first movie.Actually, none of the characters have depth and development. The dialogues are horrible.There is no mystery, no real world building except - ""Hey, some Na'vis love water and there are some cool creatures there.""The story is really bad. Bringing back the old one-dimensional bad guy, whom nobody wants too see back.Humans want to live here? Why, what happened? What about unobtanium? Why Amrita?The only slightly magical part for me was that girl who has a special connection with Eiwa, that was interesting and I had hoped too see more. And learn more about Eiwa.In the end, nothing was resolved, after a long 3 hours.Like another reviewer here said, all style no substance. I could go on and on about the faults of this movie, but in the end I am glad it is doing well, because it might help achieve Cameron's goal about inspiring people to care about nature more."
"I can't get over the fact the sequel's main drive was people trying to stealthily save each other and failing miserably, causing a never-ending hostage situation
other than that unlike the first movie where the characters Tsu'tey and jake flirted with the idea of taking the cheap road to create conflict with cliches such as love triangles and miscommunication tropes but when push came to shove characters understood the imminency of war and put the troublesome fiancee subplot to rest.But in the sequel, it is the former. Lo'ak doesn't even attempt to explain the situation with the ostracized tulkun to Tonowari. He basically repeats ""you are wrong"" and expects cooperation. How is the audience supposed to root for the underdog if all he does is spat out vague statements against the status quo when explaining things and getting help is well within his reach. What is this Riverdale?And then we see that scene which is pretty familiar from all the other hollywood blockbusters where the character leaves in a huff to protect the fragile spark of a conflict from dying out. And fuels the fire by botching the rescue mission. Unfortunately, it doesn't end there like a mediocre movie would. It leans further into that trope by repeating the same thing over and over and over and over again. That's four if I am guessing right. I zoned out after that one cause it stopped being funny after the third. If they didn't take the whole final act of the movie it would have been fine and I wouldn't have criticized it for two paragraphs but as a casual moviegoer myself I can tell you that this ouroboros of rescue missions was irritating and not just ""action-packed"".Which is a great point to segue into the strongest parts of the movie. Graphics. The movie looks gorgeous with the whole aliens on the beach aesthetic. Cgi is awesome. Special effects are great. Underwater sequences in particular are of an unforgettable kind. The animals they designed for this fictitious planet really made it feel like it had a unique biosphere whenever they appeared. And it's great that they made their way into the plot with an environmentally conscious message even more than the first movie. This is a movie you really, truly need to see in 3d, unlike many other movies that added the feature just as a marketing strategy, avatar, as expected, delivers.Finally, Quaritch not dying after being choked to the point of passing out in the depth of the ocean and then being revived by an oxygen mask that came long after has nothing to do with the story itself but everything to do with franchising. It is disappointing to learn that the series will be open to compromising the quality of the story and originality in the name of making more movies. They will just be at the level of quality of James Cameron but still forced. And that's a 7/10."
"It's too bad everything went into the special effects and they forgot to write a story that makes any sense!Basically, Colonel Quaritch makes a Na'vi clone of himself to hunt Jack Sully. Jack now has 4 children and they run away to another place where there are sea people.Quaritch finds them, they fight. The whole thing lasts 3h12.So many things make no sense, like arrows that go through windshields, bullets that miss all the time, the indigenous people that fight with sticks and win, none of the characters produce any bubbles in the water...Talking about the sea tribe, they were there for the last fight and when the son dies, they completely disappear. Are you telling me they left the fight before it was over? WHY???Why is the mom following her daughter in the ship trying to get out of it by going further down?Why is Spider helping the bad guys all of a sudden?And how was he conceived, again?What I found disturbing is the hate humans have and their barbaric ways. So much hate. They come back to the planet to prepare for humanity displacement by destroying a lot of the territory right away on their arrival.It's a really colourful movie, but it's black and white in its core.I really loved the esthetic of this movie. This world is beautiful, but I didn't connect to any of the characters, unfortunately, because we don't get to really know them."
"Ok, yes, no doubt visually captivating. The underwater scenes are sublime. The 2nd hour is the most tedious time I've spent in a cinema though. Cameron says he wanted time to explore the characters more, given this wasn't done in the 1st, however, he jumps into doing this but it feels rushed. The film didn't need 3hrs+ to do all of this. We're just meant to accept that Jake's avatar has babies with an alien and that's that. It was overlong, boring and ultimately bland. Folks who aren't regular cinema goers will flock to this in droves and probably will enjoy it. It's a popcorn flick that attempts to bring emotion but in the end it is an emotionless, vast blue pit of nothingness. Oh, and don't get me started on the villain...."
"I really hope this is the last 'Avatar' film I ever see. They are not for me. They are designed for people who are under the influence and just want some fun visuals to look at. There's no substance, hell there's barely even a plot. And they still find a way to stretch it well past 3 hours.The best movie villains are relatable. You don't have to be on their side, but you have to understand where they are coming from. This movie doesn't have that. The villain's motives are as forced as I've ever seen in a film. And it's exactly the same as the first movie.The movie may look good, if you care about that, but I will never understand the concept of everyone looking exactly the same. It's exhausting having to look for small details in every single scene just to work out who is actually talking.This one is long, tedious, lacking in any kind of a story and immediately forgettable. They even found a way to make Jemaine Clement boring. I must've looked at my watch a hundred times during this movie and I swear at one point time had actually gone backwards. A very generous 3/10."
"Animated kids cartoon movie, no strong story, old and weak script serve with hight ticket rate to make public fool, seems we are watching NGC channal in animated form, extended long movies without any sense.if the film will earn money no suprise due to advertising and false scripted promotion. I wasted my INR1000 IN IMAX 3D, but you guys can be lucky to save your time and money. No much 3D effects, nothing is reality, all are graphics and computer work, nothing suprise in this movies, director tried incash the popularity of the 1st part. Not upto expectations. Feels like cheap quality Chinese movie watching in high rate."
"Saw this movie on opening night in 3D IMAX and I was left speechless. I can't remember seeing such beautiful visuals in any movie before. But not only the visuals, also the storylines and action scenes were just mindblowing. James Cameron once again showed us why he's the best director (IMO) of all time and now I also understand why he needed 13 years for the sequel. He wanted to make a perfect sequel and he sure did that. In my opinion it's up there with 2 other perfect sequels: Aliens and Terminator 2. I can't wait for part 3 and how it will follow up the storyline. Should pick up many Oscars."
"Avatar: The Way of Water: Finally got to see it and it;s not bad at all. OK: it's long but it doesn't drag, I admit though some long scenes of the youngsters, running through the forests, swimming, having fun etc could have been cut,maybe 30 minutes worth. But I liked these self indulgences by Cameron. It's 16 years after the first film, (Navi) Sully and Neytiri now have a family of hybrid Navi-Human children and also raise Colonel Quaritch's son Spider as their own. But the Corporation comes back. Burning forests, building Bridgehead City. The world is to be despoiled once more. Sully leads guerilla attacks.. Great battle scenes as a maglev train is derailed. Aerial battles. The Earthlings have an ace up their sleeve though, Quarritch is literally back from the dead with other marines, Recombinants-Na'vi avatars implanted with deceased human soldiers' memories, Eventually Sully and family have to flee to islands in the oceans, where a different type of Navi live, using what can best be described as giant flying garfish to fly around on, We encounter sentient whales and Rarth whalers as the revenant colonel pursues his vendetta against Sully. Wonderfully imagined fauna and flora which form a symbiosis with Navi and hybrid Navi. Enough action (despite the longeurs) to hold your interest. Directed, co-written and produced by James Cameron. 8/10."
After 12 years how disappointing. Should have just made it the year after the difference in effects wasn't worth the wait. Plot was bad and felt like he could have made the movie 2 hours. I loved the first movie and this felt like a tv version. Effects were wonderful and so was the underwater world but story was long and drawn out considering not much happened. Can't complain too much that some of it felt more like a nature documentary then a science fiction. I saw the original a few times in the theatres and I feel like it wasn't even worth going to the theatres but no shows worth seeing since 2019.
"What the first film does well is done even better in Avatar 2, but what the first film did badly is done even worse in this sequel. The first film was a groundbreaking, enthralling cinematic experience in terms of effects, and there is no doubt that this film is even bigger, more beautiful, more breathtaking than the previous film. To set your perspective, you can compare the special effects in recent marvel films with that of this film to see this film is leaps and bounds ahead. But alas, a collection of pretty pictures does not a story make. The story in the first film was thin but simple enough, allowing the audience to empathise and feel for Jack. Here, Jack tacks a backseat as we are introduced to many more characters, and as a result, the audience does not care for Jack as much. The writing is also painfully average, and the dialogue terribly trite. But avatar 2 distinguishes itself from other vapid blockbusters with its groundbreaking effects, despite its lacklustre screenplay riddled with inconsistencies."
"I really wanted to like it, and I will probably still be very excited to see the next one. It seemed to move very fast with the story and there was not much there to move you. Maybe it is more of a set up for the next movies to come. The visuals were conflicting. There were stunning scenes that were really fantastic, but there were also a handful of scenes that seemed really corny. It would remind me of 1990' Power Rangers. In a weird fast forward way. I do not like the scenes where they used a fast speed. It looked corny and cheap. The other 90% was fantastic though. I hope the next installments can capture more heart and feeling than this one."
"This is my first IMDB Review because I felt like I just had to warn people about this film.Was waiting to watch this film for many years now, to end up watching a cheap TV soap opera about their delinquent/disobedient Family.The first 2 hours and 15 minutes of the film are boring with no story, just about his delinquent/disobedient family and how he is a coward now and runs away from his so-called family in the forest (from the first movie) to join the sea people and bring the war to them anyway, and destroy their world instead.The film is full of potholes from the very beginning.So the humans basically come back to Pandora to colonise It is the main part of the story.Why would you colonise a planet that you cannot even breve on? I'm sure there's many other planets in the galaxy that would be better suited for the human race.Next it feels like this massive military/space operation is solely to capture Jake Sully and to go fishing for Whales, i'm sure that whaling on the Earth was banned many years ago.The last 45 minutes of the film is basically Titanic, and that's all you will have in your mind when you're watching it.I was quite surprised I didn't see Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet standing on the front of the boat saying I can fly Jack.Trust me, all you will think about is Titanic at this part especially when the boat sinks.And the biggest surprise and disappointment for me for James Cameron, film to have bad CGI moments.I strongly believe that because James Cameron's love of the ocean and submersibles, it's clearly something about his passion and not about what cinema audience want.I really don't understand some of the reviews of 10 and people saying it's the best film I've ever watched. For me It's got to be one of the worst films I've ever watched and would not even be in my top 100.Please do not waste your money and wait for it to come out on streaming for free, It's basically a cheap TV soap opera about a dysfunctional family.If you feel the urge to go and watch it at the cinema, turn up 2 hours and 15 minutes late, (unblock the toilet at home first or something) and you'll get a better film. Hmm better no I'll take that back. You get a mediocre film or a remake of the end of Titanic.Do not believe the people that leave this film 10 star review, I think they are paid to leave these reviews because it's definitely not a 10 star film, not even a 2."
"Even though I haven't watched the first one in years, I found this sequel so heart warming, tearful, visually appealing and entertaining! Many people are being ridiculous with hating on it, I wouldn't consider it ""bad"" at all, although it did take them 11 years to create a sequel, but what can you expect with the advanced cgi etc.. Did fumble about near the end but nether the less, still enjoyed it thoroughly. Loved the characters and the underwater scenes were just so magical and beautiful- I was amazed with how crystal clear the quality looked too, especially with the sunset scenes. I recommend others to watch it 100%!!"
"Seems that after spending money and time on special effects, animation, technology and character make-up and costumes, the studio ran out of money for script writers. After spending 3,5 hours in theatre, you are left with thinking ""What the hell was that chaos about""?The movie picks up where the first movie ended. The problem is that the movie never progresses past the initial introduction.This movie reminds of all the Bollywood ""masala"" movies of 70s and 80s. Characters avenging their the death of their loved ones, the ""sweet and gentle at heart"" characters, clansman ship, animals remembering their past and helping the characters at time of peril (""Haathi Mere Saathi"", ""Maa"" or ""Teri Meherbaaniyaan""). All the sub-plots in this movie have been done to death by Bollywood.Yes. We understand the allegory here - about European invasion of America. But that allegory is fun to watch when it is subtle - not drilled on the viewers' forehead by the director. Yes - we can see that James Cameron suffers from ""white guilt"", but he does not need to spend 3.5 hours to show that.I hope the next Mr. Cameron tries to focus more on script and less on the technology on Avatar 3."
"Storytelling is very poor and almost the same, as in the first movie. The movie seems like written by an AI. More fighting scenes than lore.Also translations are very bad because ""bro"", ""dad"" and ""buddy"" are no authentic words, for a spiritual species living on an other planet.It just sounds like out of an Teenage-Highschool-Movie instead of a film made for its actual target group (mid. 20s, that watched Part 1 - 13 years ago).I didn't like the movie at all and I am very disappointed by what modern movies seem to become... cashcows with 1h showdowns, that are so boring and repetitive, you start falling asleep."
"I am one who, like many people, found the first Avatar movie to be a wild visual experience. It was something that hadn't really been done before in the world of CGI and it certainly made a deep impression in my mind as film that I could return to when I was looking for a thrill.That said, the story in the original Avatar film was okay. It was a story that had been told before by Pocahontas, Dances with Wolves and maybe even The Last Samurai. An outsider, originally with devious intentions, assimilates to a community and realizes their intentions were misguided and becomes a champion of their newly loved community. A good story line to be sure, but it's been said before.Avatar: The Way of Water is essentially everything you liked and didn't like about Avatar (2009) on steroids. The visual effects are top tier, I've never seen anything like it (granted I ate an edible and we sat in the second row of a 3d showing). It was a blast. BUT the plot was even weaker than it's predecessor. They literally revive the bad guy general as an Avatar and he just chases Jake Sully's family around for 3 hours. It felt like watching a whole season of television in that there were 30 minute sequences that could have been done away with entirely (3 more of these are coming down the pipe???).Anywho, it's fun in the same way a Marvel movie is fun. A crazy visceral experience that has you a bit bewildered at the end as to why we recycled the story of the first film but in a Waterworld setting..."
"Going into this I figured it wouldn't be wise to underestimate James Cameron. He's directed two of the greatest sequels of all time with Aliens and Terminator 2. I was wondering, could he pull it off again?The answer is no. Like many of the other reviewers will tell you, the strongest point of the movie is the visuals. The story is the same as the first movie with many of the same events happening again and even some of the same dialogue being used again.Basically it's an inferior version of the first movie. It had some good ideas but didn't execute them as well as it could have. Being so similar to the first movie there really needed to be some other side plot or something going on, especially when the movie is three hours long.Since seeing the movie it really made me think about Terminator 2. Terminator 2 is very similar to The Terminator but it's bigger and better in almost every way. Avatar 2 needed to be bigger and better than Avatar and it's not.The 3d was pretty cool. There were moments when it was like you were right there with the characters on screen."
"First off, this movie is visually stunning. The scenery, the machinery, the animals, are all in large part CGI but it's very well done. This part of the movie is on par with the first Avatar. The CGI of the the returning principal characters was a bit off for some reason, especially in scenes with the family group. They often did not look like their former selves. The biggest disappointment was the story itself. To me, it was the same storyline as the first movie except that it occurred in water instead of the forest. Also, the ending was just a setup for Avatar 3. For that much time and money they should have done much better."
"If you watched the first one then you will know what to expect, much the same. Thy film went on way too long and I had to take a break in the middle and do something else for a while. This movie was over hyped as many are these days in an attempt and actually provided little more than the original.If you watched the first one then you will know what to expect, much the same. Thy film went on way too long and I had to take a break in the middle and do something else for a while. This movie was over hyped as many are these days in an attempt and actually provided little more than the original."
"Visually the CGI is amazing but if it wasn't for the last hour of the film being slightly more entertaining than the rest of this bore fest I would have much preferred to be at home watching the news. This film fails to get going til the end by which time I'd lost the will to live. Surprisingly it lack's imagination IMO. It's almost as if JC has thought let's make an alien dolphin and whale and that'll do. There are elements of planet of the apes, titanic, terminator and alien in here but it's all just style over substance. I didn't buy in to any of the characters, in fact I didn't like any of them! Couldn't name anyone apart from Jake Sully and was just hoping Pandora would blow up so I could go home. I feel like it took me as long to watch this film as it took to make it, hopefully it's another 13 years before the next. 4 stars for the CGI only."
"Visuals are top notch, action is ok but too little for its runtime. Talking about the runtime: it is way too long for what the movie has to tell. And where I thought the story would go deeper (eg into the mystics of Pandora/Eywa) it left this path too quickly. I was a little bit disappointed in total. I'm sure some writers could build a lore engaging storyline with less than 1% of the production budget.I got a ""Force awakens"" feeling: you know, droid carries a secret, young here rises up, seemingly unbeatable enemy with super weapon. Translate that to Pandora: guys master animals / fish, superbaddy goes after hero and lives to fight another day, mighty battle with role for the creatures ...
Hopefully better next time..."
"You can every scene was written because someone said ""hey this would look cool. Now write 45 mins about it.""
They created this weak, overtold family garbage and were constantly throwing in the cheapest tricks to make you feel bad for the characters instead of making them interesting in any way. The youngest son never learns just so they can push the story forward and try and create conflict.There was a whole side story about the daughter being supposedly special but they gave it no time to work out anything or give any answers so they can instead fit an entire hour of just staring silently at nice CGI.If you want to turn off your brain for an entire three hours, it's nice to look at but don't expect any real story."
"First of all never doubt James Cameron.Avatar: The Way of Water is Came out on 16th of December 2022,this is a beautifully stunning, bigger, better & more emotional than the first one.In this new three-hour movie, James Cameron can turn any viewer into a big fan of his own franchise, who are eagerly waiting for the next movies. The movie ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is considered as a new beginning for this franchise and Cameron was able to further develop the script and characters and remove the weakness of the first movie. He has also created one of the most extraordinary cinematic experiences.Plot-wise, Avatar 2 is just a remake of its sibling. But add 10 years effort of one of the most talented directors, boom, we are pulled into a magic world.Watch it in IMAX 3D, even if it means you must take half a day leave from your work. It provides out of the world experience, literally.Some people forget that movies have to be entertaining too and not just crazy plots. Avatar 2 is entertaining the whole way through and I really recommend seeing this at the movies especially in 3D. I will watch every Avatar James Cameron makes.As James Cameron prepared his sequels to his mega-success Avatar, one of the more intriguing aspects of the production was that Stephen Lang, who played the first film's villain, Colonel Miles Quaritch, would be returning for Avatar: The Way of Water and the rest of the franchise.Review by: Anil Chouhan."
"Mediocre overall. They spent 250 million on VFX and it paid off. Most scenes look stunning, especially those with Na'vi people. Other scenes look simply good, comparable to PS5 graphics. The 3D effects were cool too.The major flaw for me, was the plot. Nothing interesting happens, the story is very predictable thus boring. Also, the dialogues are pretty lame, for example avatars calling at each other: ""hey bro"". Acting was good but not great. They could have easily made this movie shorter, cutting down some scenes that didnt serve the plot or the ones that felt like a documentary for the environment.James Cameron didn't deliver in this one. VFX guys saved the day! I would not recommend watching this film unless you enjoy video effects so much."
"The movie is beautiful. The filming resulted in a lot of eye-candy, one more beuatiful gem after another. The underwater scenes are magnificent. I will see this movie at least twice more. Just because of the visual mastery.I would declare myself a fool during my third viewing, because the story is barren, simple, it will not win any literary prizes. The story leads me to a lot of ""Why?"" questions. Why would anybody takes this decision, say such things, act such a way?Why would humans go back to this planet? They first came for the element Unobtainium, and that stuff is not mentioned once in this movie.Why did humanity come back in full force? To portray humanity as evil aliens, as so many aliens brutally attacked Earth in other SF movies? Like there is there no ethical oversight on Earth, to control evil schemes like this. Like there are no other planets in the Galaxy that would be a good host for humanity, so now they are going to eradicate the Na'vi.Quaritch is like evil Putin and out on a murder spree invading other people's territory, and Jake Sully is like Ukraine's Zelensky defending his country, except that Jake Sully does leave the forest, even though it is not clear why. He leaves because Quaritch is only after him. That is weird, because elsewhere, humans are destroying the planet, the habitat of the Na'vi.Why would Sully flee to another Na'vi tribe, and endanger them? Why are these Sea Na'vi so inhospitable? Why is there such adversity between different tribes of the same species, on a planet that breathes love and cooperation between species.I guess evolution would have changed the shape of the bodies of the Na'vi, so that forest Na'vi have different tails and arms from the sea Na'vi, but I am pondering how long evolution would have taken to make changes as extensive as these.Why would Sully call for medical support when his daughter is unconscious, and why would that medical support come in human airflight? Anybody with half a brain would know that the flight path would be tracked by satellites, and lead to the Sea Na'vi.Why is the treatment of Sully's daughter by the witch doctor of the Sea Na'vi so akin to human pseudo-science (mock-acupuncture and laying on hands)? I would have expected some potions, maybe a mind-meld, or some other supernatural stuff, but not this.Why has the sea creature, the tulkun Payakan, a neural connector in his mouth? What would the evolutionary benefit be? It's the first species we meet on Pandora we see that has the neural connector on such an inconvenient spot.How did the humans find out about the Amrita of the tulkun? With dozens of new species introduced in this movie, how did they find out that such a giant being has a small amount of liquid that makes humans immortal? Planet Earth still has millions of undiscovered species, and every year we find a being that has some protein or other molecule that can be used as medicine. Such molecules are being synthesised when they are useful, so that Amrita does not need to be harvested from superintelligent beings like the tulkun. I guess humanity in the future is even more unethical as current humanity, even though we nowadays frown on whaling. This whole thing has ruined the movie's story for me, because a large part of the whole movie depended on humanity setting up a large-scale tulkun-hunting infrastructure, within a year of arrival on the planet.Another holy tree. How many of such trees are there on Pandora? Will we encounter mountain Na'vi, river Na'vi, underground Na'vi and other tribes who each have a holy tree? Each just one of them, because who cares about backup systems. Why didn't the humans go around searching for such mighty trees and destroy them all to easier subjugate all the Na'vi.Colonel Quaritch returning as an evil Na'vi avatar is just as unbelievable as him having a son, and as Grace Augustine still being alive but unconscious AND her having a daughter.Why are the human vehicles so sloppy that a Na'vi arrow can penetrate a wind shield and kill the pilot.Why didn't the Na'vi prepare for a return of evil humans? As if the humans would be ever defeated, or taking a loss."
"I had some decent hope for this film, but overall it's simply boring, it might be suitable for very little children, just for the spectacle. I thought they would take some of the best aspects of the original and improve upon it, but this feels hollow, unfun, pretty much nothing like the OG.I went with a S/O and we both disliked it so much we left with about 40 minutes left (only 3 films I've done that). That is coming from someone who watch the original Avatar 3 times in theater. This was with alcohol involved thinking it was going to be just a great time, a blast even. It's a shame really, probably too much politics involved that impeded this product, preventing it from being truly great.Save money and watch this when it is free on a streaming platform."
"Avatar worked because of how simple and to the point it was, amazing visuals, relatable story, great soundtrack working all together to deliver an impressive blockbuster.Avatar Way of water is basically a downgrade in all aspects apart from visuals.Soundtrack is worse, stakes are lower, characters are boring. Movie is filled with pointless scenes to the point it makes u question if you're not watching nature documentary. They worked on the scripts for soooo long and this is the best they could come up with?Perfect mix of elements that made first movie work are not present here, it's very mediocre and could have been so much more."
"Looks great!But its story lacks greatly comapred to the first movie.I've probably watched the first movie over 50 times,
and it breaks me into tears every time, and I truly feel invested in the world and its characters...Avatar 2 thought?Not really, the characters are flat, the story arc is odd and quite poor. I could not cear less about the whales, and I don't think they should have played such a big part as they did.The movie also felt very rushed, there is so much world building, but I never once felt deeply imersed in the world,
no way close as to the first moive.The entire movie felt like an empty shell of a filler for the next movie. Wich i'm not gonna wait for as much as did for this one,
big dissapointment.A movie is not driven by its visuals, but its story...
I hope they care more about writing a stroy in the future
and not just making a three hour visual display."
"If you have the patience to watch a movie for 3.5hrs then you might like this movie. I felt the movie should have been 2-2.5 hrs not 3.5hrs long.so if you have courage to watch a movie for this long then it is for you.the visuals were good.other than that there is nothing positive about this movie . Weak story line , predictable, better watch it at home. Instead of spend money and time on this movie . So please watch this movie if you have a lot of time and energy to watch such a long movie. Then you watch but prepare yourself for a long ride and very dry movie felt like a documentary at times."
"Here are my reasons (in no particular order).First off, at the end of the movie when the Sully family is fighting for their lives (against Colonel Miles Quaritch and his army guys, then with the threat of drowning) what were the Metkayina people doing? I mean they were there ready for a fight to rescue the chief's daughter (Tsireya) and the other children then suddenly disappeared...Neytiri just witnessed the death of her son (Neteyam). You would think she'd grab on to her children for dear life, but can't hold the hand of her daughter (Tuktirey) as she gets sucked by water in the ship.When Spider got caught, thank god Quaritch saved him and not tortured for the rest of the movie because no one really seemed to care to go save him.How did Quaritch know Sully's son Neteyam was dead? The army goons shot at him, but he jumped in the water and fled with his family. There's no way they saw Neteyam bleeding or they would've shot at him again. Even if we assume they did see blood, how could they have known it was fatal?There were too many storylines surrounding the main action (which I consider being the fight between Jake Sully and Colonel Miles Quaritch). Like the relationship between Lo'ak and Tsireya then Lo'ak with Payakan (the whale) or Kiri having a seizure and almost dying.Now enough with the criticism and on with the solutions. Avatar 2 is already out, but what can be done with Avatar 3?I'd begin with Spider and how feelings of betrayal and anger begin to form towards Neytiri as she threatened to stab him in the second movie.Neytiri (unstable as she grieves the loss of her son) and Spider get in a heated argument over what happened which culminates with Neytiri telling Spider that he isn't a Na'vi and that even if he acts like one of them, he'll never be a real part of her species or her family. The other Sully children, who were eavesdropping interject but it's too late, Spider leaves the camp enraged.Meanwhile, General Frances Ardmore strongly reprimands Quaritch and strips him of his rank for his waste of resources (men, ships, the team who had the experience and knowledge of capturing the whales to get the serum) while failing to achieve his objective of killing Jake Sully.Spider finds his ''father'' Quaritch and together (with Spider's knowledge of Pandora and Quaritch's military acumen) find a tribe they can manipulate or coerce to fight with them against Sully. Following the fight between the clans, Spider gets a chance to kill Jake Sully but will kill his father at the same time if he acts. Spider kills both of them and becomes the villain against the Sully family in the next movie."
"The movie was a huge disappointment, like many movies lately it was way too long about 3 hours, and the story itself was boring, really boring. There are mayor holes in the plot and overall sense of the movie.SPOILER ALERT!Like I'm one of the later scenes, where spider (human child) decided to help out the main bad guy (his father) and helped him to shore, he thanked him and asked him to join, he declined. And SOMEHOW the main characters standing about 200f away did not see him fly off. Additionaly, when they ware going out of the water it was night, but a second later it was day.Don't get me wrong, the movie was buetifull, but just like with people, looks ain't everything."
"Where can I begin with this film I have patiently waiting years to see, well Jake Sully lives with his newfound family formed on the extrasolar moon Pandora. Once a familiar threat returns to finish what was previously started, Jake must work with Neytiri and the army of the Na'vi race to protect their home. The visuals are out of this world, the story? Compelling, the cast? Back better than ever, I thoroughly enjoyed this sequel to avatar, I cannot wait to catch the third.James Cameron has a way when it comes to writing a compelling story and adding some even more incredible visuals, this is by far the best movie I've seen this year, alot to come that could top it but I don't think so, great filmHighly Recommend!"
"Same as the first movie, just water version. I've seen one movie in my life that was longer (7 years in Tibet), and that movie was good. This movie on the other hand, I was ready to leave 30 minutes in. The cultural appropriation is appalling in my opinion.The plot was very predictable. The action was cheesy at best. I'm very surprised this is even a James Cameron flick. Just a total let down from beginning to end. Has CGI run its course yet ? I would have been pleasantly surprised by some real sets and soundstage work. I'm sure this movie cost millions to make but it's not worth the price of your ticket. Waste of time."
"Go and catch this in near by theatre with your family,Guys hats off to everyone of part of avatar the way of water ,,guys for 3 hours I was like part of this movie I lost in this movie , I live this movie , hope we will see next part soon , can't wait for long.Guys please try to watch 3D because you can feel this movie if u r watching in 3D.Guys hats off to everyone of part of avatar the way of water ,,guys for 3 hours I was like part of this movie I lost in this movie , I live this movie , hope we will see next part soon , can't wait for long.Guys please try to watch 3D because you can feel this movie if u r watching in 3D."
"""Avatar: The Way of Water"" was an incredibly immersive and visually stunning film experience. The Pandora landscape and its inhabitants were so realistic and well-crafted that I felt like I was actually on the planet. The special effects were truly groundbreaking and left me in awe. The bioluminescent plants and creatures were especially mesmerizing, adding to the overall beauty and realism of the film.The story was engaging and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the film. The plot twists and turns were well-executed and kept the story unpredictable. The themes of the film such as colonization, environmentalism, and the ethics of exploiting natural resources were thought-provoking and relevant to current issues.Sam Worthington's portrayal of Jake Sully was particularly noteworthy. He brought a lot of depth and emotion to the character and made me truly care about his journey. The rest of the cast also gave strong performances, adding to the overall impact of the film.Overall, ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" was an exceptional film that left a lasting impression on me. The visuals were breathtaking, the story was engaging and thought-provoking, and the performances were strong. It's a must-see for fans of the first film and for anyone who appreciates groundbreaking filmmaking. I would highly recommend it."
"...after hitting writer's icerberg of incompetence, the visuals fail to remove a foul aftertaste that follows through a questionable plot advancement and cheesy lines of script. It's missing a heart - something its predecessor carried throughout the story, and kept us viewers engaged. Like fast food, Avatar 2 delivers a quick dopamine rush to the brain, but nothing to nourish our brains long-term.Still a believer in James Cameron and his Avatar franchise, I hope other movie goers join in asking director to prioritize substance over abundance when it comes to quality writing, and polish the future scripts, like he polished his Pandora."
"I knew years ago how the next Avatar were going to be and it was just as expected. I was not surprised at all about how bad it was and what it was going to be about.I got tormented for 3 hours because my girlfriend wanted to se it day one. Funny though half way through out the movie she said ""what is this crap, I want to go home"" and I answered with ""I told you so""All the hype and all those high ratings by people and critics shows the difference between someone who really knows about cinema and who have been watching movies their whole life like me here, and others who easily affected by visuals and main stream. Which is also applies to video games these days.I won't go into details really because I would have to write for hours about so many things that were faulty and incredibly bad.So many actors were bad and what even worst so many characters was unbelievably pure crap and did not make any sense at all. The story is by far one of the most boring and common stories you can get from a children's Disney movie. The dialogue, lines and script is so bad I was really tortured.If you actually compare the visuals with the first one then they're on par which makes the visuals actually outdated. If you look closely every little CGI was noticeable and average at best by today's standards for being a movie.If you someone who watched thousand of movies and also play a lot of high end games. You would se that Avatar CGI nothing special now days nothing special at all.When the movie ended no one clapped and no one was happy. The disappointment on every bodies face was so clear and I would hear here and there people bashing the hell out of the movie.Movie a solid 5/10 at best and the popcorn was also 5/10 because of too much salt."
"I give the technical achievement: an A+
Ambition: A- (it did not disappoint)
the sound design and music: B
Acting: B-
Production Design: A
Character development D-
Costumes: B+I liked the first Avatar much better, but I give ""The Way of the Water"" a solid B-I think part 3 will be better, as Cameron is probably holding out the best stuff.Some final thoughts:Jake Sully is just a terrible protagonist. And the bad guy (Colonel Quartich) is not interesting at all. He is WAY too cliché and there's no inner conflict. The best bad guys are people who you can relate to. And people who are good in a lot of ways. When this film started, the bad guys just jumped into the avatars and we're on the hunt. Very disappointing.The Sully family montage in the beginning was rushed, but interesting... but it was ultimately flat. The entire family is just flat. Charming, yes and cute... but flat. None of the characters really stick with you when you leave the theater. And that's a problem.To be honest, I was disappointed with the movie until the whale destroyed the ship. That was so bad ass 😳🔥 and then it was just solid action for the next hour and it was really tricky how they pulled that off. A lot of intense pacing with holding breath underwater fight scenes. Well done 👏I didn't like the constant bullet dodging...it was pathetically too Hollywood in that way... and the underwater stuff in general wasn't quite as groundbreaking as I thought it was going to be... although the crab destroyer machines were awesome.I thought they didn't go far enough with the differences between the water people and the tree people. Because you know, the N'avi picked up on their swimming and their ways pretty fast - and I just don't think that Sully's kid would've been able to talk to that whale so quickly. I would've bought that relationship more if it was one of the water people, but what are you gonna do... the Sully kid death scene was a little weak and the Spider character (who has a mask that never comes off or never gets moved around on his head even a little bit and never runs out of oxygen) him saving his dad at the end was touching, but it would have been better if he went with him. That was a big opportunity lost. It was a little confusing that he saved him and then just bailed (setting up the same flat bad guy for part 3). 🙄Anyhow, there's not a better movie out right now. Just disappointed. I expected more from the most anticipated sequel of all time. I think Cameron has been living in James Cameron world a little too long and everyone is afraid to suggest better stories to him."
"Those 5 stars are for the environment designer team. For the story line: 0 star. I don't get why building a spiritual, matriarchal, indeginous planet but after all, the values of this movie evolve around conservative nuclear family, alpha-males (""the father must protect"" line) and that character constantly making stupid decisions. And not to mention how James Cameron create women characters out of his male-gaze-mind: the mothers are always unreasonable angry (why the father are calm and logical, reality hits different James), the teenage daughter is literally manic pixie dream girl lol, it's almost 2023 and James still build a 1990s trope, i wouldn't be surprise if there will be a pick me one in part 3. The only thing worth watching was the Pandora nature and animals."
"Overall, a beautiful film visually, but the story and the dialogue were laughable at times...i mean really laughable. Like, I laughed out loud numerous times during the film at some of the dialogue. These lines weren't meant to be comical, but were so bad that you had to laugh. I almost walked out 2 times earlier in the film and finally did at the end of the battle sequence. Cameron is an incredible film maker but needs some help with the story/writing. I'm hopeful that the sequels will address these issues. The first two acts in my opinion were really slow and dragged. I do however appreciate his take on how colonization destroys animal life and how we should be taking better care of the planet and it's inhabitants..but..still, this movie could have easily been 2 hours instead of the 3:15 that it runs..."
"I was a big fan of the original Avatar. I remember watching it at the cinema upon its release and loving it. I got the DVD and watched it many times too. When the internet sort of turned on Avatar and it became trendy to crap all over it, I was still in the camp that supported it and was always looking forward to the sequel.When the official trailer dropped after 100s of fake fan made trailers, naturally I was excited. I went to my local cinema on the first day it was available and was ready for another epic movie. However I left feeling as though I had seen one of the worst sequels ever made.Its clear that James Cameron was so focused on the cinematography and special effects that he neglected the writing. The plot of this movie was probably thought up in half a day or less. The action of this film is just generic and boring to watch. In many of the fight scenes at the end of the movie, its not even clear who is fighting who since all the avatars look exactly the same.I will admit the first hour was enjoyably and I did actually like it. But it feels like Jake does a complete 180 after this and just abandons his tribe and runs away to the ocean leaving his people to just fend for themselves against the humans I guess.I thought that the Colonel was a good villain in the first movie but I didn't need to see him again here and for the next movies. It also makes any death in avatar now feel pointless since they can just bring them back in a new avatar body. What made him a good villain in the first place was that despite being in a deadly world, he was still a threat without the need of an avatar body. Also what about the unobtainium? It never gets mentioned once in this movie despite that being the main reason for the humans being on Pandora in the first place. I get that they are trying to colonize the planet now, but nobody is interested in unobtainium now?Avatar 2 is just a long boring movie that has no plot and distracts you with the special effects. The characters are just bland and forgettable and I have no desire to see where they go in the next sequels.1 star out of 10."
13 years and in the end all we got was a national geographic lesson?Poorly told story. The writers seemed to have forgotten the plot behind the reincarnation of the already vanquished general. The explanation of their existence to defeat Jake Sully makes no sense.195 minutes of boredom. The animals carried this movie more than the characters. Why did the generals son suddenly start showing the general the way of the avatar. Why would they go through all that trouble to become avatars if you were not going to use it to your advantage.So many unanswered questions for the 3rd part? No thank u.
"Avatar: The Way of Water is the movie equivalent to the most extravagant junk food binge you can imagine. Its stunning visuals are a delicious feast for the eyes and the technical achievements on display carry the legacy of the original exactly how one would hope. But there is an emptiness here not unlike the feeling one has after gorging themselves like the Rock on cheat day. The feast may have been delicious but there was no nutritional value to be had.Here's a quick and dirty breakdown:PROS
+ Visuals are absolutely astonishing and may be worth the price of theatre admission alone for most
+ The world building on display is magnificent and it's tons of fun seeing another ecosphere on full displayCONS
Run time is excruciatingly longCharacter development is nearly non-existent and just about every single character feels flat and 2-dimensional.Instead of a sweeping, grandiose conflict the plot is driven by a family drama and revenge arc. Combined with the 2-dimensionality of most (if not all) the characters this makes for a much less captivating story than the first Avatar. At least in the first film the grand scale of the conflict somewhat hid the deficiencies in the charactersThe dialogue is atrocious. There will be drinking games in the future for every utterance of ""bro""Certain scenes are blatantly exploitative and ooze the kind of virtue signalling ignorance that has gotten James Cameron into trouble over the Avatar releasesJust like those pizza and pop nights capped off with a full pint of ice cream, Avatar: the Way of Water wouldn't be worth it if it didn't taste/look so good. Underneath that incredible veneer lies a subpar movie, even for mainstream Hollywood's modern standards."
"We humans are terrible. We colonize indigenous beings, exploit the land, have zero respect for existing cultures, and even hunt whales for sport. We're absolutely awful. Thank you James Cameron for bringing this to my attention and hammering it into my skull for three hours. I needed to know this over and over since I guess I didn't get that message from your previous Avatar film. Since we're bound to have several more of these with the exact same message about how terrible we are, I imagine this re-occurring theme is ahead of us for years to come.I'd really like to enjoy movies again.On the brighter side, the special effects are amazing, and the futuristic hardware is interesting."
"James Cameron really knew how to create a world and do it out of passion and love. It feels like a well developed story with Jake's family growing. Hard to believe we started with a paralyzed Marine and now he's a Navi with a family and connects to the World of Pandora. I feel proud to see him in this stage. I seriously can't wait for the rest of the movies to be released. It will, too, be well worth the wait. It almost reminds me of what it's like to read a book and how it was so good, the second book is released with others in waiting. I felt like I was reading an amazing series and I'm only on book 2. I cannot wait to see more of the characters again. The last time I was this excited watching a movie was Endgame. I didn't think I'd feel this way again. I watched it in 3D as well. It's a great movie to put into Sci-fi category. James Cameron's film did not disappoint. I thought it was perfect. The fight scenes had me on the edge of my seat. The calm moments gave me breath of relief, while knowing the anticipation will soon arrive. It gave room for the kids' character development as they adjust to their new home. I really can't wait to see more of the kids. That's something I'd never thought I'd say when I first saw the trailer and realized we may not be with Jake's story anymore. I love this movie and I can't wait to see this on repeat, and the rest of the series to come. Great job, James Cameron."
"Average story, stretched out way too long. Especially the first half. Animation in the first half is bad and feels like a computer game from the 00s. But it gets better as well in the second half.The 3D particle effects are as stunning as they were in the first movie and add a nice atmosphere. The 3D for obstacles worked very good as well.I have seen movies with better story. I have seen movies with more carefully crafted special effects and better animations.I asked myself if the first Avatar movie also had this poor animations or if the bar sits higher nowadays and they just kept the level of the first Avatar movie for this one. Definitely often doesn't feel like state of the art."
"There is no doubt that Mr. Cameron is indeed a Masterclass Filmmaker, his signature audacity to dream bigger than any one else is only rivaled by the amazement on the viewers face drenched in the Pandora visuals.I was truly mesmerized by the world he had created and Pandora is truly majestic in every frame he has produced.But unfortunately the story is weak and even though the characters is so compelling we never connect with them completely due to to the slow paced and sometimes borderline boring story telling.If I were to rate this fil just for the visuals it would have been a 10/10 for me."
"The colonial ambition of humans is a chronic desire witnessed over hundred of years and is not stopping any sooner, as Avatar 2, the way of water, directed by James Cameron has depicted, tremendously done in the first part of its sequel as well.James Cameron is facing really harsh criticism from indigenous activists, who think the film is actually a white savior narrative, a franchise that isn't subtle in its anti-colonial, anti-imperialist, and environmentalist themes- Cameron has said as much, previously referring to the first film as ""a science fiction retelling of the history of North and South America in the early colonial period.From the pronounced noses of the Southern Cheyenne Tribe or other physical characteristics like stereotypical angular cheekbones and long hair in braids, the Navi's are shown as mystical and noble solemn savages to an extent where it offended Maori people when the film reduces ta moko, a type of tattoo that is culturally significant and readable for Maori people, to abstract, meaningless shapes that reflects only the aesthetic values on the character's faces or bodies. The criticism has thrown James Cameron's effort to merely ""pretendians"", non-native people who when subjected to these traits and with generic native clothing or accessories appear Indigenous.The racist exploration of native people being reflected in the Avatar franchise may have offended indigenous people or Maroi to be particular who remained the center of the sequel but showing the film through the eyes of an alien, Jake Sully who inhabits a new body that mimics the native Navi, the tall blue humanoid species of Pandora, might have been ignorant of the fact that it actually is romanticizing the colonization that is much evident in the first part when the protagonist is sent initially for an imperialist mission.But let's talk purely on story merits. Although there is a deeper plot in the sequel introducing metkayina people of the reef, led by Ronal (Kate Winslet) and Tanowari (Cff Curtis), it lacks the story. Starting with the basic desire and message of the story that while protecting your family, you may lose everything viz, your place, your language, your people, your clan, and even your title, we lose the message on the way.In the first film, the white savior Jake Sully who sided with Navi after falling in love with the native Naytri defended Pandora from the human invaders who wanted their natural resources. They succeeded in defeating the invaders.In the sequel, Jake and Neytiri are living happily with their children and their stepdaughter Kiri and semi-feral human kid Spider when the ""sky people"" of the world reappear and want Jake Sully to be killed if they have any chance of looting and plundering Pandora.Jake Sully takes his family to the far end Metkayina people and soon have to learn the art of surviving deep under the water. The Sully's children and Tanowari Children were spiky and rivalrous in the beginning but then they find a way to be calm after Sully's elder son bonds with the whale-like creature Tulkun, who is abandoned by Metkayina people consider him a destroyer whereas it isn't. He was hit by Captain Mick Scoresby, who is hunting these species.So the film has nothing to do with humane emotions, twists, or surprises and nothing to carry on with the message. There is literally any character arc to be fulfilled or to overcome a misbelief. This misbelief inspires questions that make the story run.The high-tech film is full of CGI characters that mesmerize but they never link with your heart, so we start to care less about them.This flat story comes to the last scene eventually when there is a final fight between the Qatrich army and Metkayina clan along with Sully's family. It is when the underworld whale creature resonates back with fury and destroys the enemy ship and its weapons.Aside from the high-tech art superstructure what is there? Nothing. Yes, you can enjoy the three-hour-long film, if you are more of a video game lover knocking your opponent in a mystic world of unparallel creatures."
"The reviews here are an excellent depiction of how people have lost their long slightedness and are looking for a quick fix to their entertainment needs. To say that the movie is slow.. The purpose of a film is not to always tell you a complete-quick story, it's to entertain you. The visuals of the film are a delight in themselves, I would have loved to see some more of that. Also, I can clearly see the movie developing into a trilogy or a quadogy (if that's a word). So, the movie takes time to familiarize you with the characters of the water and also touches upon the different powers the children of Jake Sully and the water tribes possess and even the animals.I can obviously see it developing into an all out war and each Avatar is basically moving from battle to battle before that happens. If you don't have the patience to frikkin sit through the beautiful developments of various characters and storylines, then you have failed as an audience."
"More than 2 hour long screensaver in the style of late 90's PC's ,but with the better graphics, with guided meditation videos included , sometimes as well interrupted by bad dad jokes and obvious as hell protagonist-villain story. If you mute it you can put on any sound over it and it will be still the same boring screensaver.But when you decide to watch it with original sound every sentence that is at some point said for some reason sounds like an inspirational quote that you print on a wooden plaquette and hang in the kitchen in your grandma house next to ""eat, pray, love"" signs.What is more the reason I still have 3 stars are the fighting sequences. Although it felt like a studio figured out in the middle of making a movie, cool way to make underwater videos and they could not get enough of it. And I kind of wanna go swimming now so I feel brainwashed a bit.P. S. Blue people are less fake than a fact that they will put so much effort in any government just for a sake of eliminating one guy. C'mon he was not bothering anyone. But the costs of the mission ""we hate the guy "" were propably astronomical. I could imagine they spent billions on getting the copycat blue guys alone to the planet, the tools, everything. Bad blue guys are on payroll propably as well. So uncesseray. I bet that the Earth from this movie has bad roads and bad schools because all the taxes went to it."
Right from the start it's clear that you're watching an environmental film about the destruction of earth played out in a metaphor of an alien planetMan's inhumanity to man in his pursuit for wealth - this is totally symbolic of the European settlers in North America and South America and in the Middle East too where man considers himself better than others indigenous to to the land and will destroy everything in their midst in the pursuit of their desire for the wealth of the landIt's a David vs Goliath battle with modern weapons versus nature .You find yourself torn for your loyalties as traditionally we are taught that the aliens and the baddies and the terrorists and eco warriors are the baddies but you find this moral dilemma disturbing as you feel twisted against the moral maze and the propaganda your fed it's all incredibly metaphorical.You forget you're watching a film you forget that nothing is real you forget it's all animated - that's the magic of Cameron - Cinemas most successful director of all time with Titanic making its 25th anniversary comeback and him hitting another $2bn plus in box office receipts - I didn't see it in 3d but I'd like to but even in 2d it's a visual feastIt's only drawback is it's too longPad. A 8/10.
"This is honestly and arguably the most beautiful movie, in every way i have ever seen, together with the first Avatar movie.Its unbelievable how far we have come with movie technology and that realism strongly makes the emotional impact ever larger. You get emotionaly moved with these masterpieces and it really shows mankinds true human nature, in a sad way.It is one of the greatest movies i have ever seen in my whole life and i cant belive it's gonna be three more movies in the Avatar universe franchise.It is two movies that everybody needs to watch and it's genuinely amazing and simply beautiful!"
"Mr. Cameron is an accomplished director. Very weak movie. The script looks like it was written by a child. Apart from 30% other effects, nothing differentiates it from Avatar 2009. I gave my money to the cinema and it won't happen again next time. I'm sorry that the cinema sinks to the bottom with all its might...
After watching the movie I asked myself the question WHY is there tons of iron in all of Cameron's movies? No progress in 40 years of business...that's why I say he's completely exhausted about filmmaking. Once again, I apologise...
With such a colossal budget for a film, I would personally drown in the ocean where it was shot.End."
"As others have wrote, I am not sure anyone cares about Jake Sully and his family as much as James Cameron thinks they do. I have never really understood the fascination with Avatar, so I had no expectations going in to seeing this. The visuals many people are impressed by felt like watching 3 hour intro to a computer game, while the story and dialogue makes for a paper-thin and painfully boring story that is predictable, shallow and clearly lacks character development.As one of the biggest grossing films ever, the franchise seems all about making an ""easy"" buck, but it's all been done before and lets hope the general public start investing in real stories with real emotion soon."
"I'll start with the headline: The 3D didn't amaze me like it did for the first Avatar, and I felt like the color of the movie was muted by the RealD-3D glasses. The move has so much beauty and color! Do yourself a favor, and DON'T wear glasses that will cut this out!The movie itself is fine. If you're like me, you vaguely remember the first one and remember that it's simple enough to jump right back in - and The Way of Water sticks with the formula that you (vaguely) remember. It's an accessible movie themed around family and home, with some beautiful visuals (again, don't choose 3D over brightness and color) and some forgettable acting (and some distinctly not so good - Spider stands out, but maybe more so because he isn't blue). The plot is unsurprising (there a couple of holes to move it along), the runtime feels a bit padded, and the villain is all talk. But none of that surprises you, probably. You remember Avatar as something that was fun to watch in the theater, and - in that sense - The Way of Water Delivers."
"3h war movie with so much violence, killing and weapons. Showing off of American domination over everything and everyone not just on Earth on real life but even on another planet. Acting is avarage, 3D is avarage. Quite shallow feeling of 3D effects even in IMAX. And as usual 3D and lot of fast scenes do not go together. Music is terrible, cutting short as scenes changes, changing to rapid. SFX avarage. Rocket sounds in space. Really? We still do that? 3 years in making? Maybe rendering took 2.5 years. And water again. People on a sinking ship trying to survive. Sounds familiar? Movie could have last 45min tops. Rest is just filling blanks with long unnecessary scenes. Al in all truly disappointed."
"For the visual part the movie deserves pure 10. But the story... and context mistakes... story mistakes... pure disapointment. Worth watching because it's beautiful. But dont expect much as far as the movie story goes. The mistakes that are made in this movie are unforgivable. The whole first 2/3 of the movie you are building something... which bay the way also has mistakes and holes in the story... BUT... you spend 2/3 of the movie building something... let's say an enviornemnt (so not to spoil anything to anyone), and you throw that away in a second. Not to mention the character degradation that you have spend the entire first movie to build."
"Not sure my review is going to say much new.Fantastic visual experience. It does pull you in and you forget that what you are looking at is not real but art. I never would have believed this was possible back in 1990 or something.It is aimed at children and nerds I think. It is jam packed with Hollywood clichés... Which I think is part of the humour. The story itself is so predictable it becomes a kind of joke. The children disobey the adults and go get themselves into trouble some 4 or 5 times... why do tribes people from Pandora Wagammama and ancient Nigeria all show their hostility by showing their teeth and hissing like a cat... then there is the war cry where they all waggle their tongues and go ""ak ak ak ak"". Sonically, sound effects these days are identical to sound effects from 1992. Why is that? All explosions sound exactly the same.It is fantastic, harmless entertainment. The whole point of the story is to give cue to battle and discovery scenes that are pretty trite and formulaic: hold the child hostage is a waste of time cos I am so slow in pulling the trigger that I might as well have committed hari kiri in minute 12 of the film.But one cannot help but marvel at the incredible artistic, visual achievements. Would I watch it again? If you strapped me to a chair and held my eyelids open with match sticks."
"What a big disappointing movie. Fantastic visuals and sound effects. But the story telling is like elementary school. Everything what happens, every character acting, every plot whole after plot whole happens because the story wants it. Poor writing and no sense for Lore or consistency.Why this bad guy is back ?Why he is mary sue ?Why the Navi act like humans ?Why firearms still cant hit a sh**?Why they live near the water ?Why he knows that he is not hiding in the woods?Why the kids fight in the end instead of other warriors ?Why you have to watch kids diving around for 1 hour ?Gimme me a break ? You seriously bring 3 more of this stuff ? Avatar 1 was good and in its simple story at least with sense and a bit logic.Summary: Because the story wants it.Imagine Cameron would put this budget and effects into a ""Terminator Future War Saga"" with a great storybook!"
"I am not a fan of avatar movies and from a more neutral standpoint I still had to say that this movie is utterly boring. Sitting through watching this hippy tripstering ""orgy about water"" was very disappointing. The movie is seemingly targeted at kids and deaf people who is used to make up her/his own script. I was watching the movie with a friend and he couldn't help but fall sleep. He did for 3 times and his snorting is too strong so we left for the sake of the audience who actually were less than 10 people. I couldn't care less on leaving behind something that was as dull as pain; not even 3D glassed helped out ... And I can't believe that someone is able to write a review is yet rating this movie as 10 stars. Lightstorm Entertainment did a job but James Cameron
did not. I Just would recommend James Cameron to give up on this franchise because is a master piece at flopping."
"Visually stunning. Cutting edge animation. That's the good bits out of the way. The story is weak, characters are predictable and to be honest should have been wrapped up in 40 minutes. Cameron's vision should've been left alone yet you'll have to put up with his narcissistic vision of Pandora.The only redeeming feature of this fantasy is that it explores the subject of whaling and the killing of a species for personal gain. It still falls short as it doesn't connect emotionally with any of the deaths in the film.Avatar 3 has a release date of Christmas 2024, let's hope its put back to 2034 as I can't take anymore of james camerons nonsense."
"James Cameron's Avatar: The Way Of Water, is cinematic masterpiece. It is an absolutely brilliant movie, that showed the insane amount of effort put into the film. James Cameron has definitely lived up to expectations. The dedication put into developing underwater motion capture has paid off, with breathtaking underwater scenes that feel extremely realistic and natural.Not only was the cinematography stunning, the movies plot and world building were enjoyable and immersive. Keeping you glued to the screen and on edge about what will happen next. While some of the scenes resembled the first movie, most of the movie was fresh and exciting.Highly recommend watching. You will not be disappointed."
"Rating: 7.0Jake and Neytiri learn the hardships of parenthood, and their children learn the hardships of tribalism firsthand. The presentation was groundbreaking like the original and it was nice to see Quaritch back as a more calm and collected villain with some nuance now that his son is in the mix. Other than that this movie really isn't anything great, lots of plot conveniences: Payakan saving Lo'ak's life for no reason, Kiri's unexplainable ""jellybending"" ability to save her mom in the ship, etc.. The Navi seem to forget that there are Gill mantles that allow them to breathe underwater and never take them on raids or anything just in case someone drowns. Can't count how many times Navi like Jake and Quaritch drown but are then perfectly fine when brought to the surface. It also doesn't make sense how or why Jake requested human help to save Kiri after her seizure when those guys were all the way in the forest did he just do a round trip? How did they even get here so fast? Did he forget he's being tracked? (this ended up leading Quaritch to him). Kiri's father may be an interesting plot thread in the sequels but it might've just been a virgin birth from Eywa explaining her connection to everything."
"I recognized james camerons incredibly works Alien movies features such as gunships , robotic armors, machines and cave textures And ujique marine life forms are also great work. But script is nothing and using bow like Predator movies Prey's protagonist they have 100% accurate and full of penetration. And why avatar risk theyr life to took human weapons such as automatic rifles after still keep using bows and arrows, spears primitive weapons. What happens with Sea Avatars group in the end? Where were they? Wakanda Forever is much much better than this. What they have purpose to fight each other? Just for his family? Or just for revenges? Or to take miracle medicines? Suddenly Asian humans hunts down whales in the middle of battle with for immortality medicine ? All scripts are going wrong its like made by randomized. And One of human called as monkeyboy or spiderboy(why call this? Another racism for Asian? Poor acting and naming)and i don't get it why he is so many times switching sides friendly or foe and boss villan is also blue so disappointed. And why so looong sequences? Tooo maany National Geographic like scenes or just meaning less and have no relation of main story scenes. Even action scenes are nothing new features its sooo normal. And zero gore scene(just a little couple seconds take by far far away. Is not counted)I watched mx4d 3d. I watched can't stay of complete end roll . I regret selected this already. I don't recommend it. Watch on normal screen or just wait for release on web streaming is enough. If you want to play with ocean life go to play HTC Vive Steam VR game called ""TheBlu"" you also can touch with them play with them and of course it is 3D. Its almost 6 yeas ago already released so Nothing new specific features. Can't believe other great reviews and took about 10 years to finish this. And this time why doesnt have Michelle Rodriguez? I thought she love whales and dolphins?Except Shigourny. Weaver or Sam. W other characters hard to reconnized who is who. And play by S weaver character Kiri is a teenage kid with ages female voice its just little a bit odd? Yes of course she is not teenage. All of Faces made by cgi but forgot fix voice tones?I felt asleep even in mx4d.I hope no more Avaters. I can't believe they have plans to sequels. Nexttime no more Humanoid's characters. Just make one of only those Extraterrestrial marine ocean life's movie like an aquarium. I love those beautiful animals and nature. Human and Avater please keep do nonsenses civil wars and both sides are not survive. After Ocean lifes would be happy ever after and make one of sequel of them."
"This appears to have been written by a group of 6th form English students. The baddies are basically US Marines engaged in raping the world of the peaceful Navi/Navajo/Vietnamese for its rare, um, somethingorother/ for no particular reason. ALLEGORY, huh! The characters do things for no sane reason (we are being attacked in the forest, endangering our forest brothers and sisters, we shall go to the coast and endanger our sea brothers and sisters - we must track down and kill this bloke and his family because, er, don't really know - some of us will be human with boats and harpoon guns and stuff and some of us will be avatars - Mowgli will be in it, for no particular reason). Copycatting abounds. I spotted Stagecoach, Apocalypse Now, Moby Dick, Pocahontas, Titanic (I suppose plagiarising your own film is OK), The Poseidon Adventure, the Jungle Book and High Noon. I'm certain there were more. It did look nice for about half an hour, though, until I got bored.They've already made Avatar 3. Good luck getting anyone to come and see that."
"In my opinion: this movie was outstanding. The visuals blew my mind, to the point where I had to adjust to them at the beginning. There was not a single scene that I didn't find riveting; the time just flew by. So many emotional scenes. I almost cried! I found Sigourney Weaver's performance utterly transcendent - give her an Oscar please!!! All of the acting was super and hers was phenomenal. The movie is, as I said, on another level, beyond my expectations and I will highly recommend to everyone to go and see it. I'm so excited for Avatar 3, 4 and 5. And new movie legacy hopefully.The music was also great and I think that really added to the ambience. I loved the water theme too. So brilliant."
"After 12 years waiting for the ""technology to catch up."" What we got was a disappointing sequel. The Way of Water requires you to rely on its sequels to look past it's own plot holes. Unoriginal story, safe, unnecessarily long and plagued with disposable dialogue. The movie felt less epic in almost every way compared to the first Avatar. You have sit through an hour (1/3rd into the movie) before the under water capture technology is finally introduced for a debatable CGI improvement over the first film.Despite it's several flaws the movie was entertaining enough and importantly had a crucial message on the effect we are having on our beautiful oceans and the creatures who live inside."
"Well, my reaction to this way over-long movie was exactly as I figured it would be. This is worse than the original. Avoid at all costs. The first was a major disappointment and over produced. This one is worse. It is a result of the swollen ego of its director and producer. Younger people often complain about a movie being 'too long', unless it is one of those superhero movies that can go on and on and on. Well, this one does - way too long for a movie so short on plot. However, watch the box office take of this turkey since the younger crowd seems to think that this is classic film making. Avoid. Avoid Avoid."
"The special effects are top notch & superior to the original. The story moves on many years after the first one. If this doesn't get nominated & win awards for the visual effects then this is an injustice. The visual rollercoaster is a delight throughout.However, this masks the major shortfall of this film which is the script. There are lessons about friendship, tolerance & defending one's family. That humanity's greed in spite of their destructive nature to this world is the enemy in this film. The avatar family preachers about the pacifist lifestyle but, when push comes to shove, then this is put to its ultimate test... This kind of reminds me of that late Robbin William's in Peter Pan when captain Hook kills his friends...It has been 10 years in the making and Kudos to the team that our their endless efforts to ensure that the animation is spectacular until the end. If only they spent more time on the storyline then this could have been the film the audience had longed for..."
"Very excited when I first saw teaser of Avatar 2 The way of water but trailer was not good,
Finally I watched part 2 and got disappointed. James Cameron Avatar (part 1) had a magical connection like all his previous movies connected with audience amazing storyline outstanding visual effects
but Avatar Part 2 The way of water gave a opposite experience during the whole 3 hours none of us got connected to the storyline. Overall during the movie we were just waiting for it to finish, we were not interested/ invested in the characters after first 10 mins.It's heartbreaking to call Avatar 2 disaster, this is the least recommended movie and most disappointed movies 2022 Topper :("
"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The story is, well there is no story, it's a set uo for the next movi that I will not watch. The dialogue is cringe and made up of random annoying sounds. Visual effects are not at all fascinating, in fact they are quite average. The character storylines and development make no sense, especially Jake. It is too long 3 HOURS OF MY LIFE I WILL NEVER GET BACK. I don't know how James Cameron can live with himself after having made this, concidering his other movies are gold compared to this. I'm ashamed that I fell for the marketing of this film and can't get over how bad it is so I decided to vent in this review. Thats all. :)"
"I don't know why people have rated this film so low. Ok, I was confused at the beginning and it did seem a bit of a stretch to bring back the baddies from the first film in the way they have, but as soon as I accepted that aspect, it was brilliant from then onwards. Who doesn't want to see alien whales and Maoris battle evil humans who are killing for money?! Plus the graphics - breathtaking! Had me on the edge of my seat for most of the film and of course it has set us up for the next film, which must be the epic battle to make sure humans never come back. Who will we meet next - will we get to see sky and cave environments too? Time will tell. Anyone who criticises it representing a nature documentary clearly has missed the point - it is supposed to."
"Avatar 2 is a tough one. On one hand, the visual effects in this movie are superb. From the Navi people, to the spectacular scenes filmed underwater, to the score -- this movie is a technical masterpiece. With that out of the way, the problems start trickling in.On the other hand, there are a couple of things really keeping this movie in muddy waters. It's 3 hours & change which is a bizarre decision by Cameron when you consider the attention span of an average movie goer. The flick does an above average job with its character development but suffers from another mildly dull storyline; which could have been a lot better had it been trimmed shorter.This installment in the Avatar series seems yet again like a played out story. With the effects in mind, this is a great choice for children and young parents. Whether or not it merits a watch for an adult.... is up in the air on this one."
"Creativity loves constraint. What does a film look like when a creator is given unlimited time and money to make their movie? Avatar: The Way of Water, is the long awaited sequel to the highest grossing movie of all-time. With a film so big, a review can be summed up pretty simply: If you liked the first one, you'll like this one.The movie follows all the basic plot points of the original. Just replace the theme of saving the rainforest with saving the whales.Let's talk about what this one does better than the first. There isn't the tired cliché of the liar reveal, ""at first I was trying to trick you, but then I fell in love."" That stuff is replaced with different clichés, but at least that one is gone. The way the big bad guys attack our heroes is far more visually interesting. As opposed to just missiles and explosions, this time they use little submarines, crab robots, spears, it is a far more complex process. Also, the whales are more interesting than the trees. The whales are more expressive, engaging and feel more like legitimate characters as opposed to simple McGuffins.On the negative side, this film is longer than the first, and it does feel longer as well. A lot of the movie is just absorbing the world and feeling the vibes. There is a lot of wasted time in the movie. Some of the material is introducing dangling plot threads to be resolved in later sequels. The movie repeats a lot of the same beats of the original. Same villain, same evil humans wanting to harvest natural resources, and even the same fish out of water, (or in water) story. The main villain's whole motivation is one word ""revenge"". The teen angst of the children and bullies to the newcomers are frustrating to watch. And there are some character decisions towards the end that make absolutely no sense.But, if I am going to mark down the movie for repeating the bad, I should still give credit to the movie for repeating what works. The visuals are still a sight to be seen. Every scene is filmed with 3D in mind and it is glorious. Just when you think the 3D visuals are getting stale, the movie heads under water and it starts really looking spectacular. Along with the visuals, the action is very well handled. Let nom man say that James Cameron can't do action.It is more of the same, and a little bit better. I just wish a greater portion of the effort put into the visuals and action would have went into a novel story and compelling characters."
"It is sad to see another potentially great movie fall into the same typical hollywood deadend. Many scenes showcasing the planet and wildlife were amazing, beautiful, but then to bring about the same crap of guns, people, animals getting killed, was really predictable and uneventful and sadly just a little too much, flying pieces of arms, killing a mother and her calf, it could have been so much more, perhaps Cameron could watch Valerian and take note of the Pearls.It was a copy cat story of the first one, no evolution or development of a rich story line. This will be a great movie for shallow people that like to hear bangs and booms and enjoy free violence."
"Visuals look good. Action scenes are good. That's about it.For me a good story means everything. I highly enjoy Terminator 2. I was engaged and is that the end of my seat. This show is better special effects than Terminator 2 does but because of the story and some of the characters they really just didn't have me hanging at the edge of my seat. I could honestly have care less if certain characters died. I felt annoyed with the kid interactions that we see so many times in lesser budgeted movies. The spider kid especially annoyed me. He is a human and he lives with both the humans and the natives but for whatever reason if you're trim is if he's been living like a Savage is entire life.Take Jake for example. He was a human turned to Avatar and lives with the natives and yet he still maintains his sanity as a human. Maintains composure. Still has a conscience. Spider kid when he gets captured by humans goes off the rails and starts banging on the window and showing his teeth like he's some kind of beast. But he knows the cultures of both the sophisticated and the Savage. So naturally the sophisticated side should stick.I know from experience because I lived in a third world country where you had natives mixed with those from outside of that country. If the natives only knew their native tongue and they did not know English, their culture ran deep within them and they were more to act like savages respecting no boundaries. However, the natives that new English fluently respected boundaries and were naturally more sophisticated and had an intelligence about them that far exceeded that of their natives brothers and sisters. Because of this spider's character was very unrealistic. I just didn't enjoy his character.And like other reviewers have mentioned, there are things left hanging with the plot."
"Avatar: The Way of Water is a manufactured special effects showreel that stretches its repeated environmental message over a 3-hour-long runtime.This sequel is undeniably gorgeous and technically surpasses its predecessor. The special effects are meticulously detailed and the money is all on the screen. The water looks wet and whatever's swimming swims swimmingly.Unfortunately, The Way of Water's witless and humorless story falls behind its visual magnificence. In a retread of the colonialist outsiders vs the natives' story from the first Avatar, Jake Sully and his wife Neytiri and their family, learn about Pandora's ocean subculture like Jake did last time in the forest.Dripping in corporate saliva, the film devotes all its time like a scheming illusionist seductively teasing the audience to step into Pandora, so it can dazzle them into funding a third film.Suffice it to say, I did not connect with Avatar: The Way of Water. I cannot buy into this world. The marines all talk in tough guy clichés. The good guys are super good and the bad are super evil. I do not get how any of the human scientists don't giggle over saying ""Unobtainium"". But there's more to it...Beneath all the world-building, colorful creature designs, and pioneering special effects, I do not inherently believe that James Cameron is a tree-hugging nature lover who believes that all life is connected through the joining of tails.Cameron claims to be an ocean lover, but that sentiment is muted by the film's corporate sensibilities.The Way of Water's environmental message is repetitive and one-note. It's not the sentiment itself but the way it is cheaply used. Whenever a conflict happens, the script manipulatively plays that environment card to hook the audience into the plight of the Na'vi like, ""Why can't anyone leave these blue cats alone?""Throughout James Cameron's career, technology has been a prominent role and theme in his films, whether it's the mind-blowing special effect of the T-1000 from Terminator 2, the mech suit from Aliens, actors diving underwater for The Abyss, the recreation of the Titanic sinking or the deep sea exploration in his documentary work.In my head, James Cameron is closer to the tech-driven human villains in his own film. The director's true nature seeps through The Way of Water and consistently takes me out of the story.For example, the visual designs for the ocean Na'vi people were all drawn from Pacific Islander cultures. All that reminds me is the actual Pacific Islanders in real life who had their culture decimated by colonization throughout history. I am too aware of the design for it to have its intended dramatic effect on me.When the film asks the audience to sympathize with the Na'vi and their homeland being destroyed by resource-stealing colonizers, it feels disingenuous. The story is asking for a sentiment from the audience that the storyteller does not possess himself. I hate to say this, but there's no real soul in Avatar: The Way of Water.As bitter as I sound, I am genuinely happy for anybody who enjoyed this film. I watched it with my family -I insisted we see it in 2D. They enjoyed it immensely and notes were compared in a civil fashion afterward. Even the children at my theater enjoyed it in a rollercoaster type way albeit being completely drained when the credits rolled.I was bored out of my mind and it felt like an eternity. I figure I might be biased. After all, the first Avatar also brought us 3D cinema, which theater chains used as a ploy to charge more money by front-loading a new release with 3D-only screenings, forcing people to watch a dimmed image for the next 5 years.I genuinely hope for Avatar to end and pray that moviegoers will not be ransomed into wearing 3D glasses again for half a decade."
"The man made Terminator and Titanic!Isn't it tragic, what happens to men, if they become soyboys?Rumor has it, his family jewels were confiscated years ago by Kathleen Kennedy...
That he is calling testosterone a toxin nowadays makes sense.I find it fascinating, how satanic Cultural Marxism, invented by smallhats to destroy European culture, does to the brain and how it brings down Hollywood and the USA itself now.Spending so much money, resources and time on a few lights under water, while being incapable to tell a story, that is not embarrassing for 14 year olds?With Avatar 2 it's over for Cameron. Another victim of Cultural Marxism and a tragic model of the decay of the USA."
"Avatar: Way of the Water is an incredible film that transports viewers to a breathtaking, alien world. The special effects are truly spectacular, making it easy to believe in the world of Pandora and its inhabitants.The storyline is engaging, filled with action and adventure, and explores important themes of environmentalism and cultural conflict. The character building for the Sully's was very well done and took its time to introduce and build a foundation for each character individually. Miles was a captivating villian and felt revitalised as an enemy for the region of Pandora and in particular the Sully family.The performances by the cast, including Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana, are superb. Only criticism is the length of the film, it could of been delivered in 2/2.5 hours and still keep the dramatic effect and character building.Overall, I would highly recommend this film to anyone looking for an immersive and thrilling cinematic experience."
I Couldn't believe what I just watched today !! I know it's harsh to rate 1 outta 10 to the most watched or atleast one of the most watched movie's sequel!!SCRIPT IS ALWAYS THE KING!!Not the VFX.. MUSIC... OR ACTION!!And this movie had NO SCRIPT / STORY to make a sequel on !!I mean disappointment is NOT A WORD to Justify my experience of this movie !!Expectations were 10 out of 10 and movie was a biggest let down of all time !!WHY DID THEY EVEN MAKE A MOVIE WITH NO SCRIPT TO TAKE THE STORY FORWARD????!!!!!Too long .. stretchy and had NO STORY / SCRIPT TO MAKE A MOVIE ON!!It was like watching a documentary on sea life !!!
"It has been 13 years since the original Avatar became one of the highest grossing movies in history. It was a huge spectacle with a new planet, Pandora; indigenous people, the Na'vi; motion capture performances and a lot of never-before-seen technology. The plot was pretty basic, but the impact of the all the technical impacts made it more than the sum of its parts. Here, we are all these years later and finally the long-awaited sequel has been released. James Cameron has submerged us in the waters of Pandora for the first of many sequels called Avatar: The Way of Water.As a quick refresher, at the end of Avatar, Jake Sully, who was human in Avatar form, becomes part of the Na'vi. He's fallen in love with Neytiri and her people. Years later, we find Jake Sully living a peaceful life with his family in the forests of Pandora, but the threat of the sky people's return looms. Of course, that threat comes to destroy Jake's family's peace. Jake must work with Neytiri and the army of the Na'vi race to protect their home. Blue combat hijinks ensue.Now, everything about this movie screams big screen viewing. We have James Cameron, a long delay since the first movie, awesome tech and CGI, big fight scenes etc. This highly imaginative movie just lacks imagination. Yes, that seems contradictory to state, but it's the best way to describe what's going on here. For such a long delay for this sequel to come, Cameron and crew failed to use those years to expand upon the Avatar universe and tell a more interesting story. While we're dealing with slightly new creatures that live in the water rather than the forest, the plot is basically the same as the original. The real question is whether the new technology that's been developed and utilized in making The Way of Water makes this movie worthwhile. I'm fairly ambivalent about it.On one hand, the spectacle of the effects is truly stunning. The water is so blue and clear. The colors are dazzling. Your eyes can barely keep up because there is something new to see, it seems, in every frame. There are animals that we haven't seen before that dominate the screen. Those animals have personalities of their own. The integration of real human performances with the motion capture performances is pretty seamless as well. There really isn't anything wrong with the look of Avatar: The Way of Water. Also, when the action kicks into high gear 90 minutes into the movie, the tension and momentum take over and make the last 90 minutes sail by.On the other hand, when a movie is 3 hours long, it would be great for it to be at least a little unpredictable. It feels like every beat of the story is either a carbon copy of what happened in the original or it is a predictable extension of what's to come. Furthermore, the obvious environmental theme is not very subtle. It is good that the filmmakers have a point of view and that this crazy, action spectacle has something to say about our world, but does it have to be so obvious? Really, 3 hours to tell this story??? No, sir! Not necessary.Ultimately, the wait for Avatar: The Way of Water was worth it. The technology and effects that are used to bring this movie to life are truly spectacular. The story itself is not as imaginative as the tools used to tell it. Also, you have to sacrifice 3 hours of your day to this. The movie should be seen on the big screen - that's pretty obvious - but an early matinee should suffice. Get a bowl of popcorn and you might need another snack to tide you over."
"Subplot on top of subplot and everyone has a kid now? I cared more about the villain and his arc then Jake and his nonexistent arc. Why was I supposed to care for the son that had no plot besides being the ""golden child?"" His death was a weak attempt for us to care for him and give his brother a bigger arc even though he as almost all of the plot. The adopted daughter is definitely a setup for the next movie that I wished they cared more for in this one.Overall meh plot but a fantastic visual. Hopefully the next one will have a better plot, third time is the charm, right? Please James you can do better, I believe in you."
"13 years ago I was dragged along with my friends to an IMAX theater to see a cartoon movie about blue people. That's all I knew about the movie. It ended up being the most immersive movie experience I ever had. Fast forward to now... I just left the theater after watching the new Avatar in 3D and I feel like a little kid again. James Cameron has done it again. Wow that was incredible. For a movie that's over 3 hours long, it sure didn't feel like it. The underwater visuals are nothing I've ever seen before. It felt like I was looking through a window and seeing everything in real time. It really is an incredible experience. GO SEE THIS MOVIE IN 3D!"
"We all expected the sequel to the most visually groundbreaking movie of all time to be a piece of beauty, and it indeed brings a tear to your eyes just looking at the first few shots of the film. Rendering has come a long way since the original, and the cinematography does everything possible to keep up with the new possibilities. The environments are incredibly dynamic, as forest gives way to sea, and dusk, daylight, and starlight make the set feel real and fantastical at the same time. And let's not even start on the visual effects in the piece...But the best element of the movie was always going to be Cameron's storytelling mastermind. The script had to achieve two main goals: letting go of the original movie and paving the way for those to come, while always being a standalone masterpiece. So, after a brief, pace-setting first act, we enter the second one, where we really get to live with the sea people, experiencing the dangers of nature but also their connection to it. This is what life on Pandora is like, this is the core of these stories.Then we hop in the ""third act"", that huge action sequence. And this is where the director shows why he's one of the best, if not the best action writer of all time. The man has completely reimagined whale hunting, throwing in it a ton of high-concept fictional elements, and yet he presents them to us in utmost simplicity, in the easiest of ways to follow. We are presented with the hunt of the mother sea creature, where we're briefed of what the arsenal of the brilliantly-designed hunting ship is capable of, while watching a well-paced, interesting action sequence. And then, all those elements come together to form the ending, a high-stake confrontation in a completely surreal, yet so familiar world. Beautiful stuff.One last thing... seeing once again those attack helicopters, that arsenal bird, those mechs, hearing those gunshots... most people design objects, but some really design feelings."
"Yes, I know James Cameron is a great director who is great at delivering stunning visual excitements to the audience in the cinema. But movie is not only about visuals. Creativity, story, messages, dialogues, story telling skills, and more, are part of it. Avatar is nothing but visuals.The story is far-fetched to be an actual story. The villains are single dimensional. The creatures they create are not as imaginative as Avatar 1, not even to compare Star Wars. The messages brought out are so cliche and shallow to be easily forgotten. I can understand it is an all age friendly movie and they want to deliver some good messages to the children. But it doesn't mean it can be that cliche, see what Pixar can do as children movies maker?Maybe that's the reality of box office, to get a box office success with an average, bland story. But i really doubt such story can attract people to watch Avatar 3,4, or more."
"It was uneven. The action scenes were very cool and so was the look of the movie, but the story doesn't make much sense and it was a little too long. It wasn't as good as the first. Some of the characters were reincarnated as na'avi. None of the characters were originally human and then wearing an avatar suit. Also, the character Spider being the villian's son doesn't make sense. Who's the wife? The scene where the liquid comes out of the humpback whale which makes you ageless was completely abandoned and would have been cool if that was mentioned more. How did Jake's son get wounded and killed? How could the villain return unharmed after Jake broke his neck in the final fight? Why have the rest of the story take place a year after the opening? Spider looked much younger within a year."
"Following up after Avatar was always going to hard, as I feel like the first didn't need a sequel. Like the original this film is breathtaking to look at, and since I love the sea I was perhaps more astounded by this imagery than last time. Unfortunately the story is weaker this time around, and harder to justify since I'm one of the few who liked the original's plot. Neytiri is also sidelined in this film, which I found disappointing since she was a standout in the first.Jake Sully now has a family with Neytiri, two son's and two daughter's; followed by an adopted son. The family dynamic is the core strength of this film, however the children themselves are a mixed bag. The story relies so much on them getting into trouble that it becomes annoying, however there are some scenes which ALMOST make you forgive them for this.The action and effects are just as amazing as the original's, but unfortunately this film is still very much the same as the first. I wanted to feel what I felt during the original, but unfortunately I didn't, and even though I wasn't bored, I wasn't as invested either. If the third film does happen, I hope there's changes made to make it more engaging.This film is longer than the first however it's not noticeable, all though five or ten minutes extra would've pushed it. There are quite a few scenes which I disliked in the movie, like a certain pregnant Navi riding off into battle, but overall I liked it; however I can't say I'm enthusiastic about another one."
"Well I said it 13 years ago. There is nowhere easy to go with this story. It was an ET moment and thank god they never did a sequel to that.It's possible, but it would take some writing to make it really worthwhile.Apart from doing what they have done, bring back the sky people. They had to as there is nothing else to do.Ok there are elements I didn't see coming, but I didn't think that it would ever get released.Overall this is a very good film. But sequel to what I thought was a masterpiece, well no, it's not hitting the spot.Maybe time has moved on and once we have seen it, we've seen it.Perhaps the story doesn't matter and we just want stunning visual effects.It is way too long and could have lost 50 minutes with good storytelling. But, then he couldn't have shown off his fx.What is full of stunning visual effects doesn't make up for far more lost opportunity in storytelling. Getting back the message of harmony, balance and the symbiotic relationship of all life.It doesn't have to be political or dark. But it has to be able to make kids stand up and know that what we are doing to this planet is the same as the sky people are to Pandora.Go see it, expect to miss some for toilet breaks. Get a little bored and then come out feeling OK, you watched a pretty good film.To make 3 possiblly worth it, I'm not so sure."
"Okay, first I will get it out of the way, this movie is visually brilliant and shines with its production. I'm glad I saw it in 3D. Plus, much of the action (mainly on and in the water) was well-done and as far as special effects and good action sequences, I can always count on James Cameron to deliver. But that's not enough to make a movie great.Now onto the definite flaws/problems. This movie does NOT need to be over 3 hours long and much of the middle with the Reef clan drama bored me so much. It was a little weird how they brought back Stephen Lang's character too and maybe some of the scenes with him were good but they should've made a different villain debut instead. They missed so much creative opportunity with that. I didn't like how they chose to bring him back in the end YET AGAIN with him being saved to keep his character going and man, Spider is such an annoying nuisance of a character! He only served a purpose in one scene (the stand off with the knives to the throats) but that's it! I did not care about him at all. Plus, am I the only one who got the brothers confused because of how much they looked alike?? I can't be. And that made me care even less!Unfortunately I have to rate this below the first one, which felt fresher and was much better building a new world. It felt newer, grander, and more significant with introducing a whole planet and the main forest species instead of just part of a planet with another part of the species, and in many ways this one felt so recycled and not as special. This is one of the less impressive James Cameron films I've seen and I don't think anything will ever beat Terminator 2 for me. Below average story-telling and characters but looking at it was very pleasant, that's all I'll say."
"I am 36 years old and for the first time in my whole life I was thinking of leaving the theater after two hours of this completely empty visual spectacle...My wife wanted to finish it, so we did. And we both regret it.Visually? Beautiful. But thirty minutes of that is enough. Watch 30 minutes, walk away, you'll love it.Honestly it is very easy to cut the runtime in half. The amount of loose ends, meaningless arches and the absolutely unempathetic characters (new and old) turned a bad movie into a torture for the last 60 minutes.It is that bad.Worst movie I remember watching in theaters was Dreamcatcher, this one took its place."
This movie is absolutely terrible. Disgusting and shameless use of CGI and literally ripping off scenes from the first movie over and over again. It is needlessly 3 hours and it does not matter whatsoever. 13 years and no progress made in story telling makes me question James Cameron and what made this movie so bad. I believe there are good movies and there are bad movies. This movie enters a new category of movie which has never existed before: Bottom of the Mariana trench terrible. This movie was made with a newly formed AI algorithm that we have never seen before to make an absolutely atrocious movie that rips off the first and leaves it feeling soulless. There is animal violence and lots of blue people no one cares about. Stay far away from this awful movie. Shame on you James Cameron. And shame on the evil AI that crafted this garbage pile. You have failed.
"First off: stunning visuals and nice tracks. Can't argue here. It's like watching a nature film filled with incredible new species.The movie as a whole is terrible, however. It is very, very long, and seems pointless.Jake Sully has a family and to protect it from the returning humans he decides to run away from there home with it. In the new place, they blatantly give away their position and so force another confrontation.All of this reeks. The cornel seems absolutely hellbent on killing Jake. We don't know why, it's just a deep hatred.They choose to only bring a small force to fight with, however. This is easily overrun by a single village of Na'vi. In the final battle, the rest of the village somehow just disappear for some reason. We don't know why. They can't help. I guess.The human kid Spider, a supposed friend of the Sully family decides the save the life of the very Avatar that wants to destroy it. He doesn't mention this later when they are reunited. Doesn't make sense.The humans seem completely corrupted by... well, we don't know what really. The earth is dying and so the humans need a new home or at least new resources. Seemingly having learnt nothing, they continue maraudering and killing whales to get some age-stopping nectar. This is worth 80 million just for a few ounces.80 million of what? A dead currency back at earth? What is 80 million worth on a dead planet? What can you buy for 80 million there? Are we meant to believe people just go about killing things for ""money"" - regardless of civilizational stability and what the money actually buys?In the previous Avatar movie, there was an attempt to make you think of the Na'vi as ""wiser"" and intune with nature. In this movie that pretense is just dropped. The Na'vi, and their cousins the sea people, are just another brand of humans. They live the same, they have the same family structure and the same tribal structure. They hunt, they build tools and scour for resources.Essentially Avatar 2 can be skipped and you can just watch a nature film followed by some WW2 documentaries. You would enjoy it more."
"Definitely this movie is a visual treat. The magic of the world building that i felt in avatar was repeated again in avatar: the way of water. Technicaly this movie cannot be any more better, it's just amazing. The performances by all the actors were good. The movie takes lot of time to establish the new water world wich we are introduced in this movie. The underwater sequences were just awsome. The action sequences were also nice, especially the last one hour. Only James Cameron can have such amazing vision of visuals and the way he builds the world and makes his audience just fall in love with that world makes me speechless.One issue I have with the movie is that they used the same antagonist as the first movie and that felt kind of a bit repetative. Some emotional plots work, especially as that of how the sky people use the fish in the ocean. Apart from that the other emotional plots did not seem to work much effectively.I am really curious to know how James Cameron is going to develop this world and what he has in his pocket for the coming installments.Definitely a theater watch experience."
"Do not understand all the great reviews. The movie was basically the same as the first one with the same villain, multiple characters brought back for no reason, a poor new character - Spider I think his name was. Spider's acting was very poor and was the pinnacle of cringey dialogue in this film. Sigourney Weaver's character was a bit of a reach to try and bring her back into the film. The movie is also ridiculously long, I fell asleep for 10 minutes in the cinema and could hear the whole cinema getting restless towards the end. If you really want to see it then maybe watch it at home because it was that unbearable. I feel like maybe they've purchased reviews to get people into the cinemas because this one is no where near the first and the first one didn't even have that great of a story. I was not attached to the new characters either and certain characters kept doing dumb things to get locked up again and again and again. Please do yourself a favour and avoid this movie. Save 3 hours of your life."
"I was never a fan of the first avatar movie and this one had me bored half to sleep with clunky acting and awkward dialogue within the first half hour. The action sequences involving the military were exciting but the jungle and water scenes were really rather dull. Towards the end of the movie, last 45 mins, all I wanted was for it to end. Story easily could've been told in a couple hours.However I was willing to give this movie a chance given the hype around its visual effects and beautiful cinematography. I was disappointed here too. The effects were too vibrant to the point they looked cartoony and I was never fully convinced by the cgi to the point I could ignore it. The landscapes are epic and of large scale but I still feel the world was empty.Poor showing from Cameron."
"Although the visuals at times are incredible, it also looks like a videogame at others. Sets which were fully CGI generated were mostly not convincing, especially during several action scenes. It appears practical items are essential for selling the visuals, which were only used at some times.The main story is decent, but the movie contains so many filler scenes that the story ends up feeling thin. The ending was also quite boring and unfullfilling.Character-wise, Ney'tiri has such a one-dimensional character in this film. An interesting dynamic between Jake and her is completely absent. Also, using Miles again as the antagonist is quite lazy, without adding new interesting aspects to his character.In avatar 1, some interesting themes were included such as showing the negative sides of capitalism and it contained some interesting sights on spirituality, energy and human purpose.Avatar 2 ultimately loses itself into showing off its incredible visuals, and feels like it maybe could be skipped due to its thin story and lack of deeper layers."
"Watched in 4DX which I think masks a lot of the films flaws. Can't get away from the fact that the film looks amazing. This will sound like a contradiction but the first 20 minutes of setting the scene felt too rushed and left me wanting more of a backdrop, however the film felt like it would have been better served being an hour shorter. The middle part of the story was a bit bland and felt unnecessary.I can't help feeling that the leads of Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana didn't really come across as the heroes of the piece but almost like supporting characters. Overall I'm glad I've seen it but I think without the 4DX it might have scored lower - the visuals really do paper over the cracks of the plot."
"There is no denying it: Avatar the Way of Water is absolutely the most beautiful movie I have ever seen. The only way to properly watch this is in a theater (preferably Imax) that's well maintained and excellently sound balanced. The water scenes of Wakanda Forever look like amateur hour compared to what James Cameron pulls off here. I'm ready to watch this again already, and in a perfect world, I would be able to grab about 1,000 desktop background screenshots of this stunning cinematography piece of pure art. I could go on for hours... the stars, the bioluminescence, the creatures, the little freckles... and the underwater scenes? Holy batman. I'm a believer! If I never got to watch a movie ever again, I'd be satisfied that my movie going career ended with this movie.It's like the studio spent 1 billion dollars or something. I mean it's crazy.Unfortunately, while they spent billions on cinematography, they must have run out of money and spent what, like, $5,000 on a story/script? I mean... wow it's a bad story. If you think the 7 8 9 of Star Wars was bad.... welp. I mean it's like Hollywood doesn't even try anymore. ""Here is my message to the world, you WILL watch it and my politics/ideology WILL be obvious.""As a logical thinking person it is extraordinarily difficult not to cringe at nearly every turn of the plot. The entire movie start to finish was 110% predictable. It was Avatar 1, but instead of trees, it's water. Its no longer unobtanium version 1.0, its now unobtanium 2.0. Honestly the story is so bad it hurts. I mean just imagine, if there was another story universe where the rebels fought the bad guys who had this huge base and they just barely blew it up.... and now imagine a sequel to that story... where... the bad guys had an even BIGGER base and the rebels just barely managed to blow that one up to....... you get the idea. Zero originality, zero interesting plot lines, zero ""deep feelings"", zero writing quality at all.Fortunately the visuals are so, so amazing that you can genuinely overlook the utterly abysmal story and just enjoy the movie for the visual and audio artwork that it is.Give me Avatar 3... I'm ready!"
"In the end the Avatar movies stand or fall depending on how you enjoy movies. Avatar has always been about immersion and world building and a light story that doesn't get in the way of said immersion. But a lot of people forget that although characters and story look simple, underneath they have a very important function in that they establish clear goals (similar like Fury Road). Yes, the movie feels very slow in the middle, but I think by taking its time with all the new characters we get a better pay-off for the final act. Most of the story and conflicts are quite predictable, and I wish it would have a little more surprises here or there. But it is undeniably a very good looking movie with a lot of attention to detail. It's truly rare to see carefully crafted images like here.I saw a 3D screening and although not my choice I was impressed with what they have done in terms of depth. The action set pieces are also very well crafted except maybe one (the shark chase was tedious and repetitive). Bringing back the colonel felt a bit cheap at first but it's safe to say that Cameron has something more interesting in store for this character in the next movie. The kids probably too, we spend a lot of time with them and their hardships. I can imagine that this will be paid of in subsequent movies. The other bad guys are unfortunately very bland. Overall the movie has very similar flaws like it's predecessor, so if you don't like the first one this won't be a revelation either. I personally enjoyed it more than the first one because I really can see the hard work put in every frame, and I think the action scenes are better staged and executed. But I would lie if I'd say I wasn't bored at some moments here or there. Overall it was a good IMAX experience but something tells me that it is also a fleeting sensation like the first movie."
"First of all, visually it's not that overwhelmingly stunning like Cameron said it would....most part of the movie was like watching an ocean documentary movie...now here's the confusing parts: 1. How can Grace's avatar be in the tank, while in the first movie, she and her avatar, both were taken by Eywa...2. And what makes it more confusing, her avatar was pregnant, while we all know, Grace was not pregnant when she died, and whos the father??....3. How can Colonel becomes an avatar, and even there's an explanation by the Colonel itself filming about he has a clone that will be made if he was dead, but that is a human clone not an avatar, we all know that to become an avatar there are pnly two ways, first you whether died and your avatar body are both brought in front of Eywa and Eywa will transfer you to become fully an avatar, or second you control the avatar from the tube by neural connection...so is there a real Colonel that controlling the avatar all along, because he said he has a human clone prepared for him, or the writer just dont care about it.....4. Sully has the ability to gather all clans in the planet while they fought the armies at the first movie, but in this movie, he seems like a coward and run like he just met them at the first place, very strange considering he is Toruk Macto.....5. Eywa answered their prayers when things not on their side, by hording all animals from everywhere on the planet to join fight with them against the armies, where is Eywa now??....so it seems Cameron only cares about how his avatars and the environment looks spectacular, while he forgot, he already has the first movie that he must really put a an effort to bring the continuity of the story telling, characters that he must preserve their legacy for this second movie.....and to be honest, after I finished watching it, I feel empty because the story didn't echo in my memory, from a rational standpoint and character standpoint.....if he plans to make a lots of Avatar movies, the first thing you do is you have to make the story right from the first place."
"I was extremely disappointed with Avatar 2. Despite its visually stunning effects, the film was riddled with plot holes and nonsensical plot points. The decision to clone the villain from the first Avatar film was completely unnecessary and added nothing to the story. Additionally, the villain's relentless pursuit of one individual, despite the resources and effort it required, made no sense. Furthermore, the idea of Earth colonizing a planet that their people cannot breathe on is ridiculous.The lack of logic in the film was further exacerbated by the one-dimensional characters and cheap emotional shots, including senseless animal cruelty and pointless sacrifices.The film felt like a waste of time and I was left feeling abused by the experience. Overall, I highly recommend avoiding this film as it is nothing but offensive garbage."
"Decent but not great visual performance. Images are still too fake to be real, 3D effects are bothering most of the time. But I still enjoy the ocean scene quite a lot. Probably the most beautiful ocean scene in animated movies. It's still the reason and the only reason to walk into the theater.Apart from that, role building is very weak in so many characters. In the first place, they surely have huge potential to develop into impressive stories, but none of them meet my expectation. Issue building is weak too. The only issue being developed is family bonds, which in the standard nowadays are far from enough to make a great film. What a disappointment for a long waited sequence."
"An undeniable staple in VFX that is undercut by a weak plot. Awful acting & a terrible script. The score is powerful yet repetitive. The colors are eye-popping but can't overcome a lazy screenplay..

"The imagery is beautiful, the effects and creatures amazing... but the story is so abrurd it's insulting. It seems they weren't able to stay away from the old cowboys and Indians, revenge storyline. Macho guys, bullies, neurotic wives, etremely violent mixed with a sprinkle of weak new age spirituality.I can't believe hundreds of peolpe have worked so hard on making a multi-million production and no one thought of actually telling a good or at least decent story.Sorry but it just doesn't make sense, I remember watching the first movie and really loving it, even though it was also action packed and pretty straightforward...this movie just doesn't cut it."
"I wonder if people even try to give us something new these days. We went to see Avatar 2 in the cinema and I was joking about the storyline with my friends and how it will go. My guess was that they will copy the first movie, Avatar (2009), with more bombs and explosions. Also storyline is very predictable. In the beginning everything was perfect and beautiful, humans came with the guns, big battle, the end. First Avatar was also straightforward but it had something deeper in it. Humans tried to infiltrate, study and resettle the aliens but now they just brought the guns to kill. They even managed do ruin some parts I liked for example when alien boy befriends huge alien whale I thought it was something special and that they will use the whale to fight off humans or something but few minutes later there's 30 whales and everyone got one of their own and they do nothing with them. Pretty disappointing."
"Contradictory, sagging in the scenario plan of the film. The main question is: WHY DID EVERYONE FORGET ABOUT THE TREE OF SOULS?! After all, the whole point of the first film is that if it is demolished, the tribes will die. Why don't they use what is shown in the first minutes after landing, burning the ground? Whale hunting is introduced retroactively, although in the first part people came only for minerals. The son of the villain from the first part is presented, although he was not in the first part. Why does the main villain, who had his memory loaded BEFORE the birth of his son, begin to treat him in such a way that he releases the prisoner? A lot of deus ex machina. But yes, a beautiful picture. For the sake of which the film stretches for 3 hours, although the scenario load there is no more than 1.5-2 hours."
"I have been a huge James Cameron fan ever since his Terminator 2, True Lies, and Titanic. I found the first Avatar to be enjoyable but highly forgettable, with a story that mixed Poncahontas with Apocalypse Now.The long awaited sequel, The Way of Water, is nothing but a very long and very bloated sequel that doesn't really expand the story of the original Avatar and merely exists for James Cameron to use a record busting $400 million budget with a story that is far too long, and far too dull to really expand the Avatar audience.It's fifteen years later, with Jake Sully and his family living on Pandora, Colonel Quarrich returns this time as a Navi warrior hellbent on revenge for his death at the 'end of the original Avatar, after the RDA returns to Pandora to continue their mission from the first film, Sully takes his family from his rainforest villiaage to live among the seaclan of Pandora.The ending is a direct ripoff of Waterworld, with watercraft, submarines and a sinking ship (reminiscent of the Titanic) with machine guns blaring all while it takes nearly two and a half hours to get to the real action.This is simply a one hour film that has been dragged out to well over three hours. The middle portion was downright so dull I checked my watch over a dozen times. I literally struggled to stay awake and while the 3D visual effects are impressive, the effects get old fast and the story is downright BORING at times.All in all we waited for over a decade for an Avatar sequel that is definitely SUBPAR to the original! Wait for this on Disney Plus instead!"
"If you can believe it, Avatar: The Way of Water, the movie a decade in the making, tops the visual masterpiece of the original, Avatar. Be warned that this movie is a commitment as it is over three hours long!Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), the human transformed into a Na'vi person, and his wife Ney'tiri (Zoe Saldaña) are back and now have four kids. With the unexpected return of the wicked Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang), who is brought back as a Na'vi impersonator along with his crew, the Sully's are forced to flee the forest and explore what other places on Pandora, their home planet, have to offer.Since this is the sequel to the mega-hit film, Avatar, I recommend watching the first film before viewing this one, as there are many important references and details that are key to following this film. The storyline leaves us with some more questions than answers; however it sets up moviegoers for the next installments. Viewing it on a big screen, especially in 3D - which I recommend - makes you feel like you're right beside the characters in the world of Pandora. Speaking of Pandora, the world building is absolutely remarkable. It expands our view of this amazing foreign planet. And as the name suggests, it focuses on the islands, oceans and reefs of Pandora. The aquatic plants and animals are majestic and gorgeously iridescent. The reefs and oceans are eye popping and staggering. Everything is so glowy and vivacious. If you thought the animation of the original film was awe-inspiring, wait until you watch this one! The animation is hyper-realistic. When looking closely, you can see the ultra-detailed textures of the characters and settings. The movement almost looks like it is from a cut scene of a video-game (it's honestly the best way I can describe it). Stephen Lang's performance as the Colonel is so powerful, and makes you hate his guts even more than you did in the first film. Sam Worthington as Jake and Zoe Saldaña as Ney'tiri seem to have developed even better chemistry than in the first movie.The message of this movie is to always fight to protect loved ones. This movie also has strong messages about the bonds with family and friends. Be forewarned that there is violence and violence involving animals.I give Avatar: The Way of Water 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. This movie releases in theaters on December 16, 2022. By Katherine S., KIDS FIRST!"
"Seing people rating this movie bigger than 5 proves that visuals are the only thing that matters for some people. Or this was the first movie they saw.Visual there is nothing that anybody can say. The movie is a leap in CGI compare with the last one and years apart from any other movie.The problem is the rest. James Cameron spends soo much time showing the world that you get in love or you want to leave (I'm in the second group). The dialogue was write using every cliché in cinema, and every action is drive by the stupid actions of the same character.3h15 is too much for a movie that probably could be cut in 1h. None of the new character is better that previous movie and the old ones are there only for actions scenes.Go to cinema for the visuals but drink a strong coffee before."
"Half of it was the best national geographic documentary you'll ever see. The other half had an overly simple, average plot.There were even a couple major plot holes and I also thought it was hard to reconnect with what happened in the first Avatar movie. Understanding the crux of the first movie is quite important to understanding the setup of the second one, and it felt like they could have added more explanation given that the first one came out 13 years ago. Maybe read a quick recap before going in.I'm also not too sure how they'll have several follow-up movies from a plot perspective but I could be proven wrong. With all that said, probably still go watch it though, since it has the best graphics you'll ever see on a movie."
"While the movie in it self is visually stunning and extremely well done the lack of interesting story fails to captivate the beautiful world.I've been wondering lately since when did we stop caring about the plot? Just because a movie is visually stunning does it make it good?Avatar 2 use the same formula as so many other movies before it - reusing characters that were thought to be dead and fails to be innovative in any regard concerning the story. The main focus of the movie is the fanservice provided which yes it is very good looking.Jake Sully fails to do any wise decision in the entire movie. He is leading the resistance against the ""new"" human invasion but for some reason he have to leave because apparently the humans only care about killing Jake Sully - The rest of the resistance is ignored, like all their sins are forgotten. This makes no sense - like why did he have to leave at all if he is fighting against the humans anyway?Then his son almost dies and he wants to leave and yeah, they just give everything up and let the humans have their way - Okay, but why were you fighting from the start at all then?Then you have the generic teenage drama with the son who wants to be approved and does stupid stuff in hope of getting approved by his father (daddy issues, oh no how original) 90% of the movie is this son doing bad stuff and getting into trouble pretty much.While Quatrich or w/e his name is died in the last movie apparently they cloned his mind and now he's alive and want revenge or something (hello star wars ep9) which is the other 10% of the movie. Apparently he decides to move and be like a native in his avatar but what effect this have in the movie doesnt really push the plot forward, it's just some unnecesary filler scenes that fills no function considering he goes back to the ""human"" way the next scene anyway with weapons, gunsblazing. He earns noones trust.I could keep going about why I disliked this movie. They have created such a unique and amazing universe and fails to execute an original story that would make sense - A civil war between the natives would have been more interesting than humans coming back so soon for one. But this movie perfectly showcases how Hollywood have dropped it's standards when it comes to basic storytelling. There is nothing original about this movie apart from the fanservice.Only reason im giving this a 4 is because of the CGi and the effects. Thank you for reading the entirety of my review! :)"
"High school level writing, a celebration of nothing and, in the spirit of people who have nothing to say, it takes itself way too seriously.The plot is paper thin, there is no reason for any of the action, no motives and no real story that makes this worth watching or making.It will make a lot of money, because it's James Cameron, it should be wiped from digital archives to save people wasting three hours of their lives.I'd rather watch the Megan and Harry expose twice as a binge session than put anyone through Avatar2. Not to mention the continuation of white saviour syndrome. Not content to save and become the best Navi of the sky, his family now become the best Navi of the ocean.Jesus, just stop it.Absolutely awful."
"2 hours out of 3 hours
is just about water , aqua marines and CGI effects to make it look appealing. It reminded me of my Great Barrier Reef dive . The movie could have been reduced to 1.5 hours easily. Some flaws In the story;1. Why would the hero risk life of sea people by calling the medics ? He acted in a very selfish way. In the end we don't k is if land people were unharmed or if they were attacked by sea people .2. The villain in the end returns back . Perhaps there is one more sequel to the movie.3. Character of spider was half baked. Could have been developed to give a better story line."
"Watching Avatar 2 in a Cinema is an experience. The visuals are one of a kind and truly fascinating. Sadly this was about the only part that made watching this somewhat fun. Lets start with the story, somehow humans returnd to Pandora. Why? What happend to earth? What is the strategy of colonizing the planet? The list of questions goes on. What does Avatar 2 to explain this? Sadly absolutly nothing. They just cut to one year later and all of the sudden there is an resistance group. It makes it nearly impossible to connect with any characters, as we are just forced to aceppet the events. The story then heads to the Waterlands i guess, where the plot takes forever to get going again, there are so many side storys that do absolutly nothing for the plot and the only thing that keeps you from falling asleep are the visuals. But now to the biggest problem i had with the film. The Cahrecters are inexcusably terrible. The absolut worst is the colonel. He has no motivation apart from beieng evil and wanting vangence at all cost. His character is flatter than a pancacke and for me this totally ruined the film. Then the children, their dialogue is terrible they act like your typical american Highscoolers and start every sentence with bro, wich over time just annoyed the heck out of me. The end is somewhat alright in my opinion, but there is just too much action while it is spectecular, at some point enough is enough. And the way the colonel cares for his kid at the end makes just no sense. For the entire movie it looked like they didnt care at all for each other and at the end both risk their lives to save on and other. The film had 3:10 hours to build some kind of connection between the two, but rather decided to cover some wierd bullying/i feel diffrent side plot. So overall i somewhat enjoyed the movie for its visuals. In the cinema i was quite entertained. But if i was to watch it at home again i think my Rating would drop to a 3/10."
"I fell like it could have been shorter. Lots of nonsensical decision making from the main characters causes repetitive situations (with one character even stating: I can't believe i'm tied up again?! Like saying it makes it less cheap).Because I couldn't care less about the ""look how beautiful this is"" scenes I disliked this movie more than other people. I'm sure if you like to watch pretty colours you'll give it at least an 8.Also it is hard to just dismiss how much of a cash grab this movie is. In the sense it is the pinnacle of the let's make a decent movie and milk it with sequels trend that has plagued recent releases.The song composer whale made me crack up quite a bit too be fair."
"This is Garbage movie ever, not at all PG13, this is Rated R, lots of killing animals like big fishes with heavy machine guns, rocket launchers and drill in the fish body. My kids was badly crying. My wife upset after those shots. This is not a Hollywood movie, One whole hours only fish circus, another one hour showing fishes life, half hour torture on fishes and last half hour looks like Pearl Harbor in 2022. Not recommended at all for Kids not even for adults. Saved your money and your priceless 3 hours. Always checked if the same guy did everything like Director, Producer, Writer, Screenplay Writer, never watch those movies. Better than this movie go and watch Heropanti2, another Garbage movie but better than Avatar."
"Lets face it, trilogies rarely get the middle movie right. Either just make two or give your audience some sort of statement. Yes Avatar The Way Of Water must be seen on the big screen, its visually spectacular, but its so long for what it set to achieve.Jake Sully has set up family life on Pandora, suddenly a familiar threat returns. Now Jake must work with Neytiri, along with the Metkayini people to save their home.Many times it gets lost in its own plot. One minute earth is dying and needs Pandora resources, next its sorely about revenge. It's not all terrible, but one can only hope the third is Cameron's masterpiece."
"30 mins of plot in a 3.5 hour film. The film is beautiful as a fictional oceanic documentary on an alien world but tries to put some kind of poorly thought out and badly written mess of a plot in it. The 'villian' magically brought back from the dead shows how lazy and secondary to the visuals, the plot actually is. Just like the first movie - after seeing it once you'll never think about it or likely watch it again.Hopefully the next half a dozen sequels will actually have writers attached and will 'create' some kind of story going forwards but this is doubtful based on the fact the second movie leaves off exactly where the first movie did."
Avatar 2 is sooo freaking awesome! I enjoyed the fight with monkeyboy and the bad guy gets jumped but most importantly it's been 13 years since the first Avatar was released back in 2009!The movie has its dark moments and Very interesting water looking scenes and more of the action packed stuff in it!! Well Glad it was worth the watch at the movie theaters 3D too ! But in the end that one Avatar creature dude dies rip dude. So if you seen the first Avatar here you go with the sequel! I enjoyed it for the most part Monkeyboy was bad White dude actually was friends with the evil bad guy but enjoy it interesting movie of 2022!
"I was really excited for his one .. I really was. But this was a huge disappointment. The graphics and visuals are great and the trailer had me excited so I went to watch this is 4D. Yep. Please do not do that. It was give you a bad bad headache. The movie is too long and that too unnecessarily and sitting there for that long with your chair shaking so much. Thank God nobody threw up. It could have easily been reduced by 30 mins or more. To add to my misery, the screen got stuck 1 hr into the movie and after that the next 15 mins we had to watch it with an audio lag. Not sure how they realized, but they fixed it 15 mins later and moved the film back again from the scene where it had got stuck. So, we had to sit down an additional 15 mins. That is not the movie's fault, however, the movie still is very very long. When Avatar 1 had come out, for its time, the graphics were really cool. But for Avatar 2 given the year we are in, we have seen stuff like this. It cool but not ahead of it time or something unbelievably good. Still I would graphics were good. The biggest let down was the story and the pace of the story telling. There were so many times I was wishing for the film to end. The end fight scene was dragged way too long and for no reason. I did expect a lot since this was a James Cameron film, however for me, this will be my final Avatar at the theatres."
"Graphics were astonishing. The cinematography was astonishing. The film was the worst I have ever experienced.The plot was non-existent, stereotyped and predicable. The cultural appropriation was inexplicable - maori aliens? Really? The acting... average at best. The ending... dear god... when? When will it end? Please God let the movie end. Why has it not ended yet?The movie would have benefited enormously from being a full 2 hours shorter, cutting out the entire middle section and the final 20 minutes could have eliminated.This was comfortably the worst movie I have ever seen. In. My. Life."
"Whether you like this movie or not probably depends on what you expect from a movie. If you are not a fan of the comic-book-mythology genre (STAR WARS, LORD OF THE RINGS, SUPERMAN, etc), this is probably not for you. But if you avidly enjoy films like that, this may be just what you're looking for, because not only does it have all the stock characteristics of such films, it additionally has some thrilling and awe-inspiring 3D special effects. I personally am not a big fan of fantasy films, but I can appreciate the technical wizardry. I don't really care whether the evil whoosies attack the good whatsies and end up ruling the universe, because I'm sure the evil ones will get their comeuppance in the next sequel. Technical elements are spectacular, but I need a story that really interests me and characters that I care about, rather than those that are just generic ""types."" The actors are all buried under tons of makeup, so I cannot vouch for any of the performances, because the actors are severely handicapped by so many facial prostheses. I also feel I should add a word of warning for religious people who are easily offended. In one scene a character says something along the lines of ""Christ, can't you do anything right?!"" (That's not an exact quote, but it's the gist of it.) I ask, what does Christ have to do with a fantasy set in an alternative universe? How do the characters on Pandora know about Christ? A missionary from another dimension? And why did the filmmakers include such a line that they must know is bound to offend many in the family audience. They go out of their way not to offend so many groups, but devout people apparently aren't worthy of such consideration. I personally don't care, apart from the desire to keep things logical within its own framework. And I found it jarring. But if you like this kind of movie, I'd say go see it in IMAX and get the full theme-park-ride experience."
"Maybe I expected too much but I wasn't wrong to have expected more than Avatar... after all it is a sequel and so had to be better than the previous but it is not... Sadly I'm the only one that noticed poor animation in certain scenes that reminded me of ""Adventures of buck wild"".... Visuals were good but many scenes were unnecessarily dragged which made it hard to just sit and watch helplessly... What made me wonder most was that Jake comes with the whole tribe to rescue their children but after 1 or 2 minutes of the operation the other warriors disappear and the fight is left a family matter. The fin-less whale helps though... Similarly no update about 'forest people' after Jake's family leaves itched my thoughts..."
"From the first ten minutes, I knew Avatar 2 was going to be largely what I feared it would be: a disappointingly rote rehash of the themes and plot points of the first film. And it proceeded to be mostly exactly that, with a few exceptional bright spots throughout.Starting with the positives, the action sequences and underwater camerawork are exceptionally well-crafted. It's so vivid and eye-catching, always keeping what's important at the center of attention. When it's time for spectacle, this movie shines brighter than anything else I've seen, even though the film's frame rate frequently shifts between 24fps and 60fps, and it's very distracting.There are quite a lot of characters introduced in this story, and only one of them really stands out: Jake's son Lo'ak. He has a very simplistic character arc but it's largely effective, being efficiently introduced and having a very satisfying, emotional payoff.Unfortunately these are the best things I can praise, because everything else really is just more of the same.They bring back the same dull villains with the EXACT SAME motivations that are uninteresting at best and nonsensical at worst.They bring back the same ""having to learn a new culture and attain acceptance"" arc from the first movie that is entirely devoid of inspiration or nuance.They bring back the exact same theme of ""military exploitation bad"" and the exact same presenting of that theme with the subtlety of a sledgehammer to the face.Even the film's climax just comes across as a scaled-down, beat-for-beat remake of the climax of the first film, with even the same final fight that's predictable and overly long.And what's not new is mostly underdeveloped. I do praise Cameron and co. For trying to explore a new region of Pandora and add new blood to the cast of characters, but a lot that's introduced is presented in the same way as the first movie (riding new creatures, treasuring new resources, etc.).One of Jake's daughters is given an intriguing origin and set of skills, but almost nothing is done with it and it's never explained.As for the screenplay, it's clunkily-paced and the dialogue is...a mixed bag at best. There's a lot of ""get some!"" and ""that was sick, cuz!"" and other such placeholder dialogue that made me cringe into my seat.All the pieces were there to craft a groundbreaking new chapter to this saga, but in the end I rarely felt anything because it feels like unfocused, indecisive filler content to pad runtime while we wait for a more substantive, compelling chapter."
"After waiting so long for the sequel, it finally came out. The first one was really good, and this sequel is too. The digital photography is magnificent and realistic. The story line is good... I think it could have been better. It fell into that logical standard story line everyone could figure out not long after it started. But even still, it was a good movie, kinda long... not sure I will be willing to revisit it again without wearing Depends. Of course, it would be the ideal movie on a boring rainy day with some wings and beer. Now, that I might do!I gave it a 5 Rating because of the length and the bit under par story line... but even still, it was a good movie."
"The story is too banal and predictable, too much time is spent showing what CGI is capable of with long boring sequences to show how good 3D is, it's a tech demo, knowing there will be 3 more movies it's a given that the situation on pandora in this film it would not have changed much, from the beginning of the film it was immediately understood that one of the sons of the protagonist would have died because it is the only trivial way to arouse some emotion in the viewer, they don't have original ideas, they have exploited the curiosity of a new 3D film and the fame of James Cameron to bring people to the cinema, this second chapter is better than the first only from a technical point of view but the first film at the time was something innovative also from a narrative point of view was original and aroused curiosity, this film should have lasted a maximum of 2 hours in order not to be boring since it is only an introduction to what will happen in the third chapter."
"The whole movie feels like an advert for a CGI company. The characters and writing lack any depth and getting through the almost 3 hour runtime is a bore.Like the first movie, Avatar 2 feels more like a techical showcase than an actual movie. The main characters are bland and lack any persona or motivation for their actions. Over 70% of the film consists of fill or environmental shots that do not develop the story anywhere.Like others have noted, the world-building is good but not enough to make the film worth three hours of sleeping in the cinema. I can only recommend this if you have a good patience and are a big fan of the first movie."
"I expected this movie to be similar to the first: great visuals with a simple story. The story is admittedly fairly simple, and it's definitely similar to the first movie's, but it still manages to never be boring or disappointing. It's a wholesome, compelling, emotional story with great action that is very satisfying. And obviously the amazing visuals are just as good in this one if not better. I legitimately have no criticisms of this movie. There's nothing phenomenally new here, but there's nothing bad about it either. This is easily one of the best movies made in the last decade, especially from Disney, and and this will surely be a classic for decades to come."
"A movie that dumbs down an intelligent species that is supposed to be living in harmony with nature and made to appear like dumb humans. That is in short the story of this movie. The kids in the movie behave like dumb human teenagers with their attitude and crazy behaviour. Are we to believe that a species that calls the mighty Tulkun species it's spirit sisters and brothers is dumb enough to call a species that looks almost similar to them (NAVI) weird looking and freaks? Juts because they have tails that look different? Come on!This movie has dumbness written all over it and they make an enlightened species like the NAVI's and Metkayina appear like the simpsons.I gave this movie 5 because of the effort but that's about it. The whole movie is just a adult cartoon film. Nothing great visually. Expected a lot from James Cameron, looks like he got tired and lost track of what to do with the movie. He ended up making the movie a typical human action flick like transformers.This movie could have been used to invoke the human intelligence about its reality but it just dumbs it down to a level that is disappointing and cliched.Complete waste of time and a big let down."
"The visuals are great. Thats it.There is absolutely no cohesion in the story. First they say the humas need Pandora because Earth is not livable anymore. And then proceeds to being a movie about some magic whale goo worth millions. And after that its just a vendatta from a dead guy.""Bro it's about the way of water"".Character development is non existent in this film. At the end everybody is just the same as in the beginning. Although there were great opportunities to do so.You could say its a copy paste of the first film but then made worse.I'm disappointed and not looking forward to the 3th movie."
"You can make a highly compelling argument to the effect that James Cameron hasn't put a foot wrong since, well, Piranha 2-Flying Killers, and as that was pretty much his first foray, the man has a pretty peerless track record. Until now. Which is not to say that Avatar, Way of Water is a misstep. It's actually a visually ravishing, pretty absorbing 3 and a bit hours journey back into an immaculately realised world he introduced us to in 2009. No, the misstep here is that he's gambled close to 20 years of his life on the assumption that we're as invested in Pandora and the Sully narrative as he is. And I doubt after seeing this, if the lion's share of the public will be as desperate to make the trip back every two years as we were, for instance, to revisit Middle Earth each year over the course of two spectacular fantasy trilogies, or even Hogwarts.It's an enjoyable film, but it left me empty, it left me unfulfilled, uninvested. The excision of the human element, so we now essentially have Navi pitted against Navi, and whilst this allows Cameron to reintroduce old foes, it only serves as to lower the stakes. It reinforced for me the fact that the best adventure stories must be man against beast for us to fully engage, beast against beast doesn't cut it. Alien vs Predator, Kong vs Godzilla anyone? Yeah, who the hell remembers those with any fondness.Anyway, Fox or 20th Century Studios won't be in the least bit worried. They'll recoup the close to 2 billion dollars they've invested in these films several times over, because even this James Cameron is still a horse anyone'd be a halfwit not to back. But this for me, is the first indication that the well is perhaps starting to dry, the sixth sense of picking stories and universes that resonate so compellingly with his public, has begun to desert him. I've never watched a James Cameron film for the first time and forgotten it so damn quickly. I didn't care who lived, I didn't care who died. All I cared for was the visual rapture that was gone the moment I left the cinema. And for me, that just isn't enough. And for a James Cameron movie, that's just about as bad as it gets."
"Could it be worse? Nothing has been added in 10 years as far as the graphics. The plot was stolen for a B western move from the 1930s. The acting is awful. Maybe there's an excuse for such poor acting given the make-up, but its' horrible nonetheless. The so-called high tech is not very advanced for a film that takes place decades in the future. They stuff up a machine gun and think that passes for future weapons. They put a kid in a merry-go-around and think that is futuristic interrogation,. What a joke! OK I walked out after an hours, so maybe something happens in the last 2 hours to make it all worthwhile. Meantime I have a bridge in Brooklyn I can sell to you."
"Solid graphics, story not that creative. The first movie was one of a kind in terms of story telling, creativity, graphics. We've never seen such a masterpiece put together before 2009. Such traits are not present in the sequal. Graphics are much better in the second movie but of course tecnology is getting better with years. Even though the graphics are better than any movie you might watch, the impact of avatar 2 is far from avatar 1. You won't have goosebumps. I find the intro to be weak and really fast. There is no such thing as setting up the grounds as was the case in avatar 1. The ending is not that attractive as well. Overall a good movie but not mind blowing."
"As far as sequels go, this is pretty darn good. It manages to further the lore of the Avatar franchise and setup further movies that, if done correctly, could be quite good. An absolute technical achievement - nothing has looked quite as good or been as immersive as The Way of Water. The story is absolutely derivative in nature, but what story isn't? Looking past this allows the audience to take in the messages of the film, in particular, its environmental call for humanity to reflect on. A story of fathers, sons, and family, it does what Empire Strikes Back did for Star Wars: it builds a future for the franchise."
"Avatar: The way of water looks like a simulation of the real world. It has stunning vfx effects. The vfx effects artists, cinematographers etc has done a great job. Kudos to them.But to look towards the plotline and the story, I think James Cameron has failed to explain the theme of the story in a clear way.Mainly, the story tracks along Jack Sully and his family, running away from the avatar-like clones of the Colonel and his soldiers. Jack Sully along with his family, runs away from the forest and adapts their life into the reefs and with the reef people.So, the story is basically about how Jack, and his family manages to dodge and adapt from the clutches and actions of the clones.Towards the end, when the colonel threatens both the reef people and Jack Sully's family, Jack instead of running away, fights back on the colonel. The theme of the story is to fight back your enemy even if it costs your life instead of scared and running away from him to protect yourself and your family.The theme of the story is great and light. It could be told in the best way possible. And if done, Avatar 2 might've been the best sequel ever been made. But this is where the story lacks.The duration of the movie is 192 minutes, nearly about 3 hours. The movie has great direction, a nice theme, stunning vfx effects, but all for what? About 3 hours sitting on the seats.Why do you expect someone to sit on their seats, in the theater, to watch a movie that is not so active in the plotline. If the story is a major on its plotline, and has some serious ups and downs, from minute to minute, it might be a chance. But such a movie as Avatar, which is emotionally grabbing, which only becomes active on its plotline in the 2nd half of the movie, the movie becomes less interesting and more boring and time-consuming.If James Cameron had found a way to express the theme of the movie in a fast pace, the movie could have been better.Also, the climax, the ship sinking, the final battle, all felt a bit bragged and somewhat unrealistic. To make this movie better, the duration of the climax and the final battle should be minimized."
"The first Avatar movie did not exactly break new grounds when it came to storytelling, so when Avatar 2 is pretty much a rehash of the first movie, something else has to stand out. Like the effects. Well, the effects are very impressive, but so were the effects in the first movie. An evolutionary step up indeed, but nothing truly revolutionary from a viewers point of view. To me, that leaves the characters to captivate the audience, and unfortunately they are as two-dimensional as in the first movie. Often marred by cringe worthy dialogue and klichéd teenage drama not even worthy of a late 1980's sitcom. It is as if Cameron once again caters for the lowest denominator to make sure as many people as possible are lured to the box office. I fully understand that, as a lot of money are at stake, but I miss the Cameron of old, willing to take risks and challenge us as an audience. Oh, but what about the movies messages you ask? As for the movies messages, which are obvious even to a 6-year old, I am sure most will agree on them, and yet, they somehow seem like low hanging fruit, with over the top antagonists lacking any redeeming qualities. With 1980's thematics instead of true eye openers. As a viewer you are left with an empty feeling of deja vu once the end credits start rolling, where you ought to feel rage and a desire to save the world based on a fresh perspective. Yes, we know indiginous people have been treated poorly whenever invasions have occurred throughout the centuries, but that goes for any invaded population throughout history and not just the so called nature people. We also know that whale hunting is bad from the perspective of those who does not base their survival on a species. But it all amounts to nothing new. Given the movies lack of substance, it is at least one hour too long, and I have no urge to revisit Pandora in the coming sequals, as nothing truly exciting seems in store for us. I will watch the sequals, off course I will, but mainly because it seems unlikely that we once again will be served the same dish in a slightly re-arranged manner. Crossing fingers!"
"Definitely worth the wait !3 hours happens without thinking of it, with wonderful visual effects and a beautiful story !We meet new characters, including Jake and Ney'tiri's children, the water people as well as the return of characters from the first opus, giving a real story that makes sense, all these years after the release of the first film.A story centered on the family, and the inhabitants of Pandora facing a human invader full of himself and without consideration for the habitat and the people who surround him!We realize the human stupidity by being from the point of view of the Na'vi, people oppressed by their human invaders who give them no consideration, even if some characters manage to save the day by feeling an ounce of empathy.I absolutely recommend it !"
"Just go see it for yourself. It's worth it just for the visual aspect alone. It's fun. It's not supposed to be the new Godfather or something. It knows what it is. It delivers on what you'd expect.If you just let yourself have fun and not act like a pretentious movie critic, you'll enjoy yourself. It goes by fast.I saw it in Imax. So impressive visually.I was a huge fan of the first one because I've never seen anything like it. This doesn't disappoint. Water is James Cameron's environment. I know it was a total self indulgent film for him. But it really is one of the most impressive things I've seen in a long time."
"Too start off I want to say that this is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. James Cameron manages to completely immerse me in Pandora once again, Brilliant landscapes straight from your dreams, Animals created with immense creativity. While watching you feel as if you can feel it's soul, it pulls you in and stays with you till the very end.The story is a basic one. The big bad enemy want revenge, the protagonist needs to protect his family with all the sacrifice and hardship that comes with it. But while watching this movie you aren't really worrying about it, instead you just end up taking in the culture and intricacies of this strange world.A big plus for me are the hand to hand combat scenes, very well-choreographed and smooth in execution. The actor do a great job of bringing the na'vi to life, with their strange hissing and at times animalistic behavior but by god, the CGI was gorgeous. A million credits to everyone who worked on the movie.This movie is definitely a must watch, if only to awe over the beautifully created world.Rating: 7,5."
"It's an OKAY movie. Great visuals with below average storyline make it an OKAY movie. What I craved most while watching this movie is ""NEWNESS"", which it lacked. Yes, the technology might be the most unique one, but the movie is kind of a repeat of the first one.The same fighting over even a lesser important personal agenda in Pandora doesn't make sense for a sequel. The mechanism of Na'vi tribe is old in the mind of the audience, thus the bonding with spectacular sea animals and the development of it seems another repeated thing. We have been fed a whole lot of under-the-water animal planet scenes, but ironically couldn't see much underwater fighting.The issue is between the 13 years, we have experienced many great epic battles in visually stunning ways such as in ""End Games"", and ""GOT"", the lore of Avatar 2 is just not exciting enough. If we separate the visual factor from the story line, even the most recent ""Wakanda Forever"" had a good deal of visually stunning underwater scenes that makes me ask myself ""What's so unique about this film that we always expect from James Cameron even visually?"""
"The first movie Avatar I saw in 2009, 13 years ago! And I loved it so much so, that I watched it about 20 times since! Then, it was a very long ''waiting period'' and several delays, and I was annoyed and upset of not being able to watch a new movie sooner. And so, a week ago I watched this New movie at last. And in spite of this movie being 3 hours long, I enjoyed it! It is not as good as Avatar 2009, because everything was new there and no one new the plot or characters. Today's movie was more or less predictable, because you could guess of what was going to happen (more or less) in it. Again, very talented screen writers! Stunning visual effects and interesting plot! Thank you J Cameron!"
"So watched this in IMAX 3D today and can honestly say it's the most BEAUTIFUL film I have ever seen. The story is so so but visually this is something else, you can really see that Cameron is a lover of the ocean as the underwater scenes are simply stunning. See it for the visuals if nothing else, but you need to see it on a BIG screen.Overall the story carries on from the original, with a slight twist but moves the story from trees to the ocean. The Sully's now have a family so some time is taken up with getting to know them and how they've come to terms with being the slightly different. Similar story to the original but with enough extras to make it worth viewing, especially for the technological advances in the visual department."
"It's always James Cameron things, the old man is genius the technology especially under water technology he used is incredible...He said that Avatar may be released up to number 6 and 7 and maybe 8, guys after watching this in 6th time i've decided to write a review here..it's true it may be released up to 6 7 or 8 because there are so many stories to tell from Avatar the way of water like different Avatar tribes emergedI've watched this Masterpieces 6 times in theatre i bet this is the best Cinematic movie i've experienced and when you put them 3D glasess on, guys you can see Pandora clearly."
"I really don't know what Cameron was thinking in this one. Yes it's visually spectacular and the 3D version is something else. Go see it for the visuals alone if like good visual.Then we have the problems. Not a single character had any development or depth. There was no back story to any of the characters or events and the movie has little connection to the original (which was also a terrible movie).The whole story arc was poorly written and more in line with something a child would write. Why Cameron decided to put so much effort and money in a story that is so flawed and full of plot holes is beyond me.The movie looks good and is selling. Maybe I'm just more of a book guy after all. I thought it was horrible but can't go lower that 6/10 because of visuals that compare to few or even none.Story wise 1/10, Character wise 1/10, Visually 16/10 which gives this my net score of 6/10. I want to go lower but the visuals are just that good so I wont. Will I see it again? Never. Will it be remembered? No, it will be forgotten and in 20 years people will ask: Was there a second Avatar movie?"
"The lazy writing starts from the beginning - characters that were killed are brought back for no good reason at all. You have the same bad guy who is barely one dimensional - all he wants to do is kill Sully - period. Then you have Sigourney Weaver back for no good reason - even in the narrative explanation, they flat out say there is no explanation for her existence!! There is this human kid, Spider, who serves no plot purpose, and whose parentage is even more perplexing. The movie would have been so much better with fewer children, and brand new antagonists.And then there is the premise of this movie - humans are coming back for vials of whale brain that can keep them immortal?!?! Seriously?!?! This is reason enough to travel across the universe and commit genocide? No explanation on how they figured this out, no idea of how it works or whether there are side effects - it's just magic! And humans will apparently stop at nothing to get this stuff.There was a possible plot point mentioned that could have made this into a great movie: Earth is dying, and people need a new home. But that was just an extra bit of dialogue that someone forgot to leave on the cutting room floor. This point is never mentioned again - after all, who cares when you can stop aging and live forever?Also there is a ton of gratuitous cruelty inflicted by humans. I left the movie feeling disgusted to be a part of this race. It's like being German and having to watch the depraved cruelty Nazis inflicted for hours. Again, it brought nothing more to the plot than to make it clear that humans are absolutely disgusting.And there is the violence against kids. Kids were used, abused, and killed. And again, no good reason except that the bad guy WANTS to kill Sully. Frankly, with all the technology they have, why not just drop an atomic bomb on Sully's home? Oh but that would ruin the plot! (Or improve it)And there were so many scenes that were beyond disbelief. So the main characters are able to ride flying fish as well as the natives in no time. All of a sudden you can talk with whales - have real conversations. They can all hold their breaths for extended periods of time -""just breathe from here"" et voila! You are a fish! You can drown and not die. Bullets are flying but no one gets hurt. Even when a giant whale jumps on a ship and is shot point blank, it basically remains unhurt! Well it was one of the ""good"" guys. It's all too much and makes the action scenes even less interesting.And let's not start with the weird plot turns. Like the humans arrive in a totally violent fashion, but nothing happens for a whole year?!?! It is only a year later that everything starts - which is so dumb and stupid.The only parts of this movie that are great are the visual effects. All the scenes in nature are absolutely fantastic. It is amazing that none of that really exists. It is quite a visual treat - and that alone is worth watching this movie on a huge screen.But for all the money that was spent on the visual effects, you do wish they had spent a little on a worthwhile story. Such a shame!"
"I want to straight forward: I really enjoyed Avatar 2 just for the view. In the start of an Artificial Intelligence, this movie is the perfect illustration.But in terms or story, I'm at bit dissapointed. The revenge story could be more simple actually by doing stealthy undercover job, without too much unnecessary damage. That actually could work. Instead, it is really itchy to the brain seeing corporate work intertwined with personal revenge.What brought to the Pandora for corporate work is profit as efficient as possible, but No! It is revenge! No real corporate does that in reality. Instead you have a group of capable military that their work is hijacking corporate resources with too much unnecessary work. In beginning story of Avatar 2, they're told that they bring more resources that could bring Pandora download but their job first is to kill Jake Sully? Really?Sorry I'm dissapointed with the story."
"Even if you like realistic graphics that James promises to deliver it really doesn't matter two hours into the movie. The problem is he gave us these HD quality visuals and forgot that there is also a story to tell.In one scene Kiri ""opens"" up (generous to say) to Jake about how she feels mentally yet this scene only last 4 seconds and his response is to call her baby girl.We don't feel the family dynamic because of the terrible writing, there is no love just a large budget.The ""bro"" ""cuz"" ""i see you"" repetition just shows even the writers were bored with this.Why is the question you are left with. You wont be mind blown you will be asking yourself why to the so many plot holes."
"Tired old left wing Hollywood making bash America movies. Americans are bad they steal whale oil, kill and hunt animals, steal resources and land, yada yada. It was Pocahontas with blue people. Or Dances with Wolves under the ocean. Nobody mourned the dead American soldiers floating dead in the ship, they were just following orders. Never mind that Jake was a traitor for going over to the other side and fighting against his own people, killing his own people. Never mind that the sophisticated weapons the Navi were using could never have been invented and made by the peaceful but underdeveloped Navi society, but were clearly stolen. Yes, I get that Quaritch was overly vengeful but this movie was so terribly one sided and they made him that way to encourage sympathy with the Navi. England took the land from the Native American Indians. Since America was formed, we haven't taken anyone's land, indeed we have fought and bled to help them keep theirs. Why all the America bashing? What happened in Hollywood in the last 50 years? Nobody can make a pro-American or an original movie?"
"Overcooked movie with amazing Visuals But lacks the basic thing ""The Story"".While working on the animation and graphics the storyline was completely neglected. The same fuss could have been contained within a 90 minutes movie instead of over cooking it for 185 minutes. Fell short of the hype and expectations.There were several loose ends in the story. A lot could have been done to make the movie better. For example Kiri, she had shown special powers but not utilised them to make the movie worth watching.When circled with fire on water they forgot to dive into the water and go below the fire.Overall the movie was not worth spending $5 per ticket."
"I finally got to see the big sequel of the year. It's really everything other moviegoers have already said in their reviews. A film that prioritizes the visual spectacle, sacrificing the quality and depth of the story.Unfortunately, the same premise as the first film is repeated, but in another environment. Even this time it looks a little more simplified, but more branched, in favor of the number of new characters. The Sully kids are very poorly written, because they're kind of silly and irritating. There were at least two love stories that never came to fruition, wasting the adolescent sentimental factor of the plot. Neytiri is left aside, downplaying a character who could have been key. The resurrections and the birth of one of the children are magically imposed without explanation, and they don't finish working even under the logic of the Avatar universe.But let's stop hammering the movie, because there are also good things. Best of all is the atmosphere and the world that Cameron presents to us. Since the first film, the natural CGI world has been spectacular. Definitely the best visual effects of the year. Textures, lighting, contrasts, physical factors, kinetics, anatomy, vehicles, robots. All is of very high quality. Another notable point, and which by now is already a James Cameron hallmark, is the action. There are very good air and sea sequences, both with animals and vehicles.In general terms, despite the story, the film is entertaining, has a high visual impact thanks to its aesthetics and meticulous detail by its director. The best CGI of the year surrounds an overly basic story. Definitely the high rating comes from its technical aspects.Recommended for lovers of fantasy, science fiction and for being part of the filmography of the great James Cameron."
Typical Hollywood Blockbuster Good guys - bad guys movie.Effects are well done. But it feels like a computer game. The effects did not blow me away like when the first movie came out. Nothing really inventive has been done.Boring as hell.Thin dialogues and characters. Predictable.Also... why do they always shoot and destroy? Why not place a nice story into this fantastic world? With no explosions and no American military dialogues?Almost fell asleep and left the cinema after 40 minutes. Never did that before.Could be a fun computer game. But another sad movie in the world of cinema.
"I wanted to love this movie. But it never gave me a reason to care. It's plot, story and reason for existence was very minimal. And there was nothing to gain for the antagonists or protagonists on both sides. Visually it's something to see. But i was expecting more from a project 10-years in the making. We don't get wonderful, scarce tales like Jurassic Park or The Matrix anymore. The standard has lowered because the culture has weakened, and the culture influences top-tier entertainment. And the vitality and boldness of taking a story somewhere interesting has been lost in mainstream cinema. Avatar 2 is a prime example of that. It's not bad, but I've seen better follow-up chapters in straight-to-dvd disney sequels. The tropes were basic, and storytelling was insignificant. And the movie was also. But I do appreciate and gloat in the visual wonder Cameron gives us. It's not not at the level of the first, nor other blockbusters I've seen in 2022. But it has it's enchantment."
"Although I was utterly captivated by the visuals, the more I think about the first movie the more I feel disappointed about this one. Where the first one left me utterly awed this one just made me mad about all the violence, illogical things happening and same overall story as the first one.Why couldn't this have been a positive story without all the extreme violence, war machines, soldiers etc? I almost walked out of the cinema during the scenes where they hunted the ""whale"". I know humans are bad and brutal and whales are still being hunted today, but this doesn't feel like entertainment to me. And you would hope that humans in the future who need a new planet wouldn't start with burning it down, hunting it's wildlife and killing it's inhabitants. I found it quite unbelievable that most humans didn't seem to think one microsecond about what they were doing was bad.Most of the storyline was cheap and transparent. Spirit seems a sort of tarzan, the ""whale"" is Moby Dick. Jake is ultimate good guy (although running around with a gun killing people doesn't seem particularly good), Quaritch is ultimate bad guy, Jake's family are like the Robinson's from Lost in Space. The sea Na'vi were maoris that do a haka.....very original and believable (not). So all in all not very original.And as others have pointed out: where were all the sea Na'vi at the end of the fight? They were nowhere to be seen anymore when the Robinson's were still fighting and trying to survive?I can go on and on about plot holes but my main argument is that I was very disappointed by all the violence and I would love to have seen a more positive and original story.....maybe about the Na'vi and the humans working and living together on Pandora......surely there are writers who have enough imagination to make exploring Pandora (or a new planet) interesting enough!? .....and not simply tell the story of the first movie again with even the exact same lines as in the first one at times!?I sure hope the next movie will not be a ""bad humans fight against the good Na'vi"" again!"
"The only reason this movie is getting a 5/10 is because of the stunning VFX, otherwise it would be a 4/10.First things first. The VFX was gorgeous, congrats to Weta on the crisp, beautiful VFX. There wasn't one shot that the Cg wasn't majestic. The animation and attention to detail in every sequence was perfect. However, I expected more, as it was suppose to be groundbreaking, never seen before CG and it was just pretty much the same as the first Avatar with water. Don't get me wrong, it was perfect but just expected something new.Onto the plot, wow well that plot was awful. I saw on the credits that five people were involved in the writing and I can't help to think that we need better writers. The plot was completely garbage and it was everywhere. I thought the whale/inmortal portion was pretty good but we had ten minutes of that and that's was it. How does a director like Cameron recycles a villain, recycles a bad plot and gives us utterly garbage? Even the first avatar was already a copy paste from Pocahontas and this one is just worse. There was also zero character development, a ton of stupid lines, bad dialogue and an unnecessary cheap death that served no purpose.The music is also a combination of titanic and avatar. It bother me on the first avatar and it bothers me on this one as well. Nothing original about this score, I miss when films had originality. The editing was pretty awful too, at some points the higher frame rate had be a bit dizzy, I hope this isn't the future of filmmaking. The last 20 minutes were also copy paste shots from titanic, I heard a couple people laugh at the ridiculousness from this.I wanted to like this movie but I just didn't, 3 hours is just too long, it's pretty but nothing we haven't seen before, in a way it's just a boring pretty film. The first avatar didn't make an impact on me and this one either, but at least the first one had more action than this one. I won't be back to rewatch and I'm actually bother he keeps re-releasing the first one in order to beat the Marvels he hates so much. If you want to watch a boring film, this one is it but I would just wait till it hits the streaming services.Also, they used the word ""bro"" around 70 times, I wish I was joking."
"One's ability to enjoy this film will be tied to one's expectations of it. The first film was a visual spectacle, with good performances and a simple, and at times silly, screenplay. The trailer for this movie promises more of that and that is exactly what the movie delivers - over 3 hours of excellent visual candy in a bed of Cameron's environmentalist misanthropist propaganda.The story is fairly simple, but its primary function is to bring us into a new pretty environment. As the subtitle of the movie suggests, most of the story plays out in a water world, which brings with it a whole new bunch of things for visual artists to show off.While the story is generally fine, I must mention one thing about the overall theme of the film. In our modern times, there is a tendency in the more politically active circles to berate and thereby alienate members of the public who don't follow the same beliefs. In that light, the anti-human message presented by Avatar to the audience is curious.In the first film, the humans were squarely the bad guys, as they were destroying and killing because of some exotic material they were mining. In the new Avatar, the story makes it clear that humans are fighting for survival. Along with a few other events, this made me increasingly side with the humans, but the film very clearly wants to tell you that white man is evil and slaughters them in large numbers, even when the humans are just going about their business. You know, Mr. Cameron, it is a little strange to expect your audience to see your movie but then also tell them how much they suck. I don't care so much. After all, this is just a silly action-adventure cartoon, but I thought I'd point it out.A few characters who died in the first movie are brought back from the dead through awkwardly shoed in sci-fi magic. I thought the acting in the first film was good, so it makes sense to bring those actors back. I wish there was a less awkward way of doing it.Avatar: The Way of Water is meant to be seen in 3D on a large screen. Unfortunately, this fact greatly diminishes the movie's value once that thing arrives into your living room, unless you have a massive home cinema installation. If you see it properly and you go in expecting nothing more than cool visuals, you won't be disappointed."
"I only made this account to bring light on this massive issue, that has forever ruined this movies series for me. Hopefully some important people in Hollywood will see this and never hire this pathetic human being for any movie ever again.It's 2009, I'm 14 years old and I'm about to experience Avatar in the Cinema for the first time. I went in there and had no idea what to expect.I was blown away. I loved every damn second of it.My perspective of what was possible with CGI changed forever.Now let's fast forward to Wednesday the 14th of November 2022.I'm now a grown man waiting to get the same amazing experience as i had back in 2009.And here comes Lo'ak aka. Britain ""never took and acting class"" Dalton.I have so many questions, but the most important one is:
How could anybody on the set AND EVEN James Cameron not see that his acting is utterly terrible???I would rather watch Nicolas Cage content for 10 hours straight, than have to go through the misery of watching Britain Dalton's performance in Avatar 2 again.And the fact that he ends up saving his dad, who is not even his real dad and haven't had a relationship with throughout his entire life just makes sick to my stomach.I'm now sitting in my couch miserable, devastated, burned in and just an absolute mess because this guy ruined this movies experience for me.But great job with the CGI, James."
"This is the pop corn movie, and this is nothing special except perfect computer effects, but avatar have deep massage for battle against globalization and robbery from us , and because of that I give him 7 . I love avatar like movie from future and warning what's happening on the world. Nature and earth need more attention from us ! Movie like avatar not simple fantasy movie. This is the movie for battle against dark side of humanity. Maybe avatar we can understand like religious movie , and battle with good and evil. Everyone can watch and think about movie like dark and light side of life. Real opinion movie not bad ."
"Just returned from a session. The very first thing I want to say is that the plot would not be so bad if it had not been given so much time. So hackneyed and not leading to anything, the plot should not go 3 hours!There are only two pluses: graphics and acting.50% of the plot is a self-repetition of the first part, only now not the protagonist, but the antagonist adapts to the Navi world. And this is the best part of the story (despite all the cons).And if the return of the colonel was explained quite clearly, then the appearance of his son is mega-meaningless. Is it really true that no one checks employees and soldiers for pregnancy at the human base? (given that children cannot be returned to Earth). Why didn't the unknown mother of the child have an abortion? I doubt it's a Catholic firm. If they had a goal to populate Pandora with people, then there would be more children.The second 50% of the plot is a teenage movie about Jake's children, who must adapt to a new society. They have beaten and flared personalities and conflicts with messengers that we have seen in a thousand high school movies (only here they are Navi, not people).Then I didn't like how they changed Grace's death. It turns out that after they gave her body to Eyva in a touching scene, they then took her out of there and checked for pregnancy and managed to place her in a cryochamber before the body died."
"This movie was amazing to say the least. As someone who falls asleep at the theater quite regularly (Cats on Broadway, and even the new Top Gun), this kept me entertained the whole time. I didn't feel the 3 hours at all. As a mom who is sick and tired of trying to find a movie that doesn't throw in tons of expletives (there are a few that are appropriately placed) and riddle the storyline with sexual references, my entire family from 10 years to 56 years absolutely loved this. We also are huge fans of the Disney ride and enjoyed seeing where the footage for the ride came from!I'm not sure what people are talking about with the storyline. To complain about it drawing on other sequels by have the kids involved was obviously written by someone who probably lives alone or in their mother's basement surrounded by their comic books and He-Man dolls. It is logical that two beings who fall in love and get married to start a family. I am so excited about the set up for Avatar 3. Job very well done James Cameron!"
"Two stars only because producers spent a budget equivalent to GDP of a small country on the visuals. Zero plot, no character development, no emotions, killer of a length, money wasted. Also, it's so conventional and conservative aka no deviation from traditional values, and even those and butchered by Jake and his partner. Thought that we were done with white male saviour image but alas James Cameron definitely loves this one. Re visuals - yes, quite impressive but hurts your eyes during fast action scenes. Do not recommend, spend your time and money watching Moana and Titanic, much better value."
"Have you seen the first movie thirteen years ago? Or you just born yesterday and see this movie and says ""Wow its amazing movie nice graphic or CGI"" if say so you just got here and not understand lived in the past.I watched the first movie around 2009 and its amazing I would gave 9.5 ratings. Almost beat ""The Amazing Spiderman"" movies in 2002, and almost equals to ""Ironman"" in 2008. On the Avatar: The Way of Water this movie the CGI was exaggerated it's like not to be outdone with other movies such as Avengers and other movies with mediocre CGI effects but has good story lines. This movies just for children's not for me, I rather watch National Geographic and they should make this prequel not just a sequel and wasting 3hour to watch.The 3D version just not worthed there are lot of movies out there that the same or more than this movies, add more fps and color but not have a good story line."
The story is amazing people will say it is dull but you need to listen and understand why the characters are doing what there doing. James Cameron made multiple amazing story parts for each character. The humans are predicted perfectly of how the human race treats nature as if it's there own and uses it for money. They bring back cool characters and the movie finds out how to pull on you heart strings and makes you feel good and sad vibes. Some people would say it's a bad film but it's just truly a masterpiece of a film it has great VFX great story telling and great settings. The wild life acts so much as its own characters. Just a perfect film.
This is a spoiler review. The movie visuals were amazing as I saw it in IMAX 3D and it was definitely worth watching it in that. I did like also the new characters and the returning characters too. I hated the story line of Spider the human that was raised by the avatars and thats because I thought he was just annoying and was changing sides constantly and you never new who side he was going to choose and he was just not my favourite in the movie. I do though think spider will be the villain in maybe future avatar movies as he saved his technically father Quartich at the end of the movie and maybe he will join the humans and also Neytiri does not seem at all that she likes spider at all as she did cut him with a knife and does seem like there is confclict there. The future of avatar movies look great though as by the end of the movie it seems like they will take the fight to the humans and I think that will lead to all out war which I love. So we will definitely see where that goes and I will look forward to that and future movies and more stories and I will definitely maybe see it in theatres again would recommend but could be better.
Avatar unlike other movies which uses traditional 24 uses 44 or 40 fps instead i don't have any problem using new technology but i felt the whole movie went too fast like 1.10X speed playback sometimes it's hard to embrace and feel a satisfaction when the movie constantly dumps you more and more aesthetically beautiful surroundings and scenes in 3d but its hard to grasp what is happening and just move with movie flow.The villain of the movie compared to part 1 was not ruthless and there was no aura of any evil in him no matter how they tried still looked bland he was more into kidnapping and revenge and that too was not enough to make the villain look like a villain .I think this whole movie focused on navi Bond with sea creatures and how humans destroy our planet and prey on pandora beings hunting them mere for oil and medicines not knowing the effect etc which they did a good job but other than that whole jake sully trip was like a videogame cutscene.
"Apparently $350m buys you a poor story, cardboard antagonists, super dumb protagonists, and a good/average 2022 effects. Rarely entertaining, never challenging, and wildly predictable, I can't imagine recommending anyone put their three hours into this.Seriously, how many times do we need to see the exact same bad choices happen, with the exact same results? Sixty-ninety minutes of this should have been left on the editing floor. I don't know what happened to James Cameron in the late 90s, but he hasn't been up to his standards since True Lies.Full disclosure, I thought pretty much the same thing about the first (except the effects were ahead of the curve, at the time)."
"I'll make this review quick and to the point.--- Avatar 2 is one of the most beautiful films I've ever experience on the big screen and of course in 3D. It's a grand work of Art. The second half, or the battle scene around the whale in the last act is one of the most incredible things I've ever seen in film.--- it's long. But take a break every so often. Get up for 2 or 3 minutes, get a soda, walk around and come back. The 3D will actually pop out more again after your eyes get a tiny rest.--- I'll rarely say this, but Avatar 2 is a movie that you need to come back and watch a second time in theaters before it leaves.I'm looking forward to some more new biomes and tech that James Cameron is going to take us to next. Avatar 5 should have a Virtual Reality version where I can turn my head and see around the scene for some scenes!"
"One of the most anticipated movies ever finally arrived in cinemas, but it was worth the wait! Avatar (2009) was the highest-grossing movie of all time, and the sequel was supposed to be released in December 2015, alongside Star Wars: The Force Awakens. It has been postponed many times since then. Those are the two main reasons Avatar: The Way of Water was such a highly anticipated movie. The third reason is that it's a new James Cameron movie. Think about how awesome that is. This is only his second movie in the 21st century, so it's a must-see.Many years have passed since the first movie, so Avatar: The Way of Water opens with a brief exposition to bridge these two movies. I don't usually appreciate it when a movie starts like that, considering it is poor storytelling, but it was a much-needed exposition. From the opening shot, we see Floating Mountains that are captivating as always, and immediately you are transported to the magical world of Pandora. Frankly, I wouldn't mind listening to a weather report while these immersive shots emerge on the screen, let alone exposition.After the exposition, we see military people arriving on Pandora, and that scene has a powerful message. When human spaceships land on Pandora, as a result, they burn an enormous part of the forest with the spaceship engines and wreak havoc on wildlife. Obviously, they don't even care about it at all. They were only looking for a convenient place to land without even thinking about the environmental consequences. This scene says a lot about human nature. Wherever they go, they bring destruction with them.The good thing about a sequel is that we don't spend time with humans like in the previous movie except for a new character called Spider and just a few others. An even better than that is the fact that Sam Worthington only stars like a motion capture character. He doesn't portray his human character anymore. I consider his acting as a critical flaw in the first Avatar movie.From the start, we follow Jake and his family members. Throughout the film, we can see his struggle as a parent and his attempts to protect them from danger. There is also a struggle among his kids. They want to be seen as adults, hunt with their tribe, and fight by their side. As time passes by, Jake becomes overprotective, although it backfires on him. His kids want more independence, which leads to more disobedience, in an attempt to prove themselves as brave warriors. This story is a recycling of many movies in the past, so that part became too familiar and tedious.Numerous characters died at the end of the last movie, so we have the opportunity to meet plenty of new ones. As for the Spider, a new human character, we only learn that he is wild and unpredictable, especially towards the end of the movie when he makes some very unnecessary decisions.As we saw in the trailer, Jake has four children now, but Cameron doesn't dedicate screentime to all equally. We spend most of the time with his oldest daughter Kiri and his youngest son Lo'ak who somehow oddly resembles a lot like Robert Pattinson. Of course, it's not him, but once you realize it, you can't help but look at him that way. The audience will probably like these two the most. I think Kiri has the most compelling character arc development. She is a young shy Na'vi girl who has difficulties fitting in with a new tribe. She is different and sees it as a negative because the other kids see her as a freak. Countless teens can relate to her character as they try to find their place in this big modern world.The thing that bothered me the most was the villain of the movie. We already knew it would be the same antagonist as the last time. Quaritch is coming back, and I think it is a wrong decision. There is no good reason why he is returning after he died in the first movie. Even worse is that the final battle in Avatar (2009) loses its significance now. The only reason I can find for the revival of the Quaritch ties to the main plot.In fact, the plot is simple. Humans want revenge for being banished from Pandora at the end of the last movie. They come again, and they fight with Jake. That's it, the whole story. The fact is that there is no good reason for the continuation of the story. Villian lacks motivation, and the entire movie wouldn't exist if the ""Sky People"" haven't returned to Pandora to seek revenge. But there are some advantages and disadvantages when a movie has a thin plot.Cameron dedicated time to enriching his characters, and I liked how he developed them throughout the film. Certain characters need to make tough decisions towards the end, so we learn a lot about the other side of them that we didn't know existed. Look at it this way, movies like Raid (2011) or Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) have simple plots, yet they were one of the best action movies in recent memories. Those movies know what they are and what they are trying to accomplish. So not every movie needs to have complex storytelling in order to be great.Hayao Miyazaki, the greatest Japanese animation director, once explained a term called ""Ma"" which we can translate as emptiness. Miyazaki said, when you clap a few times with your hands, that's just unnecessary noise. Miyazaki further explains: ""The time in between my clapping is Ma. If you have just non-stop action with no breathing space at all, it's just busyness. But if you take a moment, then the tension building in the film can grow into a wider dimension. What really matters is the underlying emotions...""This is exactly what James Cameron tries to do in the second act of Avatar: The Way of Water. It takes time away from the action to explore the majestic underwater world. Nothing crucial happens to the plot in this part of the movie, yet we see a series of the most magnificent shots in cinema history. During this sequence, at least four people left the movie theater and didn't return. It is evident that the audience only seems to care about action in a movie nowadays and nothing else.The funny thing is when Lo'ak is swimming with a whale, it was actually my favorite scene in the entire film, and that tells a lot, considering it lasts for 3 hours. We need more scenes like these cause while I was watching Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, I got overwhelmed with action sequences, hence I got bored. It had the opposite effect on me, and I don't believe I am the only one who feels this way.There are also an abundance of awe-inspiring action sequences in the first and especially the third act of the film. Despite that, I felt partly disappointed with the final battle as it lacked scope and grandeur compared to the first Avatar movie. It's done on a smaller scale however it is intended in that way to become more personal for the characters, which is not necessarily a bad thing. I didn't expect it, although I believe I will appreciate it more on consecutive viewings.Avatar: The Way of Water is an excellent movie, but I don't think it will be as impactful as the previous one. When the first movie came out, it was leagues above every other sci-fi/fantasy movie in terms of CGI. It was a massive leap forward regarding special effects and motion capture improvements. I respect James Cameron, as he chose to film numerous close-up shots with actors wearing motion capture suits and bravely demonstrate what he was doing in the last five years with his talented VFX team. He doesn't shy away from it as we see in other movies, trying to cover up special effects with overly dark scenes and hoping audiences won't notice how terrible CGI actually is.Visually it's an astonishing achievement. But a problem I have is that Cameron overuses blue color combined with purple, which means the movie has a limited color palette. I think I saw all shades of blue in this movie, but it reminds me a lot of a first movie, and it is hard to distinguish visually one film from the other. When they go underwater, it is appropriate for the screen to explode with blue color, but he uses this color literally in every scene.I adore the decision to shoot this movie at a higher frame rate because you can see movement more clearly. Many people don't like it, since they are used to movies filmed in 24 frames per second. We only need time for our eyes to get accustomed to 48 fps. If we get more movies with higher frame rates, we won't notice anything strange with quick movements, as we sometimes do now.Another essential technical improvement, compared to other movies, is the stunning utilization of 3D. I can't remember the last time I said that about a movie. Honestly, I've avoided watching films in 3D for years, but Cameron really knows what he is doing when he shoots in 3D. One of the few directors who can seamlessly incorporate 3D technology in the right way, so I definitely recommend watching it in 3D and, of course, in an IMAX theater to experience it in the best possible way.What I value the most in the film is the message that shows us that we should protect and preserve the marine world and, in general, the entire nature on our planet. Even in the last film, he left a strong message about the importance of preserving the rainforests. I respect that he tries to leave a clear message to the younger generations of how important it is not only for our future but also for the future of our planet.Avatar: The Way of Water is an immersive experience, so I didn't mind a 3-hour runtime. Unfortunately, the majority of the audience today can't hold their attention for that long, but that shouldn't prevent directors from having shorter runtimes. As James Cameron said recently in an interview: ""They can see the scene they missed when they come to see it again."""
"For very few movies, the sequel is as good as or better than the first one. I think this movie is one of those.13 years have passed since Avatar (2009) and the main protagonist - Jake Sully - is now the head of Pandora forest tribe (Omaticaya). He has formed a family by now bearing children with his beautiful wife Neytiri. They have been living peacefully in the forest all these years but it does not last long.Will Jake and his family survive the catastrophe? Is there a new strategy this time? Where will they go? Who will they meet?This movie is like watching a beautiful painting on the big screen. Not just VFX (which are incredibly beautiful) but the overall impact in storytelling including the music is just amazing.This is easily a 'movie of the year'.Must watch in IMAX 3D."
"Of course nice visuals but beyond that fully predictable. All elements of plot are unsurprising to moviegoer. No reason to make it 3 hours for that exact reason.Other pros:
-film score blends well
-don't need to remember anything about first movie to watchCons:
-action for action's sake
-long
-wish there was more commentary or suggestion of openness to others joining a new tribe. When in film will we see the tribe that is open to immigrants/otherness from the getgo?-this movie is pro-mother but not necessarily pro-woman. Man is king and so is heteronormativity. I hope this type of story in film can evolve one day."
"Visuals aren't enough to keep me interested. That's why I left at the hour mark. I was ready to leave 15 minutes do to the laughable acting and stupid spider character, but I waited in hope I was wrong.I wasn't.After the first movie, the ""sky people"" (laughable name) leave the planet but the good guy scientists stay behind with little toddler spider (he can't go in a stasis/cryo tube). So now everyone is happy and Jake has a family.The ""sky people"" return (devastating the forest) and the Navi begin fighting back. But hey, let's download the consciousness of the badgiy from the original into an avatar so he can start to hunt Jake and Co.Spider gets caught and Jake moves his family to the water tribe where they have to learn new Navi ways.Blah blah blah, I'm out.I started laughing the moment Jake's wife got all teary and cried when the forest was damaged. I groaned at the hoora semper fi B. S. warrior plot. The acting was bland, the story was tripe, and I walked out before my laughter would ruin the movie for the 12 other viewers.CGI is a crutch used by filmmakers to pass lame stories off as epics. This movie is forgettable, overlong, and poorly written. If you like it, that's fine, but this is not a masterpiece. It's a beautiful c grade script that I regret giving money too. I hear the third act is pretty cool, but if you gotta sit through two hours of corny environmentalist writing, I say skip the theater and wait for clips on youtube.Saw a few clips and laughed at how bad the acting was. This movie is not good. People are just wowed by CGI."
"As Expected once again James Cameron and his team delivered a eye pleasing visual experience . Avatar 2 follows same kinda formula in storytelling as Avatar 1 . Decent storyline and screenplay had its ups and downs , writers did a decent job . There were some intresting new characters . Exploring Metkayina Clan and water way of Pandora was intresting .Technically , this time they increased frame rates which delivers smoother transitions and immersive 3D effects , it was something new experience .Runtime was around 3hrs 12mins long , in-between there some potential boring sequence but somehow visuals holded me from getting into bored . Overall ""a TECHNICAL MASTERPIECE"" . Don't miss out to experience it on big screen . Really looking forward to watch it on IMAX 3D for second count ."
"Avatar 1 (2009): Jake, the protagonist, faces human Quartich, the antagonist (villain) in the final battle, and Quartich is killed. Meanwhile, Neytari undergoes psychological trauma by experiencing her planet being ravaged and torched by the invaders, all the while grieving for her murdered father.Avatar 2 (2022): Jake, the protagonist, faces Avatar Quartich, the antagonist (villain) in the final battle, yet Avatar Quartich survives (so that he can dreadfully reappear in Avatar 3). Meanwhile, yet-again, Neytari undergoes psychological trauma by experiencing her planet being ravaged and torched by the invaders at the beginning of the film, all the while grieving for her murdered son. At this point, her crying and screaming is beyond tolerable for another dreadful installment in this saga.Now package a seemingly recycled plot with very expensive pretty CGI VFX with video game camera angles and higher resolution blue meerkats, and a James Cameron view of looking at the universe, and you have a vapid and mundane restrictive view of storytelling. When the previous film made close to $3 billion in the box-office, pray-tell, why would the writers and producers wish to change the profit-formula for the next film? Albeit, this CGI fantasy storytelling is popular among the masses, it does not contribute to the already oversaturated film selection that already has explored this theme time and time again. This film is literally a new interpretation and presentation of the first film, without the charm and authenticity of a stellar plot. Among the infinite avenues that could have been chosen to explore the world of Pandora, Cameron and company chose to restrict their universe and characters with an algorithm designed to pays the bills and remain predictable. As such, this film was an entire let-down, and I will not be wasting my time with parts 3, 4, 5, 6, and possibly 7."
"A disappointing display of CGI...Refueled with old Avatar, some Save Willy and some Moby Dick. What was nice is that Cameron can not forget his beloved love for water and sea so U got plenty of these. The screenplay is, in my view, very soft, to put it mildly, so U don't have to sit on a theater chair for as long as three hours. U can do your Mall things and return from time to time to the screen. All in all it reminded me of that old Windows screen savers with fishes in aquarium. What a blast! If U are in how Pandora is expanding this is the movie for you, but if you are looking for an Avatar sequel maybe you should wait for the third part. Who knows? It will bring fire or dust..."
"Although it has been a while after first film was released , Avatar: the way of water attracts me in many ways. First of all scenario and character are well written compared with first one. Character development is good but some gaps and cliches in scenario still remain. James Cameron wanted to show us Pandora and he did it very well. Explore Pandora is amazing experience with special effects. Above everything , visual feast is represented in unbelievable way. Nothing can be compared with Avatar: the way of water for that. Although film runs 3 hours and story is repeated at some points , you never get bored because of this magical visual feast. Watching on Imax or 4dx is highly recommended because it takes you directly to Pandora. I really enjoy with new characters and they change dynamics of film. It is more emotional rather than first film too. Demonstrate family, new nation is also succesful. I catched some references to Titanic as well. Looks like James Cameron filmed Titanic again in another universe. This makes me feel very good. Cast is always incredibly talented but we all should appreciate Zoe Saldana who did a great job in second movie. Her character is so powerful and her impressive performance is fabuluous. Personally I think that ending is not so satisfying. I think we should need new villain instead of keep going with same character which we know he is not going to die. But in general after a few years cinema starts to thrive again and that is really good."
"Okay. I looked at the wiki pages for this movie and Babylon. Babylon's not doing anything in the box office practically, within the same stretch of days between the middle of December and the middle of January. The excuses they made for babylon's poor performance at the box office, is a triple pandemic, and ardent fear of it. And the wiki entry for this movie Avatar The Way of the water, they say it made an impossible amount over a billion dollars in the same stretch of days. What happened to that fear of the triple pandemic? What the wiki says is that it did a great performance in a pandemic year. Either you are scared of the pandemic, or you are not. Which is it? Plus this movie is being touted as made a science fiction amount of money in the same stretch, while Babylon made practically nothing in the same 30 days. This comparison reminds me, the way they trivialize the pandemic, of a Saturday night live sketch. It's the greatest sketch of all time, on a show that now primarily sucks. It was many years ago. They simply had a screen, your TV screen, showing an orange on a revolving surface. More like the surface that you would have in your microwave, except smaller, and flat enough to comfortably sit the orange. That orange was being rotated slowly, like some diamond encrusted showpiece, being rotated so you can get a view from every angle as you sit in front of your TV screen. After a few moments of you just sitting there watching an orange rotate, on the motorized platform, you see the screen fade to Black, then the screen fades back in and you see the orange again, as a whole bunch of people come chasing after the orange mob style, to get its autograph, which today would be a selfie, with you and the orange in the same frame. Yes I am talking about the fruit. You know the message. If it's on TV, you will believe it, no matter what they say do or think. The purveyors of the television media, the press media, print media, mainstream, that own online articles and such, are what you will bow to, blindly, no matter what. The fact that they were willing to put that skit on screen proves that the author of Saturday night live and all those who run mainstream media, are aware of the power they have, and they think you are stupid. And indeed, when some of us are told we are slaves to the media, we get indignant and defensive. Of course that feeds into their hand. Both of these movies are being nominated for awards, and probably have already won some by this writing. And you will believe it's all legitimate. Having said that, I tried to watch both of these movies, and I got the feeling, completely disjointed motion picture, and I have yet to to complete the viewing of either. A movie should not be a labor to get through. Why is it that the ones that are labor to get through, always get the awards and their critical praise? I randomly gave it five stars just to get attention. The reality is this movie is really really low grade. But money matters. They spent over the usual Budget on Avatar, so they are determined to make you think it profited. Big time in an impossible fashion. They spent very little money comparatively speaking, on Babylon. But they still spent some money, so they are making excuses for the movie. Either way they know better what you're doing than you know yourself. Apparently. I suspect this movie review would get banned because I'm not on topic. I am on topic because the other movie and media presentation were necessary for the comparison. And so was everything that I used. But honesty it's a very lonely word, and usually gets your review banned or deleted. I just wanted to say I did not use any foul language. I did not touch upon any singular person. I spoke of the general consensus, probably something everyone already knows. But we will see."
"Omg, same pattern as the first movie, full of stereotypes, humans are all bad guys and bring destruction wherever they go and there is no different because different are special people. Nice special effects - for heaven's sake - but it's exactly like the first film, only in the sea. The blood of demons and half-bloods, the racism of the different, the younger and imperfect and rebellious brother but capable of ""seeing beyond the schemes"" and in short, always the same story already seen and reviewed a thousand other times. Avatar 2 is a heated soup full of stereotypes, frankly I expected much more after all this waiting..."
"If you like a movie in which a psychopath with an army chases down a defenceless family of mostly kids then this is the film for you. There's nothing more to it than that, really, no subtlety, no nuance, just a giant sledgehammer of a plot surrounded by pretty looking scenery.At one point in the middle I wanted to get up and leave, and if I had been on my own, I would have gone.I am sick to death of movies that revolve around long drawn out fighting scenes and gratuitous violence, it's not that I'm a pacifist, but they are just so boring. Seen one fight, you've seen them all, really. Seen hundreds of them, you just think for crying out loud, Hollywood, give us something else for once. TWOW could have been so much better if they had bothered with some kind of plot.I am unlikely to bother with the inevitable sequel. That's three hours of my life I won't get back."
"""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is visually the best thing I have ever seen, and it's not even close. This visual aspect is not something merely technical, but it's integral for the experience. The feel of immersion, as well as the magnificent direction from James Cameron, is what conveys emotions and stakes to the movie. The plot is simple, it has some defects more than the first one, but I found myself immersed in it and very engaged. I totally forgot that I was in the theatre and this helped me a lot to experience a wide range of emotions from fear to excitement, from sadness to wonder. So the movie was a blast for me.However ""The Way of Water"" is not perfect, and in general I preferred the first Avatar. This is because especially in the final act there are few issues in terms of plot and stakes. I won't say precisely those problems not to spoil anything, but as far as stakes it is probably an issue of having to deal with other three sequels. This is the main reason why I think the first one is a better movie. Indeed it was intended to be very close, eventually a single movie and all the plot lines were closed and contained in the movie. Avatar 2 has a satisfactory conclusion, but there are few arcs that are still totally open and we'll need more movies to see them closed. Furthermore the final battle is much smaller in scope than the one in the first movie. It's great, fun and enjoyable but clearly a mega battle couldn't have been done here because then what would you do in the third one? Or in the fourth? Some progression in scope is needed, and I felt the limitation in ""The Way of Water"".In conclusion ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is a fantastic cinematic experience that you should do. Do yourself a favor and watch it in the best theatre you know, possibly in 3D because is majestic. There are some problems in the plot, but they don't ruin the overall experience and they show the saga nature of this production. And as far as that I can't wait to see how this generational saga that James Cameron is trying to create will continue. I am totally on board!"
"This movie had more potential than it was allowed. Cameron seems to have made a hyper focus on family and the immutable characteristics between Father and Son, Mother and Daughter. So much so that we see lines and scenes somehow make their way from the first movie into the second were it really shouldn't have been. It also tries very hard to show the savagery and raw nature that tribalism brings to the table. All in all it leave the table open and wanting. Hopefully the next movie will better and more polished. This movie could be the same with maybe 10-20 minutes of less footage. It's like Cameron really wanted us to see what his team made in Unreal Engine."
"This time, I made an exception by havin an expectation bout this movie. Ofc, its coz this is directed by one of the greatest directors in Hollywood, James Cameron. Luckily, this movie reaches my expectation.This movie is a sequel to the previous movie with a plot in Pandora Planet, full of alien races named Avatar. After the failure of the human race to take over the planet, some of them seek revenge for a rebellious human officer, Jake Sully who is actually siding with them rather than the human race. Then, this movie is about Jake Sully's famz survival from human revenge.What I love about this movie are the visuals, audio, and magical world. Ofc, it happens because the previous movie also gives these to the audiences. So, it reaches the audience's expectations including mine. But, the best thing is visual. Feels very magical and mesmerizing. From the beginning, the movie also gives a blueish world all the time. To make it better, it gives us fictional ethnic culture including voices that are kinda like an animal wants to bite, lol. Besides that, the best plot happens when the ending is narrated through 3 different plots which each different struggles. I didn't expect this and might be similar to the Titanic movie coz happened in the water too.Sadly, this movie is too long. More than 3 hrs? Why? I keep wondering about this movie's duration. I didn't think it deserve that long. Perhaps, 2-2.5 hrs still plausible. I drank coffee before watching but sadly I feel so sleepy when starting around 2 hrs, lol. Besides that, this movie so year-end vibes because bring family issues and their importance of them. Tbh, I get bored with this but no offense, it's purely subjective opinion.The bottom line, this movie perfectly has amazing visuals! The ending was also great! The best starter pack are coffee, chips or snack or popcorn, Dolby atmos studio, and maybe IMAX? Perfectly fulfilled our year-end vibes, but sometimes is boring, lol. Great movie to watch! This is a James Cameron artwork! He was the director of Titanic in case u don't know him, shame on you if u really don't know HAHA.7/10."
"When Avatar (2009) came out, I had a choice at the cinema that day. The choice was, to watch Avatar or The Book of Eli. I asked the cinema person what I should see on arrival and they literally printed off a ticket for Avatar without saying much else. I saw it in 3D and I remember walking out of the cinema, calling my wife (I was working away from home), and said to her ""You NEED to see this movie"".I came home, I immediately took her to see the movie and she loved it. We have watched it so many times since.Fast forward 13 years later for the sequel. I was excited, and I went myself again as my wife was watching our baby. I anticipated coming out the cinema and phoning / texting my wife saying ""You NEED to see this"", but I didn't.The sequel is too long, and it has been said that James Cameron even cut out scenes because there were too many gun scenes. Had he left them in, how long would it have been?There was no story to this movie, unlike the first movie. It was ""Let's go to this planet and kill Jake Sully"" was the theme. The storyline was not interesting, I was clock watching all the way through it. It dragged on in places and could have easily been edited out.The visual effects were amazing, and the graphics were outstanding. The movie (story) itself? Well, I won't be rushing back with my wife to watch it, sadly."
"It checks all the boxes, while offering something new in the same breath. The cgi is gorgeous, especially the underwater scenes. While the story itself is rather simple, and the theme's ultimately boil down to ""family,"" that's honestly all it needed. Im simply stunned James was able to pull this off after 10 years. Now this isn't to say the movie is without flaws. It's a little long, and I personally think shaving 15 minutes off the runtime could've really streamlined it. If you're looking for deep introspective writing and complicated themes, perhaps this film isn't for you. But if you're like me, and are just happy to visit pandora again, this movie will please you greatly."
"It's a good movie to enjoy in the theater as the effects are captivating. However, apart from the visual effects, in my opinion, you don't have anything else to get hooked on, since although the story tries to show the continuation of the life of the main characters, they lose prominence in front of the visual shots, and in fact, the story itself ceases to be the protagonist, to give prominence to the visual spectacle.Avatar 2 is much more visual and fanciful in terms of special effects, and for that it would be worth watching.But Avatar 1 had a balance between special effects and development of the story and plot in general, which made it even interesting to watch it multiple times, as there were several elements to analyze. In Avatar 2, you wouldn't have much to enjoy except the special effects, as even the music wasn't that great."
"A movie that disappointed me so much, it made me write a review.After the end of Avatar one would have thought that the ex-marine would integrate into the native culture. Nope. Instead, everything is totally US-military. Men armed with machine guns, walkie-talkie men, in clear hierarchies (the strong ones are at the top) and this american address in the family with ""sir"" and this eternal drivel of ""I have to protect my family"" are just as annoying as the rouge cop archetype who is embodied by the son (this stupid boy who never does what he is told and is constantly rewarded for it - the exemplary intelligent ivy leauge son man dies of course). Women in this film are only hysterical and conspicuously emotional. The only glimmer of hope is the youngest daughter, who brings humor to the film in two passages - those are the only passages. The rest is characterized by a male military atmosphere with lots of action. A film for a very young audience with clear good and bad and Christian family fuss (of course the bad father has to survive in the end), which doesn't even come close to the complexity of the predecessor and therefore probably fits better into our time.Before fleeing, how does the family know that the mission of the ultra stereotypically evil people is to kill him? Apparently it's all about killing Sully, although he has already withdrawn and thus left his entire people and the forest in the lurch and the people can now get the raw materials. The film lacks complexity - there are only the military and the natives. Scientists, economics no longer play a role. Everything is clearly ordered into good and bad.What happens in the big end fight? Why is everyone suddenly gone except for the family and the last evil final boss?"
"1st: let's start with the obvious high, the CGI is the best ever seen on screen, so no arguing about that, but thereafter it gets harder to keep singing it's praises..... that was it for me, and the bulk of the 7 star rating!2nd: the plot is well thin to put it mildly and bears so much similarity to a 'cowboys vs Indians' metaphor it's hard to imagine the script writer(s) were supposedly being paid to be original! It even goes down to minutiae in detail, like clothing, housing, culture, food, even language..... I began to wonder if I'd come to a different movie!3rd: it's far too long, so long it started to become boring!4th: aside from the obvious plot setting this hasn't really got much to do with sci-fi, change the plot setting to say colonial Africa or the American west and you could tell exactly the same story!5th: there can't possibly be a sequel (hopefully), although I'm sure this will already be in the pipeline courtesy of the huge box office receipts already reported!Was an interesting movie concept, but that's enough please!"
"James Cameron is already the father of the ""Terminator"" saga (1984-1991), which teaches us that ""if a machine, a Terminator, can learn the value of human life, maybe we can too.""He is also the author of a masterful sequel to Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" (1979) - ""Aliens"" (1986) - and another aquatic peace work ""Abyss"" (1989).With ""Avatar"" (2009), what had begun as yet another cinematic phenomenon after ""Titanic"" (1997), which definitively consecrated him as the king of the world box office, turned into an epic sci-fi fresco, thanks to his imagination and prolific writing that are fertile to the point of giving birth to another five to seven episodes overall.The aquatic world of Pandora is breathtakingly beautiful. It is the fruit of all the know-how of James Cameron and his teams, who have used the most traditional methods as well as the invention of new technologies in order to achieve this tour de force, which can only be rewarded with an Oscar.""Avatar"" is the greatest environmentalist and humanist saga in the history of cinema, with intelligent and sensitive blockbusters that today's world really needs, because they teach Respect for Self, Others and our Environment - on Pandora as on Earth!The treatment of the Na'vis by resource-hungry, belligerent, slave-owning, and genocidal settlers is the same as that suffered by the victims of imperialism from the 15th century to modern imperial wars.If humanity struggles to learn, as a whole, it is because there is still too many Miles Quaritch and not enough Jake Sully.May the cinematic universe of Avatar therefore contribute to changing mentalities and to making the future rhyme with evolution and multiethnic and multicultural respect on Earth and beyond."
"My experience was slightly altered because of the sad fact that my 3D clip-on glasses broke at the beginning of the movie but I do not blame the movie for that obviously. Traffic also caused me to be a tad bit late so there's that as well. Despite all of these very annoying circumstances, I think I enjoyed the movie more than I expected to. Though personally it felt like more of the same.I fear that if the movie were seen in regular 2D, the ""rollercoaster experience"" that people talk of would completely disappear, and that's unfortunate. I watched the movie in 4DX 3D HFR, which was quite crazy. I felt like I was quite literally falling out of my chair a few times. It was funny but I definitely prefer just regular viewing. I'll definitely be going back to view this one in IMAX 3D to be in the right mindset (and also for the ""Oppenheimer"" trailer lol.)The visuals were great, though. You can tell that people really put effort into the creation of this large world full of different species and vegetation. It was definitely and upgrade from it's predecessor, as well as from most CGI-heavy movies being released during this day and age. I can't wait to see more behind the scenes footage of how they made this film.The way the story went felt similar to me like how ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" brought back that saga into our world. The concept being the same with enhanced visuals and 'better' action sequences. The one thing I did really enjoy was the way Quaritch's story was told and the depth they gave his character - which he was missing in the first one.Despite the movie being over 3 hours long, I felt like our main characters Jake and Neytiri didn't really ""do much"" in this film. Not that it's necessarily bad, since we got to see more of their children and people around them - but it felt odd sometimes. The movie also didn't feel that long in my opinion, so I guess that makes the pacing quite perfect.There aren't any acting standouts for me, except for Zoe Saldana's performances of when she was sad - which I feel like she was quite a lot in this film. I liked Sigourney Weaver's Kiri, though the voice didn't match the body - but I assume there's some genetic mystery which I might've missed in the beginning or is yet to be explained. I also didn't realize until I visited IMDB after the film that Kate Winslet starred in the movie, which was funny.The soundtrack is good at times, mostly rather cliché except for the main theme. The sound design on the other hand is pristine. I think it's fair to say that the film is beautiful but I don't know where the story will go from here other than the bad guys returning to cause more suffering to which the good guys will fight back in a visually stunning battle, only to have the bad guys survive and return in the next film(s) - five more? - for me of the same. I guess we'll see. Solid 7/10 for me though."
"Let's start with the negatives. It would have made a far better movie if it had been 1 hour shorter, especially given that the storyline is not exactly developed... If the movie had been shortened by only 30 seconds, the money not spent on special effects for those 30 seconds would have allowed them to hire a few more writers... for a decade or so.... special effects can fill a screen for 3 hours but that doesn't make a movieHaving said that, it was not a bad movie and is good entertainment much in the same vein as the first movie. The concept is as interesting and it does draw you in and the yes, the special effects do deliver...."
"When I watched the first one in cinemas recently , I was so blown away I couldn't even describe it.The feeling is still similar with this one, however I had some issues with the pacing. It just seemed like the side plots were all fighting for my eyes. They were all great, but I was left thinking ""what was I supposed to care about""I wasn't a big fan of the villain in all honesty. And some of the side characters were inconsistently fleshed out . There's one specific white character I thought should've never been added to the storyline but it wasn't too much damage.As always the best character neytiri was incredible. Everything about her screams pandora and Na'vi.Anyhow I still am very excited for the coming movies, I just hope the pacing is fixed."
Okay so lemme say that I like everyone else that had ever seen the first movie I had been patiently waiting for this cinematic Christmas present from avatar and it finally came for me over the weekend and Im gonna say it was worth the wait to return to pandora the action Level is high its a smart funny film with plenty of adventure but while it's a national treasure I recommend you don't take small children because due to the violence and adventure is extremely high and have potential to be frightening to kids and also due to extra long length I cannot say it's for kids but otherwise a perfect choice for Christmas.
"Man, huge disappointment....I went in with low expectations. Went with a group of 5 with my family to gather opinions. Unfortunately we did not escape into the avatar world like the first one.Cheesy lines, annoying characters, no character development. It's nice visually pleasing an audience but leaving out a great story line. Poor poor decisions on the script. It's going to be like fast & the furious, way to many movies and LA doesn't know when to quit. I personally wish I could refund, I just didn't enjoy it. I was amazed by visuals of course. But no backbone. Same enemy. Ughhhh so frustrating."
"I'm going to write a very short review (or opinion) here. The movie is super boring, it's like the story is written by a five-year-old. The former Avatar had great and sufficient amount of cgi, this one is like a video game! Honestly, wtf were those sudden zoom-ins?! Wtf were thise slowmos? Are you zack snyder? The story is super predictable and ends in a way that they can make the third one exactly in the same way. There is absolutely no progress in the story telling or world building. It's not bad at all, but you would expect more from a guy named James Cameron, or basically anyone who has been willing to make sequels after 10+ years, you would assume they had something interesting to tell. But naah, just add more cgi to make more money!Now time to talk about positive aspects, I haven't seen many movies that are as aesthetically pleasing. Yeah, pretty much that's all."
"Like many reviews I've seen, I found the focus of this film to be far too heavy on making it look good at the expense of making it a good story. Don't get me wrong, it really did look good. Many of the scenes would look right at home in an electronics store, showcasing just how good the pictures are. The problem is that I think that would be the best use for this film.In the first film there were captivating struggles of loyalty and responsibility, and I found myself really invested in the story and in the characters. This time that wasn't the case. I found the whole story to be pretty flat and lacking in any twists or turns, or really anything to make it interesting. Frustratingly that was only compounded by the ridiculous length of the film - it absolutely wasn't worth over 3 hours.Bringing children into it was presumably supposed to show a different side of the characters we'd seen before, and to add more weight to the struggles. However, for me it just didn't work. It was the same stuff again and again, and nothing particularly interesting. There was a lot of interaction without really generating any character depth and so largely seemed pretty pointless. What I really disliked was the voice of the eldest Sully daughter - whilst I understand why they did it, it just wasn't right at all and sounded ridiculous.It was a long time to wait for a sequel that sadly just wasn't really worth it. The first film had a lot of rewatch value and I'll happily watch it many more times yet, but the same can't be said for The Way of Water.For anyone interested in the film I'd highly recommend watching it on the big screen - if it's going to look good it might as well do it properly!"
"'Avatar: The Way of Water' follows Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) about 15 years after the events of the first film. Jake and Neytiri have have three biological children - Neteyam (Jamie Flatters), Lo'ak (Britain Dalton), and Tuk (Trinity Jo-Li Bliss), as well as two adopted children, Kiri (Sigourney Weaver) and a human child, Spider aka Miles Socorro (Jack Champion). Humans return to the world of Pandora under the command of General Ardmore (Edie Falco) and a new engram of Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) uploaded into an avatar. Jake becomes the target of an interstellar manhunt while he tries to protect his family by seeking help with the reef people, the Metkayina tribe.Visually this film is amazing! The ships, backgrounds, seemless transitions between CGI and camera work, the water scenes (which make up most of the film) are all very well done! The acting is as great as one would expect, given how the first film debuted, but the fault lies in the fact the film focuses almost solely on Jake Sully and family, with very little in the development of supporting characters; Norm (Joel David Moore) and Max (Dileep Patel) have cameos, rather than fleshed out roles, and Colonel Quaritch's team of mercenaries are as forgettable as the new general. The script is decent, but does leave some important plot holes open that will hopefully be addressed in the future releases.Worth a watch!"
"The film leaves you completely indifferent. Apart from the visual and definitely high-budget effects, this film had nothing to offer, for this plot the film lasts too long, but even after 3 hours of the film we did not manage to connect with the characters and feel empathy, so some deaths were not hard.. None that feeling after the movie. Very bad plots, and the whole film does not have a story of its own, it will probably serve only as a connection between the 1st and 3rd parts. The action of the film takes place in the water.. okay.. then why not use it to send a message about protecting the ocean.. it has only just begun (started) as well as certain characters, where a lot is left undefined. Somewhere I have the impression that, if this sequel had come out 3-5 years after the first part, it would have done much better, somewhere during that time it would have been wow, like this after 13 years, a weak sequel.I will wait for part 3."
"Pro:
Wonderful picturesWonderful water worlds with Aquatic lifeBeautiful looking and well animated human-like individualsThe facial expressions of the human-like creatures are extraordinarily well doneThere are many action sequences with explosions, shootouts and fight scenes. In some places it also gets bloody.Contra:
The story is nothing out of ordinary. Some of the stories told are already known from the first part and are repeated or based on the story of the first part.Hardly to almost no existing catchy sayings of the characters before or during action sequencesCharacters snarl at each other instead of calling a counterarm when people disagree with each otherSomeone who is not into family dramas will be annoyed at many parts of the movie.The movie has a very long running time."
"That first hour may be a little bit too much story and characters, but once we arrive at the water, there is no film of this year that can compare to the thrills that come our way. It's been a very long time that I've been in a movie theater with an audience that gives a roaring applause, not just once, but 3 times during a movie. Some know-it-all critics look too much at characters and story, while they miss out on the experience. Let yourself enjoy the journey! Many critics had negative reviews of 2001: A Space Odyssey when it came out too. Sometimes its not about the story, but the experience, and for that, I give this movie a 10/10."
"Let's be honest about this: Avatar: The Way of Water is not a worthy sequel of Avatar...because it's very different from Avatar.Don't watch this unless you watch it in a theater-esque environment...this is more of an experience than a movie. If you clearly want an audiovisual spectacle that will dazzle and make your emotions fly, then yes, go ahead and watch it. I lost my bound to gravity because of the feeling I got in the Cinema.If you want a story here, walk away. This is not a great script by any means, while Avatar had a clear theme with many meanings to walk away with, this sequel is not really a story worth watching. I still don't get why Quaritch wants Jake Sully dead (aside from the loss in battle) and all the subplots introduced are not really touched except from the relationship between Payatan and Lo'ak. In honest opinion...there's still hope that the script of the third Avatar movie will deliver answers to me and that the subplots that were not developed will be of more importance later on. I won't even discuss about the lack of meaningful messages, there were some nice ones but let's be real, it's no comparison to Avatar's messages.So, why should you watch this movie? Well, despite of the lacking script and messages, you can get a lot of action and pleasing visuals. This is a chance for you to watch something else instead of a Marvel movie...so take the chance and watch this. Just don't walk in expecting Avatar...the 13 years were apparently not taken into great advantage."
"Technically the film was well made and especially underwater the 3D effects were very nice, but that was it for me.For me the glorification of the military/marine and weapons were particularly annoying, with the lesson for the audience that you can only win with violence.Also the family life is marked by military drill all obey the father Jack Sully, the children call him sir and the wife is sometimes forbidden to speak, she is more like a practical soldier for him.The plot from Avatar 1 is repeated with a few Titanic scenes. Furthermore, the children had to be saved nearly four times...It was not worth the money, it was restless in the cinema because many people were watching the clock, there was no suspense and there were also illogical elements in the film."
"First of all, Avatar 2 is a stunning movie! When it comes down to the visuals, the viewers are invited for an enormous treat. They are gorgeous, magnificent, and absolutely breathtaking. Everything other than the actual screen simply ceases to exist. You just sit back and enjoy this piece of art.Now let's cover the content; story. It unfolds very peacefully and lets you grasp all the details as it unpacks. All new characters are properly and precisely introduced, and all returning characters' characteristics are built upon making them even stronger, more round. Everyone in this movie creates harmony on screen and a special bond with the viewers. You are literally sucked into Pandora!Moreover, everything is coherently explained. There are no major plotholes; perhaps none at all. It's just so cohesive. Despite the movie being a fantasy/action one, it is not bloated with any unrealistic actions. Everything portrayed is just so life-resembling; no nonsense.Last but definitely not least, the movie's title is just spot on. If you can figure out what it means, it will make a lot more sense.Perfect sequel. Can't wait for the third installment!11/10."
"Felt very similar to lots of the other reviews on here - film was great visually but story was very tiresome.It felt like they were trying to include as many movie cliches as possible- from annoying children persistently making bad decisions to a gunfight where someone dives out of the way thinking they are safe only to find out later they were hurt.Unfortunately I just didn't care about the characters, not any of them. I found Jake's children mostly to be a little annoying as we constantly saw them disobey their dad's orders to create action in the movie. This happened multiple times. The bad guy wasn't great either, I just didn't feel any connection to the characters.Also laughed when Jake and his family that made such a thing about being forest people were suddenly happy at the end to forgot the whole forest thing and call themselves water people.I really enjoyed the first movie but this one wasn't much at all, and I don't plan on watching anymore of them after this showing."
"Movie was fun, CGI was amazing, special op avatars were really cool, most acting was good. It's a fun watch for sure but they missed on a couple things.One thing that really bothered me and correct me if I'm wrong. The cost of the whale brain fluid. 48 million dollars for that vail. Assuming they harvested only one off of that whale, that is a horrible ROI. This is all speculation but here it is.Assuming they're 100 years ahead of us based on their technology, the autonomous building drones, skeletal robotic gear, space travel, etc. It's not SUPER advanced, they're still shooting bullets not lasers. At 100 years, with an average rage of 3-4% inflation: 100 dollars would be worth almost 1,000 usd. Meaning that their 48mil is worth 5 mil to us. Where is the ROI? The cost of the equipment used, the ships, the robotics, the salaries for each person is 10x higher than they would be today. A F-35 raptor (one of our highest tech able to mass produce) is at 80million today. What does that mean for equipment in 100 years?Am I thinking to much into this, yes. They were making such an amazing point to target big pharma, but the number was off.Also monkey boy or whatever wasn't that great of an actor, and was pretty annoying most of
The movie. Also why do all the kids have to tag along to every adventure?"
"So Avatar 2 turns out to be everything I expected it to be and not even a picogram more: technically impressive images (the detail of the human expressions on the alien faces really stand out) and a few very well-staged action scenes, all situated within a soul-numbingly dragged-out, tedious and instantly forgettable story, with no surprises of any kind at any point. I liked the stable and loving nuclear family aspect of it, but what is so out of step with the ""progressive"" agenda today would have been commonplace 25 years ago - which is when, to be honest, it feels like the script was written, too.The simplest and most accurate summation is just that it's the most expensive and highly detailed cartoon ever made, but once you know that, you really have no further reason to even see the film at all, and, just like the first Avatar, this is a movie that I already know for certain I will never watch again.4½ out of 10."
"When you see a beautiful flower you feel and react with your senses, don't you? Senses, like vision, smell, touch and also internal senses like breath expansion, muscular relaxation, brain calmness. Then, when you see another type of flower, underwater this time, of outstanding beauty, do you let yourself absorb the experience? Be there?""The way of the water"" is a contemporary, innovative, uniquely crafted artistic creation.Art depicts themes that often stem from ordinary basics of life, like nature, beauty, family. When you get yourself immersed in such an outstanding visual creation you may 'see' it, if you let that Na'vi phrase be personal for you.An awesome movie without trying to be."
"Before going to watch a movie I had high hopes for it.Watching it, it felt really amazing and also felt like I was in that world swimming together with them. They created really amazing and believable world and atmosphere.And that is the reason why I gave 8/10 , because of the effects and the work they have put in. Amazing work!But the main problem for me which I realized somewhere over the middle of the movie and closer to the end is that the plot is very primitive and empty...
If in the first movie humans came to the new planet in search for resources, and on the way they stumble upon the Local inhabitants, that are fighting for their land. Basically taking over the lands. Mixed up with love story.Then here in the second movie, everything is around revenge of one person. Yeah sure they showed that main character has family, etc. But at some moments they even use them as bait.... So they spend so many time and resources just to get revenge, in the end many locals and humans dies because of that... Was it worth it? After watching the movie I felt a bit disappointed by the plot, but amazed by the Visuals.But I do recommend to watch it to others just for the visuals alone."
"Shockingly poor story line and dismal character interactions. If the pull was purely the visual art (let's not worry about story), then just produce an instrumental, dialogue free film displaying the art. The failure of the characters' verbals distracted from what I presume took so long to produce. The core values of the world and spirit of the first film are lost, or just brushed over. I wanted to enjoy the film but it was not possible, it was laughably bad at times. Avatar was a 10, the way of the water was a 2. (Avatar Flight of Passage in Disney was a life time experience, this just frustrated)"
"""Reel Tunez, The Radio Show All About the Movies"" Movie Review (12/16/22): Avatar - The Way of WaterI wasn't necessarily looking forward to this, but watched the director's cut of the original Avatar last week. I thought ""it was okay... second one might be okay"". Wow!! I REALLY enjoyed this second Avatar.. even more than the first! A very emotional movie packed with so much to see and hear! I'm not a fan of 3D movies, but saw this one in 3D, and the 3D wasn't hokey or annoying, but VERY well done and subtle. The audio surround on the movie was incredible. Most importantly, the story line was GREAT!Don't want to give anything away.. but watch the original and definitely go see this new one (and see it on the BIG screen, in 3D if possible!) On a 1-10 scale (keep in mind I'm a tough reviewer), I'd give this a 7.3 out of 10.. and that's a VERY good rating for me."
"If you are familiar with Japanese culture you probably know what is an OVA.OVA is a special episode of something.This is called Avatar 2 but it could be resumed and incorporated in the first avatar with 5 min of extended movie.Its Avatar with biodiversity among an alien spieces ina an alien world.One spieces evolved technologically and another evolved their mind and mentality, but this is in the first movie.On the second the one the one that evolves their mentality and mind behaves like us, disgusting.There is the special effects but hey the first one also have special effects.Special performances? NONE.Cinematic achievements? NONE.What makes this movie do special? The money spent on it and the return of the profit?Probably too much rating for a special episode without substance of the great AVATAR.7 is a blessing becouse I still remember the first movie. Otherwise would be a 5."
"It's just sad that we had to wait 10 years for a movie that was clearly written by a gang of Disney Channel writers. There is the argument that the special effects are awesome, which they are but it doesn't justify the awfulness of this storyline.I am heartbroken by this movie, because the first one is a big part of my childhood, and this one is so bad that I will never look at the first one the same way.They clearly decided that it was a good idea to hire a bunch of national geographic nature documentary makers and spend the rest of the money in special effects, instead of investing even a little bit into a well thought script, or even a good music to accompany the movie.I couldn't even see how it ended because I must tell you that I have never been so bored in my entrie life.To conclude it's an awful script, subpar music, idiotic plot and great special effects. I am completely disappointed..."
"There is more to a movie then just graphics and thats all this is, a pretty movie with no substance. This movie was about 1 person's obsession with the main character Jake, then you add to the mix disobedient and cranky teenagers and you have a recipe for every movie in existence about a family with difficult teens.The last Jurassic Park had the same theme, disobedient teen! 1 billion dollars worth of graphics and a very bad story, it makes me sad really. I gave it 3 stars because the graphics are really good, but did I enjoy the movie overall? Thats a resounding NO. What a shame to wait all this time for a bad movie."
"Just watched the 3D in D-Box. The D-Box was a nice massage, but not sure it adds to the movie experience.Before coming hear, we read many many many reviews which praised the visuals but didn't like the story much. I beg to differ on the latter.The visuals (in 3D) were stunning, in my opinion, just as the original Avatar movie was. I first saw the original Avatar in at the theatre in 3D as well, which was probably my first (or one of my first) 3D movie experience(s), and, hands down, was visually beautiful with a very powerful message to us and our fellow earthlings and possible/future other fellow universe inhabitants.This one, however, was great. If I am honest I liked it even a little more than the original (although that one was ground-breaking in many ways for its time).My daughter and both enjoyed this new one a lot. I think it had just the right amount of emotion, message, action etc.NOT FOR CHILDREN: VIOLENCE,
WAR,KILLING, DEATH, SADNESS,BULLYING, HARMING/HURTING/KILLING OF ANIMALS (reason why I give it a 9 and not a 10)"
"...just please don't waste your time. Giving it one star only because the visuals are pretty stunning. However, it is still not worth your three and a half hours. I have never been so bored to want to walk out of a film before. The story is so very bad. There were three or four different plot lines that were unrelated and individually, equally lackluster. I only stayed because it was laughably horrible. My expectations were so high from the first movie, which I loved, and I was super disappointed. I came in very excited and unbiased. I honestly am unsure how it is getting any reviews above a four."
"Firstly, I have to point out, as so many others did already, that the visuals were outstanding, at times breath-taking. Seeing the movie in 3D was a major plus, although I believe it would still be beautiful in 2D. I enjoyed the change in scenery, that it is exploring the ocean tribe instead of the forest one.But, unfortunately, this is were the originality of the plot ends.The movie pretty much ends how it begins: with kids not following the rules and getting in dangerous situations, so the adults have to step in and save them. It also doesn't add anything new in terms of main conflict from the first Avatar, you pretty much see the same bad guy fighting Jake but in a slightly different context. Also why did the ocean tribe completely vanish in the middle of the final fight? Why didn't they help Jake and his family? Especially since the daughter of the tribe chief was still in danger, wouldn't he want to save her and thus help Jake? That for me didn't make any sense. Besides, the scene in which the ship was sinking was almost a one to one copy of Titanic sinking, that was just funny.I was also surprised by the fact that Jake decided to leave the forest tribe in order to protect his family but also to keep the tribe safe while joining another tribe, completely innocent, and lying by saying that the fighting days are over. How can you save a tribe by endangering another? That is just wrong. We never get to see what happens to the forest tribe after they leave, it feels like they it never mattered in the first place.All in all, the visuals definitely save the movie but it is not enough to make up for the weak plot. I am sure true fans of Avatar world will forgive almost anything the plot got wrong though. And guess what? Avatar 3 will be about the same old conflict between Jake and the Colonel, yay! Stay tuned."
"This isn't so much of a review but more of my overall thoughts about the film. I don't want to review it and add plot points. Best to go in blind and enjoy the spectacle.So, we've been waiting 13 years for this film and was it worth the wait? In my opinion, 100% YES!This is a James Cameron flex of the highest order. First of all, let me get all gooey-eyed about the visuals. In a world where CGI is the mainstream, and we've seen so much done in Marvel and DC movies, James Cameron has delivered a masterclass in eye-popping visuals that will leave your jaw on the floor. It is the most incredible eye candy I've ever seen on screen. The 3D is used so expertly here that you are sucked into the world of Pandora and the Navi. Overall, there are only two words that I can use, and they are ""F@cking Beautiful!"" Prepare to have your eyeballs massaged with the most incredible-looking visuals put to film.We all knew it would look good, but the billion-dollar question is, is the story good enough to go beyond the delicious visuals and add some gravitas to this already stunning-looking movie?Again, for me, the answer is YES!I've purposely not read any reviews for the film, but I am aware of a few negative reviews doing the rounds, and I'm scratching my head, trying to understand where this negativity comes from. I can't understand it.This film focuses so much more on family, and anyone with a family they love will get it. It's an emotionally charged rollercoaster ride, and the stakes are high. It's not very often I get super emotional with films, but when the credits rolled, I had to sit there for five minutes to compose myself. I was, essentially, an absolute emotional wreck, and that tells me all I need to know about how good I felt the story was. Cameron is a masterful director, and he pulled me in hook, line and sinker. I felt totally connected with the characters, why Jake was doing what he was doing for his family and the story's overall arc.This film is 3 hours long, and I wasn't bored for one second; I was that into it, although I feel that 15 mins could have been trimmed from the middle act; that's my only major nitpicking.The final hour is Cameron flexing his action movie muscle to the maximum. It's glorious, and we see a side to Neytiri that left me with my mouth open wide. It's both emotional and mind-blowing. That's all I'll say about that. I loved all the characters, and the new water tribe of the Navi are really cool. I particularly enjoyed Sigourney Weaver's role as Kiri, who delivers a memorable part of the film; again, I don't want to spoil it, but I thought it was such an incredible moment.If Avatar was Ridley Scott's Alien, then The Way of Water is Aliens.I loved this film, and I'll be thinking about it for days. 10/10."
"Why would James Cameron ask anyone to watch this movie? What would a person learn by enduring 3 hours of this non-sense?OK, the special effects were cool. Beautiful island nation with cool waterfalls and that gorgeous, teal-colored water from exotic locations everyone loves to post in their Instagram feed.But plot/story/character-development/reasons to make me care about this made-up world? I had a more interesting time holding the button down on my toaster this morning trying to toast my bagels because the spring is broken.The movie had some great potential in the beginning - the rocket ship that landed on the planet subsequently annihilating the jungle world was scary and had me wondering how in the world the Avatar-people could save themselves from this threat.Then the movie got weird.Colonel Quaritch 'wakes up' as a Na'vi, and the movie wants you to be fascinated at the thought of 'transferring' consciousness from one being to another, but then that all gets thrown away when we learn he's only interested in killing his arch-nemesis 'Jake'. ""Wow, the Na'vi are 9 feet tall, are faster, stronger, and can breathe under water???"" ""NOPE, DON'T CARE!!! GOTTA KILL THIS JAKE A**HOLE! CALL OF DUTY SQUAD UP!""Why did the teenagers keep saying ""Bro"" and ""Cuz""? It was so cringe. Did Cameron intend to portray them as today's youth? Not sure.Why did we have to spend 45 minutes watching a whale slowly die? And then the gruesome site of the whale's gigantic eyeball rolled up into its head for way longer than necessary. WHY???The most awkward character, perhaps in all of cinema, was Cliff Curtis's character, ""Tonowari"". Who was this man and why was he helping the Colonel hunt down Jake? He was sad, sort of like, ""Ha,ha, look how cruel we are to animals and whales, and dang are they an intelligent species and I secretly love them, but I'm a hypocrite and I'll still do this for a paycheck"". The whole thing just made me sad about first, the supposed (and no doubt real) cruelty of humans toward animals, but also sad so many people have gone to see this movie than literally any other movie. People could have learned a lot more about my toaster than going to see this.One last thing - if you have a mask that allows you to breath on an oxygen-less planet, shouldn't the mask fog up on the inside when you exhale?K I'm done."
"After the first hour which is basically Cameron making photoshots of Pandora the movie begins. We see humans are back to colonize Pandora and the marines from Avatar 1 turned into Na'vi. They waste an infinite amount of money, resources and Na'vi clones just to kill Jake Sully. Point is the whole prologue of Avatar 1 explains how expensive is to create Na'vi clones, something like 5 billion dollars each, they even hire Jake because is cheaper than start from the beginning...and in Avatar 2 they send a whole platoon of Na'vi marines to die in a war against our Jake that has literally no revenue for the humans and the profits they are in Pandora for. No big deaths and most of the legacy characters are forgotten just to give focus to Jake's sons in yet another teen drama adventure with no real content."
"This film was so boring.There are one or two moments where I actually enjoyed the film but I found most of it predictable and boring. The return of the same villein and continuation of using him is in my opinion, lazy, and the directors decision to create a new fire tribe after this is like he has gotten two films mixed up, making Jake the air bender instead of focusing on trying to stop the sky people.I will however say that the new creatures were beautiful and Pandora was breathtaking. I will also give props to the actors too as they had to spend years on the project and learn how to hold their breath for long periods of time."
"James Cameron surpassed himself once again with this gigant of a movie. I would recommend anyone to watch it just for the visuals because they are worth seeing at least once in one's lifetime. The crew spent over a year to develop the revolutionary underwater motion capture and it just paid off. Besides the visuals the movie excelled in its great cast and acting performances especially by Kate Winslet, Zoe Saldana and Sigourney Weaver (as Kiri). I am not going to lie, the plot left a lot to be desired. It was nothing special, it was simple and predictable. But there was really no need for that. Everything else made up for it. Another thing that needs to be highlighted is James Cameron's ability to keep a good pacing despite the exaggerated length of the movie. Just like Titanic and the first Avatar, you won't notice how long it takes because of the stunning visuals and storytelling. Definitely a must-see."
"That's 3 hours plus I won't get back ...hopefully there's not a directors cut on its way. Whilst the visuals were on another planet so to speak, I wondered in no particular order - where was Jack and Rose? , 'why so serious?' How can someone in a stranglehold asphyxiate under water ? And was this a bloated and dull version of 'Free Willy' set on Pandora? A talking whale asking 'how was the baby?' Was another popcorn choking moment. After the first groundbreaking Avatar and following 13 years of thought and development, the result was disappointing, surely a story first not a series of predictable links."
"Hard to belive that we bad to wait so long and in all that time the writers couldn't make a new story or at least an exciting one. How many times are we going to see this plot! Sure there are some differences but stripped down its a new version of the first movie.. Humans come, natives run, natives fight and we get many stunning CGI effects to pad the time and natives finally make up to begin fighting back.. I'm sure it'll make enough to launch a 3rd film but I hold no hope that the writers will do a good job, maybe its just that we've seen everything in Hollywood now or maybe it's just a case if them playing it safe but if the effects weren't so amazing this would be an average plot.. one you've seen many times before and no doubt will see again.. at some point Hollywood had to start catching up to its audience, I'll guess there's a million fans who could have created an original idea to make a perfect sequel but why bother when the CGI is good enough to stop people questioning an average plot.."
"Avatar 2 once again brings amazing visual effects to the table, completely entrancing my friends and me during our viewing in regular old RealD 3D, just as the first Avatar did back during its release. The immense amount of detail in the scenes containing water and pretty visuals of glowing characters and wildlife... it's all mesmerizing. That being said, certain scenes can be regarded as nearly cringeworthy, actors being assigned such simple reactionary dialogue as well as the plot containing shooting that would make a stormtrooper scoff at, and other things that make you wonder if this is truly the best Cameron could do. All in all, a movie worth seeing in theaters, but will it stand the test of time being regarded as a 8-star movie as technology improves and the CGI is no longer as impressive? I think not."
"This is an absolute spectacle from start to finish. You can't tell me otherwise. If you are in the theatre just for the thrills, you might find it boring cos it took it's time to develop the characters down to the animals and also the state of things in every environment the main characters found themselves. As soon as it got you immersed into their planet, it let rip with the thrills and boy!! It was always a sight to behold. Half of the things I thought were unnecessary, eventually played out to ensure that the movie despite being a fantasy of the highest order, played out naturally and as understandable as possible. This is nothing short of a classic. This is infact, everything Black Adam needed to be a monster hit. Top notch character development!"
"An overdue sequel to an incredible game changer back then.It does change the game yet again. It is visually STUNNING. The 3D effects are marvellous out of the water but then woah! In the water!!I can only imagine how difficult it must be to act in this movie and I think possibly Spider (Jack Champion) had the toughest job!The young talent were phenomenal and stood up very well against the more established stars of this now franchise. The soundtrack was wonderful too!Particular standout was the amazing footage, sea people v sky people.... and the amazing creature! Trying not to spoil here.Right, now on to why I didn't give it that 10(!)...I take issue a bit with the alpha-ness of the protagonist. In this world I don't see how being 'male' supersedes the 'female' role, especially when the protagonist isn't from the world! There was a few instances of this alpha crap I didn't enjoy.The antagonist is very cliché which I found irritating. Very 1990's bad guy. Tbf it was the same in the first movie. He was mostly one note throughout, barring one moment."
Watched it in IMAX but still was not impressed. I understand they did the Motion Capture underwater and it looks pretty smooth but the first Avatar had too many jaw dropping moments which were missing in this one. First Avatar was so good on cinematography and it was so colourful whereas this one was all blue. Story was also not that compelling although introducing new tribe was a good idea. First movie showed the relation with Eva more naturally while the Way of Water was bit more dramatic. Unless they have a good storyline or if they came up with a brand new Pandora they should shelve the idea of making another one. Overall movie is good bit lengthy but not boring.
"The film, as with the last one is just fluff, it's as though we are all stupid colonials and we are watching a groundbreaking, storytelling of a video game explain once again how these blue people are not only better than us but that we are idiots because we don't realize it, we are losers you see... don't you see? I loved THE ABYSS, Terminator, ALIENS... but this, nor it's first film achieve anything but virtue signaling and pathetic begging... what made Cameron's earlier work great was he cared about the audience and not the subject of the film... he wanted us to have fun in the 1980's and early 90's - but he fell into the trap of being told he could do no wrong (prob why his wife divorced him) and then made monuments to himself like ""titanic"" and the ""avatar"" era we are living through now - sad is what it is - Sad. Don't give your money or time to this, you can't get it back."
"A movie with great VFX is definitely a draw to the theater, but it is not what keeps me in the seat for over 3 hours. Sure, the movie boasts of stunning visuals and production design, but unfortunately the story and screenplay were not quite up to par. The movie had the potential to be a true blockbuster with its impressive visual effects but the narrative felt underdeveloped.If you're a fan of VFX, you might enjoy this movie, but be prepared for a somewhat underwhelming storyOn the whole, it was a pretty disappointing fare for me. Hope James Cameroon concentrates on the screenplay more than the visuals in the sequels to come."
"Technically this is state of the art I guess and this meets expectations. Impressive scenes and costumes. I assume the acting is great. It's a little bit hard for me to judge, because the faces are of course a bit artificial, but there are a couple of scenes that really touched me. I'm a little bit tired of the humans come and destroy everything and betray everyone along the way stories as well as of the standard final fight between good and bad (good almost wins, the bad guy is dead but he is not, then the good guy almost dies but finally he wins). And I think David Cameron missed a huge chance to raise attention: At the end of the movie, before the credits are running, only two sentences: x% of the population of earths ocean is already distinct and every day x football fields are burned down in the Amazon. I assume the majority of the audience would be emotionally open to this message after seeing this movie and some might think about it."
"I went to this movie with high expectations. The first one, back in 2009, truly impressed me. 13 years later they manage to make a poor sequel. I've seen the 2009 and 2022 both in 3D. The HFR version was under expectations.The camera movement was poor, too much useless movement, not cinematic at all. The 3D effects in few parts were great. I enjoyed to see how well the characters were built, especially the portraits. These are the only good parts.The story was average. Hard to understand why they'll go so much trouble for revenge and why any of the tribes did not defend their leader. Also in the middle of the movie Ney'tiri is just gone for a while.At the end I had a strong feeling of 'Titanic 2: Pandora way.'"
"The film is overall enjoyable, so if you're looking for a pleasant visual experience this film may be worth it. Beyond this, to be honest, everything is pretty mediocre. The plot is basic, linear and predictable. The ending is predictable, the dynamics between the characters - which are underdeveloped or unfinished - are predictable, the script is predictable.The most annoying thing however is: in 2023 can we please stop making films about stereotypical and toxic portraits of masculinity? (And I'm saying this as a man!) In this film all female characters - which are the more interesting ones - stay marginal, while men grunt and fight to save the work, protect the family and feed their fragile ego. Gurl please."
"Avatar is recycling itself.We took the same and we start over.Actually, would have probably been ok if the story was exactly the same. But a few additions to it added confusion actually.It will still be a good experience.But make no mistake, it's a no brainer.(Your brain was left at home....)Of course it's complicated for a movie to live up to its predecessor. And continue a story line left 13 years ago.Which I would argue the first 10 minute do a good job of.And then everything falls appart.Probably the movie tried to do too many things.And when you have too many good ideas it becomes a mess."
"Was sitting there really enjoying the intense and gorious scenes and scenery for over an hour. Saying to myself, I've got to tell my Brother to go see this. I was gushing when they arrived at the water peoples village.But after this approx 80mins in, OMG it gets really bad.Another movie where the director doesn't cut any scenes and the movie suffers tremendously for it.If this was cut by 70mins it would be a great movie, instead we get a bloated awful movie. Scenes such as the 'whale killing' to show us what these mercenaries were after to sell. The sinking ship at the end, the neverending fight at the end. The search back to the surface at the end. I could go on and on, quite disgraceful that a director leaves in so much droll, that should have been on the cutting room floor, ready for the 'directors cut release'...Quite sad really, could have been great!"
"Don't get me wrong, go watch avatar 2 it's great, for the visuals alone it's worth it. However a few hours after you leave the cinema you'll realize just how forgettable the movie is.The plot is a repeat of the first movie, and at its core it's silly, but that's not really what the movie is about, the movie is mainly about family and ""save the whales"". The first one was protecting forests, this one is about saving the whales. (Which to this day suffer cruel hunting and extinction). While forgettable the story does a good job at keeping you entertained and pushing its core message.The visuals are incredible, James Cameron has finally managed to push the boundaries of movie graphics once again, the characters move in accurate human like animation, while motion capture has been done since ages, never to this degree of detail and accuracy. The environments, colours and lighting are beautiful to look at. There is a big problem however, in its 3D format the movie suffers regularly from judder, this is a big distraction and very poor outcome considering the amount of work they put into the movie. It's such a shame James Cameron would not pick on thisThe soundtrack while great, was poorly used in the movie, this is a missed opportunity because they could've created really memorably scenes and taken the movie to another level had they used the soundtrack better.I really wanted to give this movie an 8, but I cannot because of the shortfalls in plot, writing, faulty 3D visuals judder, poor use of soundtrack and an overly lengthy third act."
"Finally after 13 years Cameron made a sequel to Avatar (2009). I was hoping for a spectacle like the first movie, but this one was a bit messy and was wrapped around family issues. Was that a bad thing? No.Avatar (2009) builds up slowly and gets his way towards the second half of the movie where all hell breaks loose into a war. There are so many friends, like Max, Trudy, Augustine, the other avatar driver (skinny guy, don't remember his name). They are mostly gone in the sequel. They are kind of replaced new people; Sully's family.In the sequel the war begins very fast. Bringing back the same threath of the first movie. Then we get to see the sea clan. That really is a treat. The bonding with the other clan, water animals. It was a delight to watch.Last part was a war again, messy, long. Villain still lives, don't know why. Then again, there are three more movies coming up. With the same war? Same villain? Is avatar about to become a bad Netflix series? Please don't. Stay creative. Don't deliver the same trick over and over, or avatar is doomed to die like The Terminator and The Matrix. For now, I give it the benefit of the doubt."
"As if you were in an Avatar body, siding along with Jake and Neytiri's family, you too must understand the importance of joining a clan of different Na'vi, learning the way of water, and why you need to defend your new home.The main theme explores being an outcast and learning to except the good and bad in people/animals/nature. Different movies should be viewed in a variety of ways. With Avatar WoW, anyone can emotionally involve themselves in the simplicities of the story by reflecting on our own lives. You want to learn how to breathe underwater, appreciate the beauty of the world around you, and never stick together with loved ones.The first act moves at a breathtaking pace in which you cannot wait to get to the shores of a new clan of Na'vi called the Metkayina clan. Once there, you don't want to leave. By the time the 3rd act comes, you understand why you cannot run from the threat of our main antagonist. And by the time the main action set piece of the film arrives, it's driven by the characters and plot that was built-up by the filmmaking as well as your personal connection to the themes.While it may not win an academy award for best script, it shouldn't. It's not that type of movie-going experience. It does deserve strong accolades at awards shows. It was worth 13 years of waiting and will be a film that sticks around indefinitely in the annals of film history."
"Cameron and his anti-human lunacy got tiresome very quick, space whales that are smarter than humans and can compose songs and write books.... pathetic stuff really.This joke of a movie also had so many plot holes it's astounding, HOW MANY TIMES DID THEY NEED SULLY IN THEIR SIGHTS TO ACTUALLY TAKE A SHOT AND KILL HIM? ...can't have that though, right? So predictable and lacking any form of suspense and gravity.One of the disposable son characters does finally go down but it took so much automatic gunfire that the marine avatars expended all their ammo!? Some good visuals though the aquatic cat-men are quite disturbing and ugly in comparison to the other ones.The best thing the cast had to say about this film is that ""it's avatar on steroids"".....steroids are not good."
"It is impossible to replicate the astonishment the first ""Avatar"" brought the audience thirteen years ago. CGI and 3D are now common amongst blockbuster movies.The film expands the world of Pandora. With new technology, Cameron is able to show the audience more aspects of the planet. The idea that water connects everything isn't the most innovative, but it works well in this movie.However, the antagonist, Quaritch, still needs a stronger motivation. The pacing at the beginning is rushed, and some action scenes just drag on for too long. But no director can incorporate beautiful visuals with epic action scenes like James Cameron. All the action sequences are epic and stunning.Even though the themes of family and responsibility are suppose to be a big part, it can be too surface level at times. And finally, the film just doesn't work during scenes that are obviously trying to make you cry. It seems like Cameron is more interested in the technology than the actual story. Just like the first ""Avatar"", this is a film that relies on its visuals rather than acting or writing. It's still a nice experience that falls apart for certain parts."
"As expected by the budget and length to produce the CGI effects were wonderful, but I wish they had spent more time in the story / character development. The movie turns out to be a three hour long showcase of what a team can do with current technology. But after you get past the visual effects, the story gets stale and you begin to lose interest in the characters. There appeared to be a lot of B-roll that simply was not important in the story telling. The film began to lose the audience attention roughly halfway through and I noticed quite a few people getting up to use the washroom. The character development was limited also to a person's perception of the dialogue, you never really feel emotionally attached. I saw the movie in 3D and would recommend that format, but that is the only recommendation I can make for this film."
"I as well as many others grew up loving the first movie. Never had I ever seen anything like it as a child, watched the first movie more times than I remember. Young me fell in love with the nature, the beauty, the relations, the interior conflicts within each character. The story might have been simple and straight forward but that's what I loved about it. I loved the relations, the characters, the nature, the conflicts within and outside.I couldn't believe when I walked out of the cinemas that James Cameron managed to capture the same feelings but better and just as uniquely. But the effects made me forget I was a sci-fi movie. I usually love seeing details in VFX and disecting scenes, and often you really notice it. But never have I seen a specticle that compare to this. There is nothing I can complain about, the beauty of the effects are almost to good. I've never been so invested in something that I completely forget it's real. James Cameron and his team made everything feel real. But the previously mentioned criterias for why I loved the first movie were done even better. Kiri's and Lo'ak's journeys throughout the movie are beautiful, I absolutely love what the Writing Team did to them.Before I go to bananas writing over my overly excited self I will conclude shortly why I PERSONALLY think it's a 10/10.Everything I've wanted, simple understandble story/plot, relatble and compelling characters, slow but engaging narrative, a complete unique world with completely unique life, beauty, long gorgeous shots, drawn out beautful scenes that set the tone and feeling of the moment. And atop it all a visual masterpiece beyond previous imagination. Visuals that captures the viewer in the world of Pandora so strongly that you forget you're in a cinema. Visuals so real the the reals thing(humans) feel odd and wrong. Visuals I get sad when I see the real world. Visuals so good it inspires me to help preserve our Pandora.I can go on and on about what makes this movie so great for me. I'm not blind to some of the criticism the movie has faced, but for mre it's all irrellivent to the experience that I wanted and got.Thank you again James."
"Like the majority of the reviews: very nice visually, but the dialogue or the lack of it was overwhelming. Got a numb feeling of realizing it's just a duplicate of the last movie, but with more water. The villains had no energy, no anger, no feeling. The threat was so bland and the action sequences were short and forgetful. Scenes dragged I suppose to keep you in awe of the visuals. The family had moments, but not enough to really have a huge impact. Lastly, I don't know who approved the uses of new teenage slang like the word(cuh), but that was also not needed. It feels like the type of movie that does not need that type of content they are on another planet after all... It's Just my opinion."
"If you liked the first one, you should like this one. Cool special effects, mediocre story and acting, along with the theme, natives and nature are good, military and science is bad. This movie is really for 9-18 year olds, since they're the main focus. As an adult I really struggled to stay interested, and as always the 3D is cool until about 30 minutes in, and then it's the same old same old. The movie is too long, and while some of the CGI is really good, some of it seemed mediocre. Some of the Navi and the sea people looked unnatural. The bad guys looked ridiculous at times, and head shapes of characters ranged from too big to too small for the body. The bad guys are the worst part of the story. It's often lazy writing to bring back same problems just different background. I couldn't understand how someone's vendetta became the main conflict of the story and everyone in the movie was okay with it, and characters on both sides supported it. This one has nothing to do with unobtanium, the driving force for the last film, (stealing from the gold rush). It seemed like it would steal from the American West, and people coming to colonize Pandora just as early pioneers and natives conflicted in American history, but worse it just goes back to the same old players not liking each other. The snarling gets old, and while it has moments. It's not a movie you'll likely want to see more than once."
"I'll say this first, I think this movie is really great, and I will probably go see it again. Having said that, there are a lot of things that Cameron chooses not to engage in with this story. 1. In the time between A1 and A2, did they do nothing to prepare for the Sky People return. Jake Sully surely knew they were coming back, yet they all seemed caught off guard when it happened. 2. Jake's first thought is to run. Not send the kids off somewhere, but to run with the whole family seems like wishful thinking i his part that they wouldn't chase him down. 3. Cameron ignored the larger fight that encompassed A1 to focus on the revenge theme which is much smaller, and really probably is a distraction from the bigger fact that when the Humans come back, they aren't coming back to be nice this time. Pandoran Global War is the likely reality, and we just gloss over that completely. I'm really interested to see where A3-5 take the story line."
I think I've seen this...oh wait I did it was avatar 1. Could we have come up with a new story not just the same one as the first. This time around obviously less was spent on writing. I also don't think 3d adds much to the movie. Often annoying and poorly thought comments are made by each of the main charactersthat as nothing more than a distraction. My God u couldn't even come up with a new threat u had to revive a dead on. The very few original scenarios weren't even explained. The new characters in the film were poorly chosen and come off as high school play actors and not from a major motion picture. Want to stream it especially since you will vest 3 hours I'm it.
"Here it goes. I have been waiting for this movie for a damn long time and I am not disappointed in any way. It has been said before, but the visuals were insanely stunning and Cameron took the time needed to make the viewer familiar with the new environment.I understand that some people were not too happy with the story of the first Avatar, and even though this one isn't perfect either, it is a massive step up. I've read that the actions of the characters are illogical and cheap devices to further the plot, but honestly, I'd disagree. We see the main characters broken down, struggling to make sense in an ever changing world and be confronted with their own mistakes and further marvels that they don't understand.I agree, that some of the smaller arcs very predictable and seen before in action, drama or coming of age movies. But all in all i was honestly surprised by the direction some of the characters were taken.This movie begins to give the torch down from the elder to a younger generation and, even thought a massive climax is missing, it sets up further movies to come beautifully. This is, as we shouldn't forget, part 2 of 5. And I'm all in for more to come.Watch it, enjoy a beautiful story in a fascinating visual setting, and don't overthink every single little detail. I can even recommend 3D for it."
"Mr James Cameron, I loved Avatar 1. But Avatar 2 really disappointed me.I had no problem with the actors; they were great. The CGI was, of course, amazing.The problem that I had was the story.In Avatar 1, the story was focused in the forest and we got to explore in detail the way of the Omaticaya clan, and Jake's journey in this 1 context. All characters were at least somewhat fleshed out, and there was a smooth continuity throughout the film from newbie to warrior.In Avatar 2, we explored too many different contexts with rough, clunky transitions; none of these contexts were focused on in as much detail as in the first film. We jump from children Na'vi, to space, to insurgent Na'vi, to Quarritch, to Spider's relationship to Quarritch, to the floating mountains, to the family fleeing, to the recoms getting Ikrans, to the Metcayina, to learning the Metcayina's ways, to whales being able to communicate with the Na'vi, to whaling, to Kiri having the power to connect with nature in a supernatural way, to the humans arriving to the Islands, to the Na'vi getting ready for battle, to the battle, and then the funeral. That was too much of too different contexts going on. Not smooth at all; too clunky, and, sorry, but, annoying. And since none of these different contexts were explored with enough detail (in my opinion), some of the things that were happening seemed a bit weird (e.g. The random Maori behaviours from the Metcayina - it was weird because it came out of nowhere and felt forced; would have been better if we had gotten to know the Metcayina better + the Whale's brain liquid that grants immortality to humans being one of the reasons to be in Pandora; what about Unobtainium?? And what's wrong with planet Earth!?).I would have loved to have gotten to know the recoms more and spend more time with them to see how the planet would have affected them now that they have an Avatar body. But instead they were just soldiers who nearly all got killed; boring, what's the point in that?I would have loved to have stayed in the forest to have gotten to know the kids as well and Jake's new position as clan leader. That would have been awesome!Basically, if you had made a move about Jake's new role as both parent and clan leader, the family dynamic and children's development in the forest, AND the recoms' development as recoms on Pandora, plus them hunting down the family and the clan, THEN I would have probably loved the film. Then the next film could have been about them fleeing to the sea!The reason I loved Avatar 1 was because I fell in love with the world and felt like I was there in the forest. But in Avatar 2, I felt like I was all over the place and did not connect with anything. I did not feel like I was on Pandora. I'm sorry to say but I got a completely different feeling from this movie, and it was a feeling of detachment, with appreciation for the special effects.I really wanted to like this. But what I decided to do after I left the cinema this evening was forget that this movie was made, so that I can just focus on the first film, which I ABSOLUTELY LOVED. For Way of Water, the trailers were better than the actual film...which I really hate to say.The theme of family for this movie was a wonderful, beautiful, fantastic idea! But it was ruined by the lack of continuity and too many different contexts.I love the actors, and I love the ideas behind the film; I just don't like the film.I hope you understand what I am saying."
"From the director who created one of the best sequels ever ( terminator 2) i expected a little more than just top notch visuals. The boring characters who made the most obivious choices, the same storylines from the first movie, the same villians.. and why does every character in this movie has to be an outcast and special, the storylines feel very boring and it makes a movie who is already very long, longer. The worst part and that is the main reason i would not recommend this movie are the same storylines from the first movie. It makes your characters boring and that is not what i expect...."
"Gotta hand it to this film. I have lost count of how many reviews I have read on this site and this film was the one I hated enough that made me join the fray. The 4 stars are for Weta digital and Weta digital only. Brilliant effects do not a good film make. Completely incoherent script and wooden performances top to bottom. Literally cringed any time any of the child actors spoke or in the case of the human kid just sat there and stared attempting to convey intensity, who by the way had an arc that made zero sense whatsoever. The Deus Ex Machina was all kinds of predictable and the stakes were completely removed in an effort to bring Steven Lang back. They set up yet another sequel that will likely give us 3 more hours of very pretty colors. Save your money and go to an art exhibit. Or just watch paint dry. Both better options than this film."
"I'm just amazed from start to finish. This is what imax 3D was made for. The Visuals is really stunning and the details from smallest to largest creature are well thought of. I like how the story, though not complex, still thrived to match the energy of the movie's visual extravaganza. How the movie championed the cgi underwater is just so genius.The only thing I would wish was enhanced was how the movie crammed the first 15 minutes to establish the story of The Way of the Water, leaving the important links on first movie off the spotlight. Also, the biggest elephant in the room introduced in the movie is not entertained that much; Earth dying and taking over Pandora. Making me think that a 3rd movie coming in and had to wait for a decade yet again."
"The only reason this gets a 6 is because the CGI is amazing and it is beautiful. The world building (like the first one), is the best part of the film. However there are several reasons why the film doesn't work for me in terms of plot:1. It requires characters to be stupid 24/72. Same bad guy is lazy and felt unoriginal. Somehow in this amazing world it comes back to the same awful character from the first film.3. They leave the forest because they don't want to endanger the na'vi...yet when the bad guys find them with the water tribe they seem ok to stay and fight and let others be put in harms way? It makes no sense.4. The dialogue is painful at times.5. The acting is not good. Sam Worthington still hasn't learnt to do an American accent in the decade plus since the first film.6. It is at least 30-45 minutes too long."
"I have just wasted my money on movie tickets. Movie is streched too much Anonymously, there is no much strength in in the story line.Avatar 1 had a good story line and was much better than second part.It's just a wastage of time and money.I

"Look, I get that it's not a perfect movie. The script could be a lot tighter and there's no doubt a bit of bloat, and, along with some plot holes, you do have some character motivations that don't make a ton of sense, but if you grade this film like you would a figure skater, where difficulty of routine and ingenuity is going to increase potential score well beyond that skater that has great technique, but doesn't take risks, then this one is an all timer.Visually, it is simply the best looking computer generated film of all time. Every second, I was in complete awe of the beauty of the dang thing, and the incredible, painstaking attention to detail that made an almost entirely animated world come to life. The water scenes in particular were breathtaking...I felt like a child oohing and aahing at every single image, calling out to daddy James Cameron to ""Do it again dad! Do it again!""And I never tired of it either. One of the weakest moments of the film was when Jake decided the family needed to leave the forest and find a new home, a move that called into question the motivations of all sides of the conflict. I could've easily been sidetracked by this oversight, but it was obvious that Cameron was just looking for any old reason to get the Sullys out of the forest and into the water. Once they do get there, though, this transforms into an hour and a half long hang out movie, where you just spend time with this family as they acquaint themselves with their new surroundings and develop relationships with the Metkayina.I can't even imagine how a pitch like this might go to a Disney exec:""So, i want these characters to just go to some tropical land, ingratiate themselves with the natives, learn their ways and spend a lot of time underwater, where I can showcase this new technology that makes computer generated water look absolutely real. What's that? What's going to happen? Just what I said. They're going to hang out and learn the environment. Yep...for an hour and a half. No sir, nothing is actually going to move the plot of the movie forward during this time. Yes. I'm confident that it will be incredible and people will pay out the nose to watch it in 3D in IMAX. What's that? Why should you trust me on this? Because my name is James Freaking Cameron.""And you know what? I, for one, am here for all of it. I could've handled another two hours of chilling in Hawaii with the Sullys. Could've been content to leave it all there for the rest of the movie tbh, but, you know Cameron had to go ahead and throw it all together with the greatest CGI action finale I've ever seen. The dude is an absolute mensch.The thing that impressed me the most about all of this, was that Cameron has actually...unbelievably...here... right now...in 2022 given us a grand, sprawling epic, with unbelievably well constructed action set pieces and choreography, perfectly integrated with the greatest imaging ever put to celluloid and it's going to make bazillion dollars and it is not rooted in IPs that are more that fifty years old that have been culturally defining, vehicles of nostalgia. He actually created something that is his own, and he's poured almost twenty years of his life into making it something great and he doesn't really care what expectations the pundits and critics and execs (or even public for that matter) are attempting to place on his shoulders. He's just making something that he loves, that includes all of the stuff he's interested in and all the themes he wants to reflect on. It's his movie...and it's a game changer. I can't predict how everyone's going to take it, but man I sure do hope this thing has legs. I hope Cameron keeps getting all the money he needs to finish making this series. I'm in James. IN!!!One more thing: I love that, as it expands in grandeur, it contracts thematically, moving from global issues to family ones. This film is ultimately a reflection on family: what it means to be in one and what our collective responsibilities are to each other. I fell absolutely in love with each of them and can't wait to see where their stories take us in the next few years. The strengths and weakness of each one weave perfectly together and contribute to making the collective strong.""Wherever we go, this family is our fortress. A father protects. It's what gives him meaning."""
"It's a sequel.And I was really looking forward to this. And...well...it was solid movie making. And one part of movie making is made up of how a movie looks and feels. So, effects and production design. And yes, jaw dropping, pure and simple. A milestone in cinematography. But then there's more to moviemaking than this. And that's where, in my humble opinion, this movie failed as much as it triumphed with its effects. Yes, it will sell a lot of tickets. But not because, like no1, word of mouth made it the success it is today. It won't even come close to no1. And it doesn't have to. After all, it's a sequel. A very long one though."
"In James Cameron's epic science fiction sequel Avatar: The Way of Water, Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldaña reprise their roles as Jake Sully and Neytiri, the young lovers who defied all odds to be together, even though they were literally from different worlds. Their passionate affair crossed not only cultural divides, but also the boundary between two species - human and Na'vi - and in doing so positioned the theme of diversity in the middle of Avatar's beautiful beating heart.In this triumphant return to the exotic world of Pandora, Cameron once again puts the same theme front and center. Set fourteen years after the first film, Avatar: The Way of Water begins with a montage introducing Jake and Neytiri's family, which is unashamedly diverse. In addition to their three mixed-race children - Neteyam (Jamie Flatters), Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) and Tuktirey (Trinity Jo-Li Bliss) - they have also adopted Kiri (Sigourney Weaver), the teenage daughter of the avatar of Dr. Grace Augustine, Weaver's character in the original film. Completing the ensemble is the human boy Spider (Jack Champion), son of the villainous Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), who accompanies Jake and Neytiri's kids wherever they go.Life is good for the family in their jungle idyll. But all too soon a new human invasion forces them to flee their home. They eventually join the reef-dwelling Metkayina clan, only to meet with undisguised prejudice. As a human in a Na'vi body, Jake is regarded with suspicion and hostility, despite his status as 'Toruk Makto,' the noble warrior who led the Omaticaya clan to victory in the first film. His children are reviled as half-breeds.But the prejudice goes deeper. They are all different here - even Neytiri, despite the fact she is a true native of Pandora. Their Omaticaya skin is deep blue, not the pale aquamarine of the Metkayina. They lack the deep chests, broad tails and fin-like limb extensions that allow the reef-dwellers to swim freely in Pandora's ocean. They are different. They do not fit in. They are other.The fugitive family confront these prejudices head-on and gradually find acceptance in their new home, although the journey is not without its difficulties. As this particular strand of the story unfolds, the film's multi-layered approach to discrimination - human/Na'vi, Omaticaya/Metkayina - brings a creditable complexity and depth to the narrative.Integration into the Metkayina clan brings new stability to the lives of Jake and his family. But the peace does not last. Resurrected into an avatar body, the ruthless Quaritch is determined to track down Jake and kill him. In order to do so, he requisitions one of the huge ocean vessels used by the humans to hunt Tulkun - intelligent ocean-dwelling giants resembling terrestrial whales.Ultimately we learn the reason why the Tulkun are being hunted - they have glands that secrete a liquid called 'amrita,' which is said to stop human aging in its tracks. Amrita is highly prized - more precious than the gravity-defying 'unobtainium' mineral that drove humans to ravage Pandora in the original Avatar. Having abandoned their unobtainium mines, the human invaders now have no qualms in slaughtering the majestic Tulkun simply to secure a few tiny vials of priceless amrita.In narrative terms, replacing unobtainium with amrita is a masterful move by Cameron. Exotic though it is, unobtainium is just an inert mineral. By harvesting amrita, the human antagonists of the new film are committing an act of violence against a sentient species, and Cameron pulls no punches as he shows us their ruthless methods in dreadful, bloody detail. This brings a profoundly emotional dimension to another of the film's central themes: the exploitation of the natural world.Once more, this theme is multi-layered. To dial up the emotion still further, the Metkayina clan share a deep bond with the Tulkun - every individual in the clan has a Tulkun 'spirit-sibling.' When Jake's son Lo'ak befriends an outcast Tulkun called Payakan, the dreadful plight of these ocean giants becomes deeply personal to him and his family - and therefore to us, the audience.The timely ecological message of Avatar: The Way of Water continues with glimpses of Kiri's growing bond with Eywa, the planet-spanning consciousness that connects all life on Pandora. Eywa brings to mind the Greek myth of Gaia, the Earth Mother, herself a variant of more primitive deities representing creation, fertility and the bounty of nature. Through Eywa, the Avatar films transport the most ancient of Earthly myths far out into the depths of space, where they find new life and meaning.The third principle theme of Avatar: The Way of Water is family. Through the first half of the film, Cameron devotes himself to portraying the complex dynamics within Jake and Neytiri's family. All parents of teenagers will recognize the constant ebb and flow of devotion, rebellion and sibling rivalry that accompany these turbulent years. Jake's parenting is authoritative, no doubt shaped by his military background, but moderated by Neytiri's more rounded philosophies. Even the bad guy, Quaritch gets to explore the challenges of parenthood as he gradually gets to know his forgotten son, Spider.Setting these underlying themes aside, Avatar: The Way of Waterbenefits from a simple narrative to drive the action - a narrative that recalls many of Cameron's most successful films. In his obsessive pursuit of Jake, Quaritch is as unstoppable as a T-1000 Terminator. The unrelenting action of the movie's spectacular third act pays homage to both The Abyss and Titanic. However, at no time does Cameron simply fall back on his playbook. Instead, the nods and homages establish a recognizable frame within which the filmmaker is free to paint the most extraordinary pictures. Let there be no doubt - Avatar: The Way of Water is truly gorgeous to behold.Cameron begins work on his canvas by presenting the world of Pandora with deceptively simple broad strokes, before immersing the audience in this fully realized alien realm. The establishing scenes are slow and lyrical, with each shot revealing yet another glorious vista. The ocean sequences are dazzling and filled with endless detail, so that by the time we reach the spectacle of the final battle we feel that we are literally swimming in the waters of Pandora. Thanks to the innovative virtual production techniques, and the extraordinary talent of the visual effects team at Weta FX, Pandora and its inhabitants are never less than utterly convincing, and filled with true emotion.As with the first film, audiences will undoubtedly leave the cinema with their minds and hearts filled with color. James Cameron's imaginary universe is so vibrant, so convincing, and so unforgettable, that we are reluctant to leave it behind and re-enter the drab reality of the real world.Yet, the real triumph of Avatar: The Way of Water is that the film reminds us that our world is not drab. In fact, the reverse is true. The forests and oceans of our own planet Earth are filled with just as many wonders as those of Pandora. Perhaps more. We live in a miracle, and the miracle is right in front of us. It has been here all the time. All we need to do is open our eyes and embrace our world with the Na'vi phrase of welcome and love: ""I see you."""
"After watching its definitely not as good as the first. Its very rare for a sequel to out perform the first movie, however they produced a great film that didn't dissatisfy.The film quality and effect were there, maybe a bit too much action and not enough buildup of the plot but overall 8/10 would recommend.This is a film that was built for cinema, I recommend watching in Imax for the best experience. This films makes cinemas thrive. The length of the film some say is too long but for cinema lovers, this is the perfect amount of time. It flew by and before I knew it, the final scene wa there."
"I can say that I liked it more than the first Avatar, but I think that's just something from me. In any case, it's not the best movie of 2022. Visually, I have nothing to say, it's by far the best CGI I've seen so far and I don't think it will change until the next one, the details of the world are incredible as well and the action scenes that are very well executed, so technically I really have nothing to complain about. When it comes to the story, yes, it is weak, but at least it focuses a lot on the characters, which I liked because they are another strong point of the film. I can say that the dialogue is irritating, even bad, but I could get over it. So my rating is based a lot on the experience in the cinema, which was unforgettable, which doesn't happen often."
"Great visuals, no issues here. But the major issue is the story. It's the exact same story as the first one but with their children and in the water this time instead of the forest. Reviving the Colonel into an Avatar, super bad idea... Why does this guy have a kid? So the bad guy's kid can interact with the good guy's kids.... Seriously... The whole story was super predictable has it developed. It really feels like they recycled the first movie story. I seriously do not understand how come the rating is that high right now. Now Where will they be for the next movie? Underground with people that lives near the center of the planet?"
"This is clearly CGI at its absolute best. The beginning was a bit slow and takes a little while to get through, but it makes it up way over my expectations! I literally cried during the movie in several places.You will experience anger, sadness, laughter and fright.Breathtaking views of the planet, both above ground and below the seas, strange and beautiful creatures and plant life, solid plot and strong, beautiful characters, I would highly recommend this film to anyone who likes this type of science fiction!You really need to watch the first one to completely understand this one. We'll worth it!"
"The scenery in this movie is quite amazing, especially if you are watching it in the movie theaters. The action deserves a lot of praise except for 3 aspects. First, there is a high degree to which it's unrealistic. Second, when there is hardship or loss among the good guys, it simply comes off as arbitrary. Third, the movie does not justify to me why the bad guy does what he does of hunting down the good guys (there's a bit of a story to it, but I just don't feel it).Yes, the themes of family and adjusting to a new home are present. And yes, this is a feel-good movie. But after having just gotten done watching it, it feels the movie was all over the place, the bad guy did not really have a concrete plan and, to the extent that he did have a concrete plan, the movie did not do to justify it. He kept, randomly, taking hostage kids, and doing the consent 'hey, if you want your kids, come alone.' And after that failed, he tried again. In other words, the bad guy is made to be aggressive and dumb."
Does anyone want this movie? Does anyone need this movie? Nope to both. The original movie was such a success because everyone wanted to experience the technology and to be honest the story in the first movie was far from original and no where near as ground breaking as the visuals tbh it was a little boring.No one cares about the Navi individually or as a whole and whilst there might be some under lying moral about the exploitation of indigenous people it's lost here on family Sully. A dad dealing with uppirty teens YAWN.Effect's as good as these are now the norm and can be seen done better when done less. Too much cgi these days is a negative and these movies are too much. This movie lack originality the same villain the same hero's largely the same story with a couple of teaks. The only good thing is that I'll know not to bother sitting through the rest.Underwhelming at best but then that's the legacy of the first one nothing will be that ground breaking again which leaves any sequel floundering in it's wake.If you were the 'sky people' and you were really intent on killing everything that moves you'd just do it from orbit.An unnecessary movie with an unnecessary plot. With characters you just don't care about.
"The first Avatar was barely watchable with your 3D glasses on: all that colour and magnificent visual effects trying to shroud an otherwise simple plot. Script is key here and that holds your attention but immediately after the credits roll you are left wondering what in god's name did you just watch?! Post Titanic Cameron never really made a comeback and he has managed to infuse feel good vibes into the Avatar movies and the latest instalment is no different! Shut your brain off and smile languidly as the film rolls on, seriously there is no thought to it otherwise. One would hope this concludes this tiresome series but we are told another final film is in the wings?! Not recommended."
"It feels like James Cameron will continue to blow your mind away but also disappoint you big time. The only two movies from JC that I like is T2 and Titanic which are nearly perfect.In this one again, you have the spectacular visual effects and action scenes. On the other end, the story is very weak.One big problem is the number of incoherence throughout the movie, here is a list :
1. A whale, as intelligent as it might be is an aquatic 'monster' and there is no way it could defeat an army of well trained soldiers 'on land'.2. There are too few casualties among the Navis compare to the soldiers especially considering they have weaker weapons.3. There is no way an arrow can go through a windshield cockpit and kill the pilot like it did twice.4. Why did Jake almost gave up when he was trapped under the ship and didn't even try to save himself ? Only his son helped convinced him to do so.I could go on and on ...
It really felt like a Cameron movie but not in a good way...."
"*spoilers at bottom*Look, it's pretty. It really is. The astounding visuals cannot make up for the 3 hours of hollow storytelling, though. This legitimately feels like a fan fiction written by a 14 year old after the first movie came out. Not only is it more or less a repeat of the first movie (Wow look, a tribe of blue people whose ways and culture we have to learn. Oh look, sky people. Whatever shall we do.), but it is missing all of the first movies charming moments. There is no character chemistry at all. Nobody has a unique or individual personality. Every line of dialogue (mostly on the human side of things) was dry and laughable. And none of the characters make a single good decision.*Spoiler Zone*I cannot believe James Cameron said, ""You know what this movie needs? A memory-infused Avatar that is literally the villain that we killed off 12 years ago."" Even if it was a good villain, which a character whose entire personality is being a marine is not, it would be absolutely ridiculous. And then, to keep him alive at the end of this movie to set him up for another sequel in which his goal will once again be kill Jake Sully is absolutely wild.On top of that, the entire 3rd act is Titanic? My fiancé and I were sat in the theatre laughing at every integral part of the story, because it was all just hilariously comedic.With that said, it's a lot of fun. It's not that it is unwatchable, because, as I said, it's eye candy. I just wish I would have felt something towards any of the characters. If you're going to see it, see it in IMAX 3D and enjoy it for what it is, which is a cinematic spectacle paired with a bad fan fiction."
"This movie is a missed opportunity to explore ideas about colonialism, first contact, and the relationship between man and nature. These ideas were touched upon in the first movie, but I was disappointed that the movie did not delve into them with the depth that I wanted, and the narrative soon turned to a big budget action flick. This is even worse with this sequel, rehashing the plot, characters, and ideas again without really expanding on the ideas or philosophies being explored. This means that Cameroon just made another big budget flick that wows with its special effects and can be used to test out your new TV. Of course, this makes it a spectacle worth watching just to see the latest technologies and cinematographic quality of Hollywood.In terms of entertainment, the comedy in the movie is filled with overplayed lines that really don't land. The dramatic elements of the narrative, subplots and such are also very cliché. The action, however, is what is intensely captivating and carries this movie. There are multiple scenes that are truly suspenseful and masterfully done. Nonetheless, the movie feels too long for a glorified action flick. Furthermore, it is quite clear from the end that there will probably be an Avatar #3 if not more where they milk the franchise even more. Hopefully, that one will surprise us with the depth that we have been looking for."
"The review contains spoilers. We waited. Yeah, I don't believe it either, but I saw Avatar: The Way of Water in the cinema, and after 13 years, James Cameron brings us a sequel to the most successful film of all time. And here are my thoughts, there are plenty of them. I'll start with by far the best part of the entire film, and that is without a doubt the visual aspect of the film - CGI. The visual effects are possibly the best I've ever seen in a movie. The water that is found in this film in a really big way is photorealistic but in a newsy way. Even on CGI characters, it looks perfect and I wondered how Cameron could do it again. It can be seen that he really wants to be the best in this and he is succeeding. Sure, the movie apparently cost almost half a billion dollars, even if it looks bad, but Cameron squeezed the money 180% and it shows in every money shot. The whole movie is one big highlight visual. Admirable and groundbreaking. Those fish and all kinds of monsters in that sea looked absolutely wonderful, and about the second third of the film shows us all of it in full splendor. All those animals, plants, and sky - beauty. And this admiration of the world really does not get tired, because Cameron staged the film in a really exemplary way. The 192 minutes went by pretty much painlessly and I didn't feel that at any point the film suffered from a lack of fun. But for that, I think that the film suffers a lot in one thing, and that's exactly why it's not full fire from me this time - the script and the plot itself. I really don't want to claim that the film has the same story as in the unit, but - it actually does. And unfortunately, I also have the feeling that nothing extra was resolved in this movie, or I didn't feel any great catharsis after watching the movie. Don't get me wrong, the third act is fun and even Neytiri herself goes full-Rambo-mode here, I enjoyed it immensely, but the events leading up to it seemed generic to me, and from the script, I really feel that it is outdated in terms of originality and innovation. We've seen this before and I understand that the visual side has moved on and that Avatar got a sequel, but this type of scenario can no longer work at the top level. Jake and his family are in danger, and Quaritch threatens to kill the descendants in one piece, the least interesting of them, Neteyam, dies at the end, and after Jake vs. Quaritch wins Jake. Great, but Spider saves Quaritch and we get him in the top three?! I needed something more. Quaritch is a black-and-white villain who logically came back, but here Cameron should have killed him, which makes the movie feel slightly anti-climactic and unnecessary. And why Spider saved him at the end makes a bit of sense, he's his father, and blah blah, but it absolutely doesn't work for the movie. The resulting experience was still extremely positive and I'm really looking forward to the third, but I won't forgive Cameron there. He knows, how to shot a movie with such quality and create new technologies whenever he wants, but the pen has probably stopped writing properly on paper, it needs to be replaced quickly because I also want a luxurious story in such a luxurious coat. Otherwise, the idea of another tribe is great and I'm glad that I want to learn more about that world. Lo'ak grew on me and I hope he gets the most space from the children in the next films (and replaces Jake?). But what concerns the action scenes, the camera, the shooting, the pace - there Cameron is still different. In these ways, it is the king and will remain the king, but again - I want a better story. But I'm still glad I saw the movie in 3D, even though I felt a bit like the edges of the screen were darkened by my glasses, which created the effect of making the screen feel smaller. By that I mean, feel free to go for 3D, it's great, but I don't think you can go wrong with 2D. I'm looking forward to it anyway, these are movie events that are still saving cinemas, so all credit to Cameron. It doesn't shoot much, but when it does, everyone goes to it. Just don't let the paper rustle like that next time."
"Watch this in 3D theater. If there was any reason to see the technology, this movie is it. The 3D glasses look like sunglasses nowadays.The story is about the sea people that the family had taken refuge in. Underwater animals and plants are stunning visually. There is a mini love story with the new characters. Obviously, the key story is about one of the kids.Cameron is known to have violent fights in his movie, and there are plenty here. Stylized fighting scenes are how I would describe it.Three hours plus is a tad long. He could have shorten it to under three, but Cameron does what he does. There will be Part 3 soon."
"I want to start by saying what on earth are people talking about when giving this a bad review?!!Make no mistake, this is another masterpiece by Cameron. Basically if you liked the first, you'll love this.I have no idea how anyone could dislike this film. It flew over for a 3 hour 15 movie, and that was with an 8 year old with me in the cinema.We went as a family and all of us loved it. The pacing, the action, the story, the characters, the drama, the visuals!!! Everything about this film was superb. There was a slight lull in the middle (I can't remember where) but nothing that lasted, and everything seemed to pick up again without hesitation.A brilliant film which started amazingly, progressed well in the middle, then ended spectacular.Cannot recommend enough."
"James Cameron reemerges from the depths of his mind to expand our understanding of Pandora and it's cultures. The Way of Water knows why we love Avatar and deepens the lore of Pandora. Like Avatar (2009), The Way of Water tells an unoriginal story in a solid way and in doing so, provides a framework for absolutely mind-blowing visuals to give life to the Na'vi and Eywa. Pandora is the protagonist and Cameron clearly agrees. If you didn't like the plot of the original, you won't find much redemption here but if you want to learn more about this world, you'll get your money's worth. Watching it in 3D finally made me realize what I missed out on in 2009. I can now unequivocally confirm that if you haven't seen The Way of Water in 3D, you haven't seen the film."
"When my friends told me to go and watch it in the cinema I didn't want to because the first avatar movie wasn't my type of movie and I didn't like it , but ended up going anyways. The first hour was ok but after that I got bored and wasn't interested in the plot anymore. After the intermission I decided I was going to wait for the movie to finish in the entrance of the cinema because of how uninterested i was. As i am writing this I am waiting in the entrance of the cinema. The graphics are absolutely amazing but I think there is too much movement for my liking. Although that is just my preference . I think that 3hrs and 10 minutes is way too much for a movie and is part of the reason I got bored."
"When i say the movie is missing a lot of polish obviously not that much in the 3D department, that was of course fine.The story flow wasn't great, easily an hour of the movie could have been cut to make the story flow better. It's filled with way too much pure eye candy shots and tired tropes about family and bullies and being outcasts/freaks.I couldn't help but roll my eyes at these tropes. Its a trap too many film makers fall into: We are in a extra ordinary setting on a different planet and we fall back into covering social drama and not even smart social drama, but very generic one.Another small aspect was that much of felt like a cutscene from a video game. Camera movement was just too smooth, it felt very unnatural from following characters in third person to really hard zooms that started and stopped abruptly.At this point should i watch this movie again i know i will skip quite a bit of it."
"Unpopular opinion: Without even talking about the problems surrounding a rich old white guy trying to tell a story about colonialism and the attempted genocide of Indigenous peoples, I found this movie to be straight up BORING and so very tedious. So much so, that even the visual effects didn't really impress me. Sure, they were objectively stunning, but there was very little in the story or the characters to engage or connect me with the setting. As other commenters have said, I was shocked that this was over a decade in the making.A waste of time and money. A big ol' *thhbbbbbtttt* from me."
"Special Effects don't make automatically make a good movie.It Looked incredible but the story was so boring, and the characters felt two dimensional which is ironic.Unfortunately the run time is so long it really gets tiring, potential good performances from the cast feel less important than certain shots being made.There is too much focus on revolving a scene around certain things being shown than, rather than giving the main characters time to build on relationships, which is weird considering how long the movie is!No doubt this will be good for improving vfx for future films but why are we valuing films like this over well made, character developing movies with great stories...?"
"I watched the first one three times. It was so immersing. This one was far from that, I would never want to see it again.Sometimes the CGI was so disappointing, I see better quality in games I play on my PC with a 5 years old graphic card. (GTX1080).On the other hand, sometimes the exaggerated sharpness stole the cinema feeling. It didn't help you in immersing into the buzz of the story, it was alienating you instead. Sometimes the camera-handling, (too many yanking of the camera that supposed to give the feeling of being present on site - but failed doing that) and sharpness of the picture gave the feeling of a cheap TV program with the lowest possible budget. Movie makers should refuse to use this technology, it is a bad direction to go. (It was the worst in the latter parts of the movie.)
The movie also had some parts where it was just foolishly unreal in physics: like when the boats were bouncing on waves, and the actors in them were almost steady.The creatures in the movie sometimes seemed ""too much"". It was like when someone with a bad taste uses the full spectrum of opportunities in MS PowerPoint in a single presentation. For example, why those big sea creatures should have a bigger and a smaller eye? Only because it seemed a good idea to the visual designer. If there is something that has such a role in the visual universe of the movie, that should be explained, should have a reason to be there, I think.I wasn't sure about the actor who played Spider. Sometimes it seemed very bad acting, sometimes quite good.And finally: by the end of the movie it was obvious, the ""way of water"" means much more that it meant in the story: movies this long need a bathroom break, because it was painful to be there this long without it."
"You know these movies called Fast and The Furious - they're supposed to be about cars but aren't really about cars anymore?Yeah now you can add Avatar to that list.So. Much. Action. I mean, every freaking minute there's an explosion or someone shooting/killing somebody. And what's with the 30 minutes whale hunting scene? And let's not talk about that arm scene abomination.Where is the magic? Where is the love for the people, the culture, Mother Nature? So Jake is fighting with thousands of clans in the first movie to protect his people, his land but just leaves in the first 10 minutes of the second movie ""to protect his family""?Don't get me wrong, the visuals are out of this world. It's just sad that a movie like Avatar needs so much action, war, schootings and explosions to stay relevant."
"Same exact story as the original Avatar. Same soundtrack, Same soundtracks in same scenes as original avatar.I'm a huge fan of the original Avatar however this was so uncomfortable to watch that i walked out to complain to someone several times.I did not feel connected to the Navi fish people at all. The Navi acted way more primitive and savage. And what's with the human boy with the Navi people thing? James Cameron's version of Tarzan?The amount of Navi hisses in the movie is ridiculous. And the corporal coming back in an Avatar body? Maybe the story line employees need to reflect a bit and go back to explain why the military chose his consciousness to come back and get Jake Sully's kids?Also, the military looked ridiculous and over-dramatic with destroying everything. Cue camera zooms into beautiful looking tree being run over by a big scary truck."
My wife and stepson (34) and I went o see it at a theater here in Bogota. They (wife) messed up because I knew the effects would be superb in 3D and they only booked 2D to my chagrin. Still the visuals were amazing even beyond the original Avatar which 13 years lapse should get. We all loved the story but our son said it was sad those people got treated so badly. I m an Optimist and said look they beat the bad guys with few losses and letting the bad guy get away and statement that we shall unite to strike back clearly leads to a 3rd Avatar with heavy action. The mystical parts of this one were interesting and subtle till applied raising questions of how much more will be revealed in the next one? I WILL TAKE MY WIFE TO SEE IT AGAIN IN 3D and know it will be a whole another experience!!
When I saw this movie felt like I was in the movie beacuse of the visuals. This is movie is a visual treat and we some lots of things to experience in this movie.The story of the movie is a familiar one and it's based on family.The world Pandora it's amazing in Avatar First we experienced the forest and Land then in Avatar way of water it's world sea life.James Cameron has successfully treated me with visuals of a mysterious world with a eye catching visual. I felt like I was in heaven. The magical visual elements is the soul of this movie.The story line is familiar but something bigger will be there in coming parts of this movie.
"Needless to say Excellent CGI and visual effects. It was so realistic even with the poor 3D glass in theater. But, the movie was so lengthy and in some moments, it felt sleepy.The main problem in the story was it was not so engaging like the first one. The whole movie seemed about a documentary and lifestyle of Pandora animals in Geography Channel. The beauty of Pandora, struggle and survival instinct of the people all was their but couldn't collaborated properly. Some part of the movie felt unnecessarily long. It was so pathetic to see the selfish nature of Jake for his family. The final 30-40 minutes was so good but one sequence felt like Mr. Cameron's remake of Titanic.Overall, it was mostly good for the visuals with a flawed storyline."
"I watched it in IMAX 3D, and that's the only way I would watch this movie and you should too. Otherwise, you'd be disappointed. As many pointed out, the story is not really much. A big plot hole is that the water people suddenly disappeared in the middle of a war and abandoned their daughter.One big reason I want to watch this movie is that I love ocean and aquarium. It's $40 to visit Georgia aquarium and it took me just one hour to finish all. So for about $23 for the visually stunning movie depicts all those magical creatures in the ocean, this is worth every single penny. It's 3 hours long but I totally enjoyed and would recommend it to everyone, but again, IMAX, 3D."
"Given the nearly unlimited resources that would include, presumably, access to all manner of talented writers, Avatar 2's underdeveloped story and script is inexplicable unless it were the product of a high school assignment, in which case it would deserve a solid B; or if it were created by an AI script-writing program not able to appreciate human relationships, emotions or thoughts beyond broad strokes. That it's a movie with its political and moral values clearly and passionately expressed is, of course, not the problem. Whereas most CGI productions might offer an occasional ineffectual and disingenuous whisper of a moral view in between this or that deafening bombast, who would argue against Mr. Cameron's messages espousing family loyalty and regard for others who are different (species, tribes, perspectives) as opportunities to embrace and learn, vs otherness to destroy? Thus, Avatar 2's problem is not an absence of morality or interest regarding big and important problems of human nature but the simplistic story development and, at its core, implausible and one-dimensional characters. Portrayals of supposed character growth ring not just false but nearly random, and silly. In my audience, there were a few scenes that, unintentionally, elicited blurts of laughter--along with an audible ""really?"" once or twice. In the end, Avatar 2 was beautiful to behold but felt manipulative, patronizing and boring. And too painful."
"No new history. Scenario is a copy of 1 part but in a new beautiful scenery.There is a lot of unnessesary cruelty and agression.Second half of a movie is holding watcher in stress until the end. This is very uncomfortable and has nothing from beauty of Avatar part one.Movie story has got no sense and at the end really nothing changes and nothing is solved.Story is really about nothing.It is the same old scenario: someone wants a revenge, someone is running away the whole movie, big fight, thats it.I expected a lot more from this part after seeing wonderful Avatar 1.I feel sad, bitter and dissapointed.I wouldnt recomend this movie.So reassuming.Special effects and graphic design is amazing.Story is boring.Agression on this level and intensiveness is really dissapointing, tireing and unnessesary."
"This sequel has really stunning CGI, and I would recommend watching it for this. The pandora alien world was well made and designed.However, the story is generic (revenge/greed/exploitation) and disney-like (family, spiritual, animal relationship/communication, clans). There is nothing fresh in the story telling, just enough excuse to showcase the stunning CGI. It is very focussed on the Pandora beings and the hybrids and their spirituality to their environment, rather than the humans and their futuristic technologies and exploration.As the sequel goes deeper in exploring Pandora, it is more like watching an animation movie than a sci-fi epic film. More family based like Lost In Space and religious/mystic rather than sci-fi.Depending on your expectations and genre preference, you might really like the direction Avatar series is heading, or you might find fall flat. For me, the movie was just MEH."
"It has been a really long time that I have considered walking out of a movie. There are stunning scenes and it is well acted, but... - where is the story? And what story there is: what is different to Avatar, part 1??? Great creatures and scenery, but do we really need 2 hours of fighting and conflict...and pretty much more of the same? I don't think I will be back for parts 3, 4 and so on!And something really minor: what is it wit the director and water - Abyss and Titanic send their greetings; and if it is about quality of sequels can we talk Terminator (parts 1 and 2)?So if we want to see a remake, let's go for Top Gun, but not this waste of time and money."
"Special effects, 9 out of 10; storyline, 2 out of 10.Boring, predictable and preposterous.I find that, during and after the pandemic, many films have been made that seem to cater to our fragile egos, wanting to fuel our delusion that the world is black and white, good is good and bad is bad, and that we are always on the side of good.This is one of them.Full of inconsistencies, the story-line is to say the least, pathetic. The dialogues are trite and mawkishly sentimental (who actually speaks like that?) and from the very first scene you can rightly guess everything that is going to happen.This movie has been made for profit alone.Don't let them manipulate you: spend your money somewhere more deserving."
What a wonderful way to spend over 3 hours. Got my first viewing at the new IMAX cinema and a fresh pair of 3D glasses. Chose the best seats with direct Line of sight to the screen. Loved how the storey at the beginning told you about their life leading up to present and the new family dynamics. Saw the first avatar 5 times in 3D so hopefully will try and see this one just as many times. The under water scenes were mesmerising with the animal creations and the ocean waves and under water life. I loved how the storey delved into pandora's mother Ewa and how everything is linked. Can't wait for the next movies and the team from Weta did an amazing job and James Cameron really bought us his storey.
"I am a massive avatar fan, loved the first and been eagerly awaiting the sequel and it didn't disappoint. Firstly, the biggest thing once again with avatar way of water is the beauty of pandora, the forest was an amazing setting 13 years ago but I just wanted them in the sea for this 1. After the first 30 minutes we switch to the sea and that's when this films beauty and class filming really goes up a notch.I found the story interesting and despite there being a lot of characters, I liked most of them and was invested with their them.The film is over 3 hours in length but went by quickly. I recommend watching this at cinema in 3d and if like me, you are a fan of the first, I am sure you will love this. Would recommend this film to anyway, was amazing."
"Another movie that would be much better without a sequel.Really disappointed with this movie because it's a copy of the previous one but with different animals and environment.They still tried to introduce some new features, such as children and the villain like Avatar, but it was insufficient to reach the level of the first film.I don't have much more to say about the film, other than that I won't see it again, for sure, unlike the previous one, which I've already seen several times. It's a shame and I hope that if they have the courage to make the third one, they'll find a script worthy of a film of this dimension, although I understand that it won't be easy."
"Good sequel to the first part when it comes to visialisation. And that's it. Basically, nothing new. 3D and other visual effects we have already seen. The plot is kind of empty. Something is missing, the movie didn't touch me. At only one point it managed to shake me a bit. At most of the movie I asked myself WHY are they doing it like this. Couldn't catch the reason for the steps characters are taking. Not because it is not expected, but because it makes no sense. To me personally it looked like someone was tasked to make script and he didn't watch first part. If I write more it will contain spoilers so I won't go further, but honestly, I should have waited for HBO to show it in 2 years, wouldn't miss a thing. I don't know if Cameron already prepares another sequel, it can goes like this for numerous repetitions, but I really doubt that, when it comes to the story, anything new can be added."
"Didn't make sense, the birth and childhood of their children just 2 minutes. And staying in other villages unnecessary 1 hour. So lengthy and exhausting. Nothing as we compare it with the 1st one. Jake was hero but made him coward. As a king he needed to be there to save his people but he was selfish as a result he lost his son. Introduced the villain so early without building the story. Last fight was boring too. Expectation was high as a result disappointment is high . Considering it as an overrated movie but CGI was great. I missed the charm and emotion of the 1st one.But the 2nd child is always deal breaker that one is realistic."
"First, let me start with the fact that the sequel to the cult first part must be seen in IMAX, I repeat must!After watching it in IMAX and coming home in the evening, I couldn't sleep for more than three hours because of the adrenaline rush!It's rare that I've enjoyed a sequel to a cult blockbuster so much more.I don't know how the movie was filmed, but watching it in IMAX it seems like you're watching something live through a huge window.The effects and ideas in the film have no comparison with anything that has been done so far in the cinema.If I had to describe the continuation of Avatar in two words, it would be - Rebirth of cinema !"
"James Cameron strikes again, and it was definitely worth the long wait. This is HANDS DOWN easily the peak EPITOME of this generation's CGI!! Truly nothing comes close to this. Absolutely nailed the visuals in every way possible!! All hail the lord Weta Digital for nailing every possible bit of the CGI. And that adaptive 48FPS of the movie really dances buttery smooth with the brain cells. It keeps on switching back and forth between 24FPS and 48FPS, and truly makes the whole theatre experience worthy. Even though the runtime was pretty big, all that story and action justifies it, and we all dig it. Cannot wait for the sequel now!!"
"I just watched the movie and I loved it but I found the start more like a video game where you are playing a character in first person and quality was really good but I disliked the Colonel in avatar form and how he went from being created to suddenly attacking Pandora, I wished he'd have loved the place rather than attack the place and also Neytiri's younger son didn't need to die. I enjoyed the movie though but just found the start more of a video game and completely different to the first one and also sad that there weren't more of the people from the forest in Pandora, would sort of recommend it but it's completely different also now we know there will probably have a third one with Colonel still alive."
"This new movie looked more crisp and cleaner than I remembered the first movie to be, which was already the best 3D movie at its time. Small nitpicking is that the fires in the movie looked very artificial. The movie is pretty long with over 3 hours run-time, but honestly, it didn't feel like that and there was no reason to feel bored. The weakest part is again the script, which is far from being original and having had 5 authors named for it surely didn't help. Also borderline pesky was Sam Worthington rambling on and on about family values with a lot of repeat. The movie paints again the story of greedy corprorates invading a paradise like moon. The movie itself is not a big concluding movie, but preparing for the next movies coming after it."
"Technical aspect: Clearest (crystal clear) and best 3D scenes i have ever seen. 3 hours full of jawdropping moments. I'm still totaly speechless. Especially the waterbased scenes (lot of em) are stunning. Soundeffects amazing as well. To be honest, i was disappointed by the score.Story : it was ok, but not as good as Avatar 1. It felt not like a whole movie, more like a part of a bigger one. We will see how it fits along the upcoming Avatar movies. But according to James Cameron it depends on how much Avatar 2 will bring in at box office. Let's hope enough to see the other ones.Give it a chance. You will enjoy it."
"Where can I start , is it the perfect water photos, well assembled characters, the passion. Every thing about this film screams perfection. Cameron has made another blockbuster maybe even surpasses it's predecessor in a long way. This film is made for the Cinemas and for 3D IMAX experience. It's a movie that will keep you at the edge of your seats and keep you glued there for hours. It's run time is long but that's the only way this masterpiece of a story can be told. You feel the emotion of the characters, you get to appreciate their oneness with nature. Everything character resonates with the world around them. It's definitely a MUST watch film, I hope it surpasses the 3B mark set by Avatar 1 cause that's the only way it gets justice. Cameron is a true God of Cinema."
"Visually, the film is great and it is definitely a fantastic experience to dive into the world of Pandora. But unfortunately, the film doesn't want to be a marine documentary or an educational film about underwater animation, but a blockbuster that wants to tell us a story. This story is so bad and lazy that I was really horrified. Especially considering that they had 13 years to write a good screenplay. Even without the prequel, the plot would have been bad, but the fact that it is additionally identical to the plot from part 1 really shocked me. Just saying ""Hey look, I can show you the best underwater animations!"" is just not enough in my opinion for a sequel to the most successful movie of all time."
"This is basically the same story we have been watching since Star Wars. Lovely family scenes preyed on by US/western style military might. Coupled with 121 alpha male v alpha male fights in the name of kids. Designed to tug your emotions with kid induced peril and cgi scenes reminiscent of serious war crimes such as children held as hostages. Really?! You couldn't write more emotionally awful scenes, and so many. Babies, children, and even pregnant whale like creatures attacked and some destroyed by military hardware of the worst kind. Maybe there was a positive if people better understand how the whaling industry work! The problem comes when we lose empathy for real war from watching this stuff. Do we need children to see this to train them for a future world? Directors need to be more responsible. This film adds nothing positive to the world and more likely does untold harm. Find a new story, and 12a is ridiculously low for this film. 15 at least."
"So Long and Big disappointing. After 13 years I thought it will be good but I was so bored.It was 3 hours I will never get back haha.If you didn't watch it yet do Yourself a favor and don't watch it.Maybe watching it at home to fall asleep with it is ok but at the cinema, it will be like a punishment.Not worth the money or the time.Was not fun and I fall asleep too many times.Shame and blame Disney for not giving it more life or making it shorter.I hope some people will read this and change their minds.One mistake I did, I didn't read the reviews before I go to watch it myself."
I watched the movie in 3D and.enjoyed.the story.way more than the first and even moreb than Titanic. I love the antagonist VS protagonist.not.expecting that who they.portrayed. The avatar characters created were non traditional too andthere was element of love.story m The.specialfx were mindblowing and stunning amazing scenes. I got very emotional by watching some of the nature scenes. I was more riveted to the story over the 1st and later on learned how the.film got its title. James loves a lot of action and he delivered very well in this.area. I would recommend you take family as I think they would enjoy it!
"When it came in 2009, it presented a new story to the world with marvelous visuals which were ahead of its time.Since then many movies and documentaries have been made with some similar topic and fight scens so naturally our hopes have raised to to expect more from this sequel.And this time, they had to be either better than the first part, or just be an average movie with big bucks used in production.And they did it.This is way better in every aspect than the first part. And the most important part is the visuals. The visuals are ""fantastic, fabulous, fascinating, freaking awesome"". James has given his best here, like I said each frame could be my desktop wallpaper.The sound design is pure and awesome but I think they still needed to come up with some ""more complicated and hard"" storyline with more emotions within it. The story seems to be more simple and there are little to no twist. But still I am not blaming it, this is what I would like to see."
"Absolutely beautiful and aesthetically stunning cinematic presentation, however the story felt very one dimensional and regurgitated from first movie (plus others - Dances with Wolves, Last Samurai, FernGully, Avatar 1 etc).We could acknowledge and overlook James Cameron's nods to previous blockbusters (ie. Titanic, Alien) but not to the extent it can be forgiven for the lack lustre storyline and 1.5 hr swimming lesson.If you're looking for a fun, visually enjoyable movie to watch at the cinemas Avatar 2 shouldn't be missed. So grab your popcorn, forget the story line, bind with your Ikran and enjoy the ride !"
"The actions scenes alone were well worth the movie. The attention to detail and visual effects are unmatched by any action movie. It really makes you think that Marvel movies are slacking hard in that department.The movie does take time to build but you have to put in a little work to enjoy the ending more if you ask me. If you're a little ADD, you might have trouble appreciating the plot.Again, I could not believe some of these action scenes! They were out of this world and pretty violent in the best kind of way.The genuine hard work and perfectionism that went into this film is very hard to come by and is genuinely appreciated. This franchise has potential to be the most successful and masterful."
"I will start with what was good: The visuals. The underwater scenes were quite amazing, the action scenes were realistic, pretty mesmerizing environment overall.Everything else was quite bad. The plot is almost the exact same as the first movie. Humans against the Na'vi. Even the villain that got killed in the first film, comes back again but then as his clone (seriously?). And for some reason, his only ambition is to find Jake Sully - nothing else.Ultimately, just like in the previous movie, the final scenes are a decisive war between humans vs. The Na'vi, except this time the humans only have a bunch of battleships and seem to get beaten rather easily. Could they not have come up with a more different plot this time?The dialogue was corny, with the Na'vi children repeating the word ""bro"" and ""cuz"" (slang for cousin), unfunny jokes, bad cliches (like the Australian guys who made those dumb jokes even when about to die), rushed story on how or why they were there (supposedly humans arrived because Earth was becoming uninhabitable but also to extract this anti-aging liquid from whales - what?).Overall, not worth the watch. Far too long of a movie to bear with the terrible plot and corny dialogue."
"""I See You"" The Way of Water, wow just wow. If you're on the fence and perhaps not quite sure if it's worth going to theaters to view one of the most visually spectacular modern pieces of Cinema to ever grace your eyes thereby sending the euphoric images straight back into your visual cortex, and before you know it three hours and 15 minutes is up and you're only left wanting more and more. It's the first time in my 50 years I have ever become addicted to a movie other than a Kurosawa film.. It's been a very long time since I was able to enjoy a good movie in modern times because it seems like cinema nowadays is required to push the message in each and every cookie cutter horribly written movie nowadays.I had absolutely no expectations when going to the early premiere of James Cameron's Magnus opus Avatar ll, just as I had back in 2009 with the original when I took the whole family, my middle child was eight back then, little dude loved the original so damn much at the time, we viewed it together nine more freaking times in theaters. As fortune would have it, I was able to reunite the fam to see this this stunningly brilliant masterpiece. My son is now rd 22 years old and very cynical on modern Cinema, he tells me all the time "" it's almost all junk nowadays,"" and ""why can't they just make a well written movie instead of pushing an agenda?!"" or ""it's all pretty much garbage dad,"" the last five movies we seen with the exclusion of maverick, big Dude absolutely despise most modern Cinema, he said, thankfully, a new avatar is damn near perfect, and not once was this film trying to push the message.""Carpe Diem."
"I stopped going to cinemas about 10 years ago, and the last movie I watched more than once in a theater was Avatar 2009. I even stopped watching any movie more than once. But this one ooohhh I've seen it 4 times already in 3 weeks and I still want to watch it again!Everytime I watch it I get transported to Pandora and it's worth every second and penny. No other movie gives me these feelings. Everytime I care more about the characters and I enjoy it more.The first time I was a bit disappointed about it for not having a more complicated plot but then I realized it doesn't need a more complicated story, because that would make it more difficult to just let go and enjoy Pandora's flora and fauna. And yet the story is complex enough. Come on, an entire alien planet full of intelligent species and then their conflict with stupid greedy entitled humans.I'm so tired of human movies. They're all the same. So tiring. I wish there were more films full of imagination with intelligent civilizations living in their home planets and with their own issues way way different than humans in all aspects. I'm tired of horror sci-fi without any science and lots of blood. Tired of apocalyptic movies full of blood. I won't even mention the dumb superhero capitalist films or romcoms. I guess I did. Sorry for the rant.Back to Avatar, AMAZING! I've watched it 4 times and I'll watch it a few dozen times more if I can.Sorry for any typos or mistakes, English is my 3rd language. Peace."
"Never have I seen a movie with such a high ""cliché per minute"" count. It is truly astonishing.The plot is more suited for a matinee western from 1952. Except for all the gaping holes.It is unbelievably cringe. Tedious beyond belief.It is pretty though. But that is not enough to sustain a 3½ hour movie. I honestly had a hard time keeping my eyes open, it was so boring.One good thing I can say about it is that it doesn't follow the current trend among blockbusters and try to make the women seem strong by making the men incompetent clods. Both male and female characters have agency in the story. I actually find it astonishing that that is something that is worth pointing out. But these are the times we live in."
"The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is the character of Kiri, who was interesting and I was hoping the story would build up around her a bit more.But then again, the story in this movie is so simple, uninteresting, recycled from the previous movie and without a single interesting plot twist. It is as if the filmmakers said: ""here's your sequel to the movie you liked so much. It is more of the same, hope you enjoy it."" A good part of the movie looks like an SF documentary. When I want something like that, I watch real documentaries.The visuals did not do it for me. CGI upon CGI for a completely unnatural feel. The music is not as good as in the first one. The idea that the main villain is back in a new body is bad writing, almost like Palpatine returning in the new Star Wars. Jake not making sure he is very dead at the end after loosing a son (we all know villains aren't dead if they just kinda sink with their heads still attached to their bodies) is very unconvincing. As a whole, the movie is very unconvincing.Then there are the Titanic sceenes. My gosh. My wife and I couldn't believe what we were seeing. You know how Disney used to recycle the same sceenes with different characters (like dancing sceens, for instance)? Well, this felt like that.All in all, it's 3 hours forever lost. I am happy that a lot of people liked the movie, but for me, it was a total miss."
"After 13 years the sequel to one of the all time best movies I ever saw Is finally here. James Cameron had perfected the cgi in Pandora's jungle. In the ocean? Yep. In the cgi ocean of Avatar 2 is next level mesmerizing with good story. The characters are all great, when I saw Avatar 2 with my sister in cinema my sister fell in love with Lo'ak (one of Jake and Neytiri's kids). Kiri is a cute character, but my favorite character of this movie is Spider. Spider is the most fun character of the whole film, I love him and he kinda reminds me one of my classmates who is a cool teenager like Spider is. The villain is back on his Na'vi form and he is surprisingly much menacing than ever.It's hard to choose between the first film and which is better, Avatar 2 is better in some ways. It's the second best film of the year behind ""The Batman"".9.5/10."
"Jake Sully is living on Pandora with his family until a threat from Colonel Quartitch puts him and his family in danger. The visuals in this film are stunning and even more spectacular than the first film. The story is very engaging and has interesting themes of imperialism, racism and family at the heart of it. The cinema experience on the biggest screen you can find is what I would recommend. I really loved the characters, the score and the cinematography in the film. There many wow moments in the film and moments that will get audiences cheering in their seats. James Cameron has done a spectacular job with this film. I think it is one of the best films of the year."
"Avatar: The Way of Water seems to confirm a particular trait about James Cameron that's been showing for a while - the director seems to be stuck in the 80s and 90s mentality and that's what this movie is - a mid to late 90s-like film with 2022 CGI.The characters are all really good or really evil and extremely unidimensional (which is usually the case with Cameron's work); it's ridiculous that the teenager Na'vi characters all behave like 90s american high scoolers; apparently growing up in the middle of nature, and around concepts of respect and spirituality did nothing for them - these are your typical high schoolers and behaviourally they differ nothing from the humans (which is nonsensical as the Na'vi should be way more consciously evolved than this - that's what was so forcibly established in the first film anyway). We're speaking about alien characters that use the word 'bro', 'dumbass', 'freak', etc. In fact, the whole dialogue is atrocious.Sigourney Weaver is a screen legend but unfortunately her casting choice as a 14 year Na'vi girl just doesn't work, voice wise at least - the character just sounds like a senior person. Winslet gives the standout performance but this shouldn't have been the film that reunited her with her Titanic maestro - she's barely given anything to do and her character isn't at all memorable; I somehow don't see Leonardo DiCaprio doing the same for Cameron for a unmemorable supporting role. The young performer that plays the Tarzan/Mowgli like character is wrongfully cast as he is just annoying and there isn't absolutely anything about him that screams that he grew up amongst these very evolved beings (his costume alone and overall look almost look like a caricature).Good luck watching the sleep enducing first hour; the rest is at least a bit more interesting although it's a 3h12m movie where basically nothing important or significant happens plotwise. There's barely any story at hand here and the film shifts main characters all the time: first we think its Sully, then his son (whatever his name is), then his daughter, then Sully again etc. Some things don't even make much sense - although they are living in an alien planet where the natives use their tails to communicate with other living beings, at some point the human characters assess that one of the Na'vi is experiencing some sort of psichotic episode or schizophrenia because she says that she feels she is communicating with a tree or whatever which for them for some reason sounds ludicrous. The characterisation of some of the characters can verge from good to plain ridiculous - the water tribe looks fantastic but the villains as Na'vi look stupid (one wears shades and another pops a bubblegum for example). Cameron seems to have a hard-on for these sort of 80s american war-hero like scenarios and he definitely shows it towards the ending battle with all the military vehicles and overall stereotypes.Even visually the movie isn't that incredible - I mean the CGI looks mostly great but it takes a while for you to accept it completely and immerse yourself in it (some backdrops look like matte paintings and the overal imagery doesn't look that more polished than AAA videogame CGI cutscenes). The 3D isn't a novelty anymore and, as such, it skips the wow factor which is what made the first movie immensely profitable anyway. There isn't anything particularly original or outstanding about the visuals and it just uses the same tricks as usual: clouds or grey skies for climatic battles, bioluminescence for spiritually, blue skies for peace and happiness, etc.It's a shame that after beautiful, big spetacle and envolving films like Dune: Part I, Blade Runner 2047, Gravity and the new Planet of the Apes films to name a few over the last decade, James Cameron takes 13 years to present us with this: a very long film that has nothing to say and is ridden with 90s clichés."
"At its heart, The Way of the Water is about the indominable strength of a family's will. Jake Sully does everything in this film in service of his family, even when questioned by Naeytiri. Even having been integrated into the Na'vi culture for over ten years, Sully pushes back against the culture and traditions, to Neytiri's anger and dismay. In an era where sequels have to mean bigger, because bigger means better, the common pitfall is adding in explosions and more characters to either kill or be killed, and while there is some of that here in this film, Cameron still keeps his focus narrow. For all its bluster, it's digital wonderance, and bloated runtime, The Way of the Water is simply a tale of a man who wants to keep his loved ones safe.That said, while Cameron and his team have created one of the great cinematic experiences of the year, the movie isn't without fault. From a writing perspective, Cameron may be at his weakest: Way of the Water's overall story isn't as strong or impactful as Avatar, the first act is a rough reintroduction to Pandora, and James Cameron, the man who made the idea of the space Marine so incredibly cool, fills these particular Marines with the cringiest, hammiest dialogue. Whether that's purposeful or not is certainly something to consider; in Aliens we get a squad of shit-talking, ass-kicking, overly macho (or overly compensating) characters who, while mostly one note and underdeveloped, are still memorable for their interactions with each other. Here in this movie, we get a gang of douchebags, simps to Colonel Quarich's petty quest for vengeance against Jake Sully. Whether or not Cameron is attempting to deconstruct the myth he himself helped create in Aliens is unclear. What's clear is his writing of their dialogue consists of little more than chuckling at Quaritch's evil schemes and telling hostages to hold still.The first 30-40 minutes of Way of the Water may be its roughest patch. The story is juggling reintroducing characters while giving appropriate due to the new faces in the franchise, attempting to simultaneously remind of you where things ended in Avatar, what's transpired over the past decade plus, and set up the new central conflict of the film (which, honestly, is just the exact same one from before, but this time it's personal). This leads to clunky editing, hopping between stories in an unwieldy fashion that feels more like an unsuccessful exposition dump than a setting of the board. Once the pieces are in play, however, the film settles into itself, and the audience can buckle in for a hell of a ride.Except, there's act two, which could be one of the most divisive elements of the film. Once the Sullys have left the skies and taken to the oceans, the narrative shift from Jake and Neytiri protecting the family to the Sully children learning to integrate into a new society and acclimate to the ocean becomes the story's main conceit. If the pacing of the first act is janky, the pacing of the second act almost slows to a halt. Not to say that's completely a negative, however, this is where Cameron relaxes and proceeds to flex on moviegoers with the reason the sequel took so long: the water scenes in this movie are amongst some of the most beautiful he's ever crafted. The entire act exists almost solely on vibes: lots of pondering shots filled with gorgeous digital landscapes and extended underwater sequences take full advantage of the 3D and IMAX screens, inviting those in the seats to come along the journey. Occasionally Cameron will remember to insert a bit of plot to keep the narrative thrust alive, but he also know where his strength lie with the first movie and that's in creating a world people would visit if it were possible. He replicates that feeling in the second act to astonishing results, at the detriment of the storytelling.The third act is pure, unadulterated, uncut raw James Cameron: pulse pounding action, small beats that further develop the characters, and spectacle as far as the eye can see. Overall, the film is a triumph, and while there's parts that don't work as well as others, and some characters that don't work well at all, the idiom that has been kicked around Hollywood for years continues to ring true in 2022: don't bet against James Cameron.Sam Worthington reprises his role as Jake Sully, physically damaged former Marine turned native in the first film. As the face of a franchise, Worthington is less than ideal; his lack of any sort of charm or charisma hampers the character from being beloved, but his talents are serviceable. Luckily, no one goes to an Avatar movie to see Sam Worthington, and what he does in this film is exactly what he did in the first; he hits his marks, he says his lines, and we proceed on to the next scene. While it's not necessary to be a ruggedly handsome man exuding waves of charisma to lead a franchise (it certainly helps, though), Worthington has never really fit the leading man type. Still, he provides enough to be passable and will likely continue to return to the role for as long as he's needed.Zoe Saldana has far less to do here than she did before. Previously, Saldana is Sully's (and the viewer's) guide into the Na'vi and their foreign ways. She's a necessary component needed for Sully's eventual transition, and by film's end the journey's she's taken to learning to trust humans again, or at least a handful of them, makes for a good character arc. In Way of the Water, Sully has been fully integrated into the culture for years, therefore diminishing her role as guide. This time around, Neytiri is a (mostly) supportive wife, relegated to spending large swaths of the movie either fearing for her children's safety or simply not on screen. It's the final showdown where Neytiri really gets her chance to shine and shine she does. Saldana, no stranger to action scenes, throws herself fully into the mix, with an outstanding fight scene that reminds moviegoers never to mess with a mother's children.Stephen Lang returns as Colonel Miles Quaritch, one of the better gleeful villains of past years. A cliche spewing, cigar chomping, walking ball of buzzcut testosterone in the first film, Lang is very obviously having a blast playing the film's central antagonist. He returns with the same attitude here, with a bit of a harder edge, determined to kill Jake Sully for his crimes against humanity. Quaritch is a gun-toting military enthusiast's wet dream, and while that type of person inherently comes with their own toxicity, the absolute joy with which Lang plays the character makes him one of my recent favorite villains. Thanks in large part to Cameron's writing and Lang's acting, Quaritch is a character that people can love to hate.While there's other characters introduced in the film, to include all of the Sully children, as well Cliff Curtis and Kate Winslet as ruling family of the reef people, and Spider, a character that doesn't quite fully work, the relationship between Jake Sully, Neytiri, and Quaritch really is the reason for the season. Even though Cameron laces the film with those themes of family togetherness and fighting for survival, it's the round two grudge match between the three that provides the thrust for the action in this large budget adventure. The movie's ending will guarantee something of a round three, possibly the final word on settling the score for good. Thanks to all three actors (mainly Lang and Saldana), the story is primed and the stage is set for a Rocky/Apollo Creed level matchup.Avatar: Way of the Water brings writer/director/producer James Cameron back to the director's seat, helming his first narrative feature since the Avatar 13 years prior. This go round Cameron chooses to focus on the family dynamic. In this, Cameron as a writer excels: the Sully family feels like a family almost any of us can relate to: rebellion teenagers, smaller children still encountering the wonders that Pandora holds, the outcast different child, all these elements are in play and Cameron uses these elements to set up a number of storylines and situations. From a directing standpoint, Cameron, cinematographer Russell Carpenter, and the rest of the cast flex their skills in recreating (and then enriching) the world that so many people fell in love with back in 2009. The attention to detail and the creature work is astounding, and even with a second act that drags the pacing of the entire film down, no fault can be blamed on the experience that Cameron wanted to convey; through both Lo'ak and Kiri the audience is able to enter another unturned stone of Pandora, its oceans. It took Weta FX a year and a half to develop a motion capture system that could blend with filming underwater; the result of their efforts is easily one of the best visual events of the year. These are the reasons Cameron took so long before filming the first movie and filming this one, it's clear that he wants the audience to feel as much as the characters of the story do and in this he succeeded in spades.Overall, while the stakes of Way of the Water aren't as high as its predecessor, the grandeur of storytelling is. James Cameron leaves it all on the screen, providing a visual and auditory experience that reminds moviegoers of the art of blockbuster."
"I've waited for this movie for 9 years, and I am not disappointed.First of all I actually love Quaritch. The first film he was crude, unapologetc, a typical hard head soldier who wants nothing more than to execute his task. The second film he comes back as an avatar, and is slightly nostalgic to Jake; cocky, has gained humor, and overall seems to have softer expressions than old Quaritch. It seems hes also trying to rival Jake especially going the hard way like Jake did with his banshee. Spider was a necessity in this film and I'm not having it otherwise (even if he did piss me off). He also opened another side to Quaritch, and I think opened him to the world of Pandora. Quaritch didn't seem overly entertained by the Tulkun hunt, and even hesitated killing the Na'vi. He wouldn't have done this in the past.Parallels. I found them very fascinating. The movement of the Sully family to the Metkayina tribe, and them having to learn new ways mimiced Jakes entry to the Omatikaya, Lo'ak being attacked in the water, but also how they dealt with the movement. Neytiri had already lost her home once, and the others had probably never moved before. Jake was being Jake as he had already experienced dislocation a few times. Music wise - the Eywa theme showed Kiri's connection just like it did with Jake, and you saw similar motifs which reminded me of the heartbreaking scenes of the first film and brought up those emotions. Also how Quaritch reacted with being in an avatar body like Jake did, Quaritch said he would need to ride Na'vi - and it shows how Jake and Quaritch had similar aims but then Jake broke off from Quaritch who stayed the same.Another parallel that I realised was during the Tulkun hunt you saw the marine biologist sort of mimiced Grace, however he was not as outspoken and Grace would definetly not have harmed animals in pursuit for knowledge - or at least of what we knew of. The hunter obviously mimiced Quaritch in his hunt for the Tulkun but was contrasted against Quaritch next to him (mentioned earlier)the little details: CGI improvement to the dots that reacted with emotions and Kiri with her connection with Eywa, the scene with Lo'ak and the Tulkun where his body mimiced the tail of the Tulkun, the bioluminescence in the water, Zoe's acting once Neteyam had passed absolutely killed me - but you could see all of them had no time to process the greif, and Neytiri transferred this into absolute anger which would be percieved as being savage. Their performance during that scene was impeccable. There are other details I love such as the ears reacting to sound/emotion etc, including their tailsI appreciate the scenes that may seem like fillers becasue it helps take you to the world of Pandora, I've seen criticisms about the Unobtanium being replaced by the Tulkun spit stuff and I sorta understand it but at the same time it reflects what the human race already does - can't get one thing, oh yea we will go onto another thing that harms the world just as much.Leaving the forest I'd say was a pretty damn good choice - it was a creative decision, but the RDA were already targeting the sea so ig it would eventually lead somewhere around that story wise
And the constant action, well there isnt? Theres like a 30min-1hr block of little action, and even to the very end for me it felt very short lived (not a complaint just an observation). I would say that in contrast to avatar there is little build up, but that's the nature of the story - it happens quickly. Its not like a tsunami slowly coming up over the horizon the threat is there and the RDA want it over quickly.Overall I forgot I was in the cinema watching it. I nearly turned up late and was prepared to leave even if I was one minute late bc I wanted to see it right as it started. I cant thank the whole team enough for providing this film, everyone did an amazing job. I kinda hope Quaritch eventually leaves the film or another threat or smth comes along, maybe even in the 5th it becomes more of an adventure less action. I cant wait to see where it goes and hopefully theyre jsut as good as this one."
"This movie may be over 3 hours, but it is wholly captivating and enthralling. The cinematography and breathtaking visuals make 3 hours feel like 3 minutes. To be clear, it is the sheer awe created by the scenery and action that drives this movie, and not the story. The story is predictable and definitely plays second fiddle to the world of pandora and it's people. The action scenes are fantastic and exciting. It may be because the actors are portrayed as aliens, but the acting definitely feels real, and I was drawn in by their emotions and communication. It's hard not to feel for the Navi and their biosphere. Overall, a groundbreaking movie that builds off the first in a meaningful way."
"I will first say special effects, A. I., sound, and imagery are all wonderfully designed. Yes the film is long, but the story kept me engaged the whole time and I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of the movie! It was very emotional witnessing the continuation of the Sully family saga. It is action-packed and a very heartwarming, emotional film. Would definitely recommend to everyone looking for a great film to watch! I would even put this up there with movie of the year. What a wonderful sequel to such an amazing movie! I absolutely cannot wait to see the third installment, if there is one in the future!"
"Well I love J. Cameron's movies but this will be the least of my favourite. Im kinda dissapointed for the story. It feels like much below average for his standard,frankly,I think he can do so muccchhh better and yet I dont know why. At the end of the movie,he still tend to bring alive the villain..and I really cant get it. It just feel like the Avatar 3 will actually same story,same villain in a different way...Well, in terms of Visual graphic or CGI I have to admit that it is perfect and evotionary,however, I have to be honest that I really really dissapointed wih the story. For 13 years long await,the way of water flush me out of it."
"It is as visually stunning as the first one and also narratively pretty similar. It is easy to anticipate the story which can make things a little bit boring. It felt like I was watching the same movie as Avatar 1, but it is happening on water instead of in the forest. 3 hours felt too long as I could not feel engaged with the story most of the time. Its a shame that such a visually immersive and brilliant world creation could not compensate the need of an equally great story telling. The last act of the movie was undeniably the best part which accommodates a whole hour of the reel time. So, those people who like complex story telling and emotional experiences, please hold your expectation."
"I saw this movie at a 4DX theater in 3D as well.Kids will love this movie. Full of action and beauty.As an adult, I appreciate actions and visuals, but more importantly, I appreciate quality writing and plots/storylines. You would think that over these 13 years Cameron would have developed a better story than this. I am absolutely disappointed. I probably will not return for Avatar 3 and 4.The 4DX was all over the place. The seats were not tuned to what was happening in the movie, just random moving and shaking.The 3D also blurred the film as expected and muted the colors just a hair.This is a standard, matinee movie at best. Don't pay a dollar more. Better yet, wait for it to come out on HBO Max or Disney+.So sorry to be so critical, but there's no excuse for this. Abysmal."
"The visual was obviously good, but the story is too weak and predictable, there are too many characters so some of them seem useless to the story, the only characters who are well-developed and compelling to me are Lo'ak and Kiri, those rare good moments in the movie involve them. Maybe it's just me, but honestly, in some places I didn't understand logically why what is happening happening. Also, it repeats the 1st movie too much.But my main complaint is that in the beginning the movie gives you very high stakes, but then it forgets all about it and in the end the stakes are only the main characters' lives, and those promised high stakes are left for the next movie. So that was disappointing."
"It's fantasy, and not meant to be sophisticated or thought provoking. I simply expected a fun film with empathetic protagonists.The plot was just average, the visuals were enjoyable, but I couldn't shake off so many moments throughout the film of toxic male chauvinism. Though the females fight, and at times you see the males looking to check that their partner approves of their decision, the male chauvinism in this film is hardcore; the males lead the tribes, the males are the only ones to speak on behalf of tribe and family, the males are the only ones to show any authority in the family or discipline the kids, and the only ones to come up with plans and strategies...seriously?!This is not the film's only flaw, but to me it colored the whole watching experience; as a woman, it really alienated me and prevented me from enjoying the movie as much as I could have."
Pandora world the beauty of the film & revisiting on big screens is amazing. But that's about it with this sequel.The story is about Jake Sully who tries to lay low and protect his family and community of Pandora from Colonel Quaritch. Colonel Quaritch who now has avatar body and mission to come after Jake Sully to destroy him.Sadly story execution is not done well. The length of the film is bit exhausting. The effects of the film is good but gives vibe of gameplay more than a film in today's time. Music and story highlights of the first film is used mostly which seems bit repetitive. RealD 3D isn't good. IMAX 3D is better if you like 3D films. Sadly film isn't projected in HDR or Dolby Vision.This film proved that James Cameron can't mimic what Peter Jackson or Christopher Nolan are able to do when it comes to creating trilogies.
"This movie was absolutely fantastic! The story was good the visuals were literally out of this world...I had the same feeling as I did with Avatar 1. I actually felt like I was on Pandora...These movies have so many hidden meanings inside. I've seen negative reviews on the story line. It wasn't as good as it could have been, however it's the message's that Cameron's trying to get across. We need to save our forests and oceans, this film highlights so many issues humanity has to face. We need to come together as one if we are to survive, and family/love/unity is everything, regardless of whoever you are.Overall this film is a wake up call like the first was, however now in a different perspective of water!Absolute masterpiece and indeed the film of the generation!"
"I expected so much more from James Cameron. The creative team had over a decade to deliver us a worthy sequel, and all they managed to do is deliver the same film we got in 2009. They recycled basically everything, including the plot and the main villain. If you are going to reuse the same villain, then they had better be an interesting villain, like Vader, instead we get one of the most unoriginal stereotypical villain trope characters... AGAIN.The sequel delivers trope after trope, even with the few new creative additions that the sequel adds, like the children, felt like recycled scenes we've seen in dozens of films before it. James Cameron has a pretty amazing body of work under his belt, but it felt like he put as little creativity into Avatar 2 as possible.That's not to say there were no positive things to the sequel. Like the original, the sequel is visually beautiful. And while the plot was basically recyled from the original, there were still touching moments, and the performances of the top-notch cast were well done, but unfortunately that was not enough for me and my friends to not notice how unoriginal it was. Normally, if a movie is good, I have no problem sitting through a 3+ hour film, but this movie definitely had me feeling all 3 hours and 15 minutes. Even the final battle scene of the final act played out EXACTLY how I imagined it would.Finally, (exactly) like the first film, there were many important messages about how we treat the environment, animal cruelty, racism, colonization, over-consumption/greed. But, to beat a dead horse, these same messages can also be found in many other films out there that the original Avatar was clearly inspired by in the first place. My advice: watch it at home, especially if you saw the original in theaters. It's basically the same movie."
"Absolutely not true.I am not the greatest fan of this notion. I didn't like the first film at all (though I don't quite recall the theater experience). I hated the paper thin characterizations, the vanilla plotline but mostly, the overuse of the abrupt crash zooms.The second installment significantly improves on most of the shortcomings and even provides the story with a lot more heart. However, there are still a few flaws (including the same amount of crash zooms, albeit they did look pretty cool on IMAX) but what most people aren't realizing is that this is just part of the whole story, the setup of you will.Overall, I really loved the film and pray that the sequels hold up (I do believe they need a comparatively stronger storyline to compensate for the lack of technological development of a large margin). I got completely lost in the world and wanted more when it ended, a lot more."
Visually stunning movie that leaves you awestruck without you even realizing. Movie is tad bit too long for my liking. Story line is weak but the mind blowing visuals make up for that. Highly recommend watching the first before watching the second as it references the first part throughout the movie. All actors did a great job in the film. Expected nothing but the best from James Cameron the man is ahead of its time. I loved it enjoyed it. An escape from reality! Can not wait for the 3rd and 4th. Hopefully it does not take another decade to release. What you waiting for go watch it now ! It is worth it !
"I absolutely loved the first Avatar and have been anxiously waiting for Avatar 2. I saw it in the theater yesterday and was very disappointed. I don't like being manipulated, and I felt that the screenwriting was lazy, taking shortcuts to advance the plot that led to behavior that simply wouldn't have happened. While the special effects and world building were beautiful, the heart of the first Avatar movie was its excellent story, the evolution of the characters and the realistic portrayal of how they might have reacted as the events unfolded. None of this was the case with Avatar 2. The characters were shallow and one-dimensional. And their behavior was not only irrational, but more importantly, inconsistent with their personalities.First problem: the humans arrive in ships and are allowed to build a military fortress for two years while the Na'vi sit and watch. After the horrible destruction that happened in their last encounter, why would they let them do that?? Jake knew this would happen. Why wouldn't he have anticipated their return and organized them to defend themselves. They had a decade to get ready. And even once the humans arrive, the Na'vi do NOTHING. With the invaders at their weakest, they should have organized a response. Instead, we're supposed to believe that the Na'vi just let them mine all the materials needed to build that sophisticated base and move people, equipment and supplies in unchallenged. THAT WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED!Second problem: do we really think that the best people to return to the planet are the very losers and mercenaries that antagonized the population in the first place? Do we, as humans, learn nothing from our mistakes, even at our worst?? Why bring back that bloodthirsty colonel, and to go so far as to bring him back from death? If they have his memories and knowledge on a memory stick, they could simply have taken the data and sent another leader who is not so burdened emotionally or despised so deeply by the Na'vi. And is it absolutely necessary to have one-dimensional characters whose only emotion is rage. At our worst, would humans really spend trillions of dollars on an expedition with such a person at the helm? With Earth in decline, humans would have sent their best and brightest. We would have learned a thing or two from the first disaster and course corrected.Third problem: When Jake Sully's avatar first landed in the jungle, we learned that he was but a baby in the woods, not knowing what to do or say and lucky to survive his first night out. It was only with training and support from the Na'vi that he was able to gain the strength and knowledge to navigate this world. The Na'vi survive in this world by working together. Yet we see that Colonel Quaritch is somehow an expert at surviving the environment on the first day out, with no training whatsoever. Jake had to spend months being mentored by Neytiri to acquire the strength, coordination and knowledge to be effective. Quaritch emerges that way from his incubation tube and soon after is able to subdue and bond with an impressive banchee.Fourth problem: Would Jake not have communicated to his kids that the biggest risk to their family and to his people would be that his children might be taken hostage? Of course he would have. He wouldn't have simply issued orders like they're little soldiers. He and Neytiri would have told them that they would move heaven and earth to keep them safe, and that falling in the hands of the Colonel would be the worst possible outcome for their people. We knew the kids would be taken hostage, not because it would have happened but because it was the most convenient tool for the screenwriters to create tension and move the plot. When I sense this in a movie I almost always walk out. Because of my love of the first Avatar I couldn't do that. But these kinds of inconsistencies left me with a bitter taste in my mouth, start to finish.Any one of these inconsistencies can be overlooked. But when there is one followed by another in quick succession, I feel the unwelcome presence of the screenwriter in the room, manipulating things so the story progresses in the direction they want.With all the money and time spent on this movie, they could have at least made the characters behave in ways that are believable. That's the easy part. A superstructure of sophisticated, costly and time-consuming animation should have been built on a solid storytelling foundation. With Avatar, we're invited into a beautiful and complex world with so many possibilities. The view of the water world was truly spectacular. And some of the subplots and characters are intriguing, inviting me to learn more. But after waiting 13 years on the edge of my seat for Avatar 2, I don't expect I'll be looking forward to the next installment with the same excitement. I hope Mr. Cameron does a better job on his next script."
"Saw this on the insistence of my husband and just to make him happy. Don't care about this movie or get the hype, nor did I care for the first one. It was way too long in my opinion, and has too much unnecessary fluff to it's story.This film was very slow to get off the ground, almost 2 hours before you get any kind of action/good writing. And I didn't really see anything spectacular here that wasn't seen 12 years ago, though my husband doesn't agree.I just don't understand what everyone sees in these films, they only remind me of the matrix. It's almost like they took the premise from there and added an alien type species.Unless you want to go to sleep I would not recommend wasting 3 hours of your life or the $45 on this, especially since the 3d effects will make you sick on top of that. I don't get how something this bad could cost so much to make, it's like they're trying to tank the franchise on purpose. Steer clear!"
"The visuals of this film made me stare at the cinema screen in wonder & awe. Combine this with a strong, classic action adventure story and engaging characters & you've got the best blockbuster I've watched since Infinity War. I disagree with the opinion the plot is just a repeat of the first. It is a continuation & expansion of the first. It's the next stage in the war for Pandora. It has emotional weight. Tears welled in my eyes during some of the visceral, brilliantly constructed scenes where the family is fighting for survival. There are environmental and spiritual themes which give it substance. Immerse yourself in Avatar the way of water."
"Great visuals and effects no doubt, but the story was essentially the same as last time, just with a few dependents thrown in. Lots of plot holes (choking a person unconscious underwater for example), a new valuable resource only found in smart alien whales or whatever new name they have, evil professional soldiers taken out with bows and arrows, that sort of silliness. As with the first movie, I still have qualms about a guy that decides to start killing off his own people, combatants and civilians alike, because his new forest family is apparently better, but that's Hollywood for you.Anyway, the movie is ok and maybe worth a glance when a streaming service picks it up."
This movie is awful. The first one is awful and this one even more awful. Went to see this movie because apparently it's a technical achievement that has never been done before... well I've seen marvel movies that have done the same sort of stuff but even better.The visuals were cool sure but the movie was so boring it's insane. It was a rinse and repeat type of movie for 3 hours. One character does something stupid and gets in trouble and another character saves them and then they get yelled at and say they would never do it again and then they do it again...At least I know that there are 17 more of these coming out and they can't be as bad as this one... can they?
"This movie is just fantastic. Visually with the new technology it's just by far the best 3D movie ever made. The story is great and solid (forget about the comments of the story). It is full of action, drama, love and family. Avatar the way of water is one of those few movies worth to go to cinema and one of those movies people will remember in 50 years. I couldn't imagine that this movie could Top even the first Avatar in terms of visual aspect, but it did.Even after 3 hours you still want to stay in your seat and continue watching.Fabulous masterpiece! Best 3D movie ever! A must watch for any age."
"The first avatar was good. It was pretty, it was simple, it had some nice thematic elements and callbacks to pieces of history, imperialism, etc. The Way of Water is a beautiful epic that ties together every thread it spun in a way that I cannot describe here without being hyperbolic or spoiling the movie. It was and is a top 3 movie of the year, in my opinion, and lives up to every bit of hype and hope created bY the first one. Critics call it shallow, meaningless, or easy to follow, but I would argue a movie that does all the legwork for you so that you can spend the time comparing the feelings and experiences to your own instead of thinking about a plot twist or an unreliable ending is worth all the 3 hours and more. This movie will hurt your heart, make you laugh, and put you in awe of what James Cameron has been working on since the recession. Do not walk to the theater, sprint."
"This film is what the Star Wars sequel trilogy should've felt like. Fleshing out the world in an interesting way and sending us on a sweeping journey through it and its creatures. The Metkayina, and the rest of the oceanic tribes for that matter, felt real and their separate cultures had weight and depth. James Cameron really thought everything through when he was creating this tribe. Visually the film is a marvel so I won't spend too much time on that. All I'll say is once I left the theater I could've sworn the movie looked more real than real life. I know that sounds cliche but it's the truth, it's so beautiful that I feel kind of depressed I can't actually visit Pandora. The story is a huge improvement from the original in every regard. It's still relatively simple but it's done so incredibly well it will most likely have you an emotional mess during the film. This is an emotional film, I didn't cry when Hometree was destroyed in the original but when a certain moment happened in this film I almost broke down at how it was executed. You really care for the characters of the film by the end, the standouts were Kiri and Lo'ak which in my mind stole the show in many regards. James Cameron knows how to make likable child characters in his films and for a younger viewer like myself that is so refreshing.I will never not be amazed that Sigourney Weaver is playing a 14-year-old Na'vi child at 70+ years old, and it never feels weird or fake, that is the power of the technology of this film. It's incredible that we have come this far in film technically yet it's always in service of the actors. The action in this film is top-tier James Cameron, the last hour will have you finding yourself struggling to breathe; that's how good the action in the finale is. Also, I was not expecting the film to be as brutal as it was, maybe it's because I've been exposed too much to ""Marvel"" brutality in PG-13 movies that I forgot that PG-13 movies can actually get pretty brutal if done correctly. One more topic I want to touch upon before I wrap up is some of the cons of the film as even though I love this film it does have a few minor flaws. Firstly, some of the dialogue isn't the best, not all of it just in a few areas. There would be one to two moments where I would say ""hmm...the wording/dialogue could've been enhanced."" Secondly, although I personally wouldn't change it, the second act is a bit on the lengthy side. Even though I love the elements they have in the second act they could've definitely tightened it as I was wondering when we were going to get back to the main conflict. Once again, I loved what they did with that time. Other than that no other complaints with the film really.Avatar: The Way of Water is a film I think we all need right now. In an age of superhero films/tv shows being flashed in front of us almost every day, it's nice to escape to the unknown regions of Pandora for three hours and witness the journey and growth of the Sully family. Like I said in the beginning, this film is what the Star Wars sequel trilogy should've felt like and I fully stand by that. This film is epic in every sense of the word. The Way of Water is on a smaller scale compared to the first, however, it feels even bigger than the first. I'm someone who really likes the original Avatar, now I'm kind of afraid to return to that film after watching this. James Cameron has somehow done it again, he has made a sequel that manages to top the first one in every sense of the word. He has captured the lightning that even I have to admit was somewhat missing from the original Avatar. Bravo James, Bravo."
"During the time of avatar (2009) release I was too young to go experience it for myself. And now with ""the way of water's release, I wanted to experience the same wonder that came with the first film. And James Cameron did not disappoint. The visuals came to no surprise. Immensely surpassing that of the first film. I was really invested in the characters. Showing the sully children grow into their own people with their own problems. And even showing Sully's growth from a marine into a father. I really know that this film deserves the praise and I hope that it will continue even to the third film."
"The visuals and the characters are great and of course you have the predictable events and references to other movies which are funny.The runtime didn't need to be 3 hours long, Jake and the Coloneldidn't need to fight for another hour and Jake's family could've easily gotten through that fire by just going underwater like fire doesn't burn underwater although now I understand why the fire burned on top of the water
It's because of the carbon monoxide I think but then the fire somehow burned in a circle encasing his family.You feel a lot of empathy for Neyetam's death when it happens like my thoughts are ""It must've been pretty scary to be surrounded by your famil knowing you're gonna die but not knowing what's on the otherside"""
"I really want to give this movie a higher score, but I know that visual effects aren't what make a movie. I'm a huge 3D fan and if you are, too, this is some of the best I've seen. The scenery and underwater scenes were amazing as were the underwater creatures.The story, itself, was quite bland. There weren't really any characters that I liked in this. Especially, the new character, Spider. Just picture Takashi 69 if he made better life decisions, but still annoying.So many unneeded scenes that were way too drawn out.Hey. Here's a montage of a kid becoming friends with a giant whale creature. Not enough? Here's another one.Here's a new girl who has powers underwater, but we're not going to tell you how, but we will tell you she has epilepsy.The ""Avatar"" characters were a lot less realistic looking in this one, and still have not yet fully mastered mouth movement on CGI characters.There was really nothing more special about this movie other than the 3D and special effects.If this were a movie with no dialogue and just made up underwater creatures, it would've been more entertaining."
"This movie gets a three-star rating from me purely on its visual merits, and I'm being generous in this regard. This is, after all, a James Cameron movie, and he had 15 years to make it with what was -- in effect -- an unlimited budget.So -- YES -- the visuals are a spectacular achievement. You can see water dripping on the faces of the digitally rendered characters. And that's about it. I believe I'm actually cutting Cameron a break here, because there were actually points in the action sequences where the CGI was bad enough to take me out of the visuals, so the movie has flaws, even in its special effects.As to the rest: this movie is simply embarrassing. The script for the first movie was mediocre at best, and this script is worse. The story is less sophisticated than a Hanna-Barbera cartoon.The first 45 minutes of the movie was a glob of nonsensical exposition that basically resets the plot essentially to the point where the previous movie started. Dead characters are ""resurrected"", the defeated antagonists just ""show up"" again and there's an especially boring insertion of a retroactive origin story setting up a family for the protagonist.What follows is a progression of scenes that are either laughably childish or rip-offs of other movies -- or both.This movie shamelessly lifts sequences or entire scenes from the following films: ""The Road Warrior"" (the feral kid); ""Contact"", ""Platoon"" ('burn the hootches' -- they actually use this line); ""The Lion King"", ""The Karate Kid"", pick any movie were a shy kid forms a friendship with an animal; -- additionally, Cameron's own original ""Avatar"" (of course) ""Aliens"" (pretty much everything do to with the youngest child character); ""Titanic"", ""The Abyss"", even ""Terminator 2"" (the funeral scene).The rest of the plot hinges on the idea that the entire history of this planet depends on the survival or death of the main protagonist who, incidentally, doesn't do much until the final 20 minutes. The bad guy wants to kill him and the rest of the characters pretty much drop whatever they are doing to assist him, with little or no question.There's very little in this move I would call ""acting"", unless you count digitally rendered facial expressions as acting.Then there's the dialog --- oof, what about this dialog? There's a point in this movie where a character says ""You will live among us but first you must learn our ways"". More about this later. When we're not hearing that, we get a TON of militaristic jargon from both the protagonists, and the bad guys, because that's SO cool. Finally, there are the lines given to the younger characters. It's clear this movie was aimed at a teen-age audience, because after that boring first hour, most of the ""adults"" exit stage left. And we get a high-tech version of your standard ""mom and dad made us move and we miss our old house"". It you closed your eyes, you'd think this from what these kids say to each other. Early in the movie, there is a single line of narration that is supposed to dispense with sub-titles (although this rule is implemented inconsistently). The result of this is that the ""kids"" in this movie sound like a bunch of dimwitted high-schoolers. Enemies are called ""bitches"", friends or family are called ""bro"" and I lost count of how many times in the movie ""you got this, or ""I got this"". These are just a few examples. These are lines delivered ENTIRELY by an alien species.Finally, I want to comment on how this movie deals with indigenous cultures. It goes without saying that even more than the first movie, this is a ""capitalist technology (and most humans) bad / peace-loving, natives who are one with nature good"" story. I'm sure most of the audience gets that before the lights go down, and as expected, they are hit over the head with this even more than the original.But, if I was a recent descendant or member of an indigenous culture, I'd be insulted by the way this movie portrays them. In addition to the laughable line mentioned earlier, we hear war-hoops, a ton of hissing and squealing and generally treating characters we're supposed to be rooting for as simpletons. There's a point where one of the tribes, in an attempt to be threatening, all stick their tongues out.I expected very little from this movie (I went because a friend invited me). I received less. I cannot possibly imagine how they intend to make three more of these with a straight face."
"Felt like a copy paste of the first movie which is 13 years old now. They did not learn anything in those 13 years except that if they call a movie Avatar it will make them way too much money. I'm actually upset I watched this movie. They got me. There is not much more to say. This review has a minimum length? Super odd. All I can say is it is a waste of time. The only reason to put this on is for background noise and even then probably not a good idea because of loud sequences. I need 100 more characters. I did not enjoy this movie. It put me to sleep. It was the same as the first movie, seriously."
"For one, to get it out of the way. The movie is a lovely visual experience to behold, it's world building is lovely for the universe it's attached to, and it has some really lovely underwater effects that are extraordinarily difficult to develop and I wish the VFX team the best.Now, this review is a small encapsulation of a wider problem, and that problem is it's protagonist, Jake Sully. Formerly a Marine for the RDA, made hero and saviour of the Omotokaiya people of Pandora in the first movie.The issue? The themes of the movie is that he is supposed to be 'the father', the protector of his family, and keep his family alive as they have to flee from their return.Except, he really shot himself in the foot when it came to raising his children. Namely his three sons (for those who watched the movie, I am considering Spider to be one of the sons). Turns out a Marine Dad like Jake Sully, likes to churn out soldiers more then sons, ones who refer to him as ""Sir"" when in trouble and constantly punished.The neglected second born son, the apparent black sheep embarrassment in the family, who always tries to show himself as worthy of his Dad's attention. However, after being set up to fail in an attempted reconciliation (that Jake forced him to partake in) after a confrontation with the Chief's son; was nearly sent to die in a dangerous part of the waters.After returning, the Secondborn would rather see himself get shouted at by his Dad, than seeing the guy (who NEARLY GOT HIM KILLED by the way) to be get shouted at by the Chief.Jake, your son was just trying to do what you asked him and reconcile with your host's son. Like you asked him. AND HE NEARLY DIED FOR YOUR REQUEST.Then we have Spider, the outcast by his way of being human in a world full of Navi. A troubled soul who doesn't want anything to do with his human life, as his Dad
(MAJOR SPOILERS) was the main bad guy from the first Avatar movie, whom actually makes a return in this one.Spider is treated alright at least, but his experience as the lone human in a world hostile to everything about him, becomes difficult when his exclusion and capture let him glimpse at the atrocities committed by the RDA.Perhaps Jake Sully, a man who used to be EXACTLY LIKE HIM, could help him in this world he is adapting to. But, he only sort of does this. Jake Sully seems to reject Spider as a direct member of the fam, viewing him more as a friend of his children, despite the fact that Spider had been abandoned at birth because ""they can't put babies in cryo"". Yet Jake treats him as someone who could rat them out at any time to the RDA. Because 'after all, he has family with the bad guys now'.This is one part of a strange issue that becomes present with Jake later on.Then, we have the favourite child, the first child. What does Jake Sully think of him? An absolute loyal son who does as he is told. The issue? It is clear that this son, wants to help protect his family too.From trying to protect his own brother from the shouting matches Sully seems ready to hurl for stepping out of line. Knowing that his brother is doing all this to try to gain approval with their Dad, but still validly questions his brother's actions. And though he sees his brother running into many dangerous situations, he still follows along with him as a way to keep the family protected. Surely an exemplary case of what Jake wants, right?(MAJOR SPOILERS) Well, he dies at the end. Doing what his father thought he was supposed to be doing, to protect the family; but sacrificing his life to keep them together. Something that I still don't think Sully understands in the last moments of the film.He was probably the better character of the script, if given the attention. But the story struggles with giving any character attention and story growth besides Sully, the Secondborn, Spider, and Miles Quartich.The first three stories could've used a lot more of the firstborn as a weight, but he struggles to gain the needed detail and focus to become that character that the movie wanted.Then, we go to Nyteri, the Navi Princess of the Omotokaiya. And, oh boy a lot of the movie's flaws shine through.3 hours of movie, and we are given a Nyteri who has to struggle with being forced to become a refugee from her home, who has to adapt to a different culture then she is used to, having to defend her family and kids as they are in danger, and having to deal with the idea that the war they left has come to follow them.What is the problem? Those ideas would've been good to explore and look into. IF she was given the attention.But no, she is given only a few moments of having to talk to her husband, whose advice is mainly 'we have to do this, follow me and do it for them'. The ""suck it up for the family"" route.Which feels... disgusting. A decision which, the best case for a movie with this length might warrant an exploration on what exactly the thoughts of the Navi Princess who was forced to leave her home for the coloniser hero figure that she decided to make a family with having to leave it all behind.But at the worst of times, which the movie elects to do, makes Nyteri a lit fuse, waiting to detonate so she can show us cool action scenes that evokes a similar reaction to the first movie but neglects what let Nyteri to pursue that path in the first place.Especially when, at the end of the movie; (MAJOR SPOILERS) she openly threatens Spider (the surrogate son of the whole family, and dear friend to Nyteri's own children) to get Miles Quartich to release her own daughter. But actively scars and nearly kills him in front of Miles to prove a point.A point on which, I don't much blame Nyteri for, but the psychotic Jake Sully who used her anger at (MAJOR SPOILERS ) her own son's death. To say ""Hey! Wanna get revenge, well I need your anger to kill these people. Let's go!"" Which makes Jake Sully heavily culpable for that situation.That leads to the issues of Jake Sully.Remember when Jake was not only a Marine, but a former paraplegic? Having to ride in the wheelchair to move around, disabled in his own dying world as it struggled to accommodate him? Jake, hearing of Pandora and wanting to set out on a new adventure? The one who learnt to live, love, and explore Pandora? The one who got to learn and was regaled with stories by the best and most open minds that humanity had ever been with the Navi? Jake Sully, who openly joined with those best and bright minds, because he saw the world for the beauty that his friends saw it in? Jake Sully who got in spiritual communication with Ewa herself as he was placed in his Avatar by the Tree of Souls? The one who had only just got to have this experience because his own brother died, and he just happened to be enough of a match to get himself into the program that changed his life?Well, the movie seems to have forgotten that. He still uses RDA tech, he still relies on the scientists that stayed behind, but he seems to have embraced just being a brash Marine type.Jake Sully is a man who should have a lot more understanding then he does. The movie forgetting that, has made him run headfirst into being such a strangely abusive, neglectful, and unreasonable being. A coloniser man, who has ""embraced being native"", who ends up being rewarded for all the sacrifices many others had done for him, and takes the spotlight over the people of Pandora that hurt the most from the RDA."
"The movie picks up from where Avatar 1 ends, but seems like it could not figure where to land next .The movie introduces many new characters and sub plots, but ends up focusing on a predictable revenge story.It fails to allow viewers to connect with the new characters as things move too quickly, so that time could be devoted to a final fight sequence in water that actually reminds of Titanic after a while!Would have loved to see the movie explore under water world or show life on other parts of Pandora or even allow viewers to connect with the new characters more so that we could feel sad when some leave the story at the endOverall this is a 3 hours predictable movie with
40 min of actual visual treat!"
"I got to say that Avater: The Way of Water is incredibly stunning in the visuals, acting is great, the music or score hit the right notes, and the story is satisfactory.This movie must've showed me the best motion capture visuals I have ever scene in my entire life. The Navi and the villagers Metkayina are digitally made so realistic that the skin textures are well-rendered. The motion capture underwater was next-level media creation. The rest of the visual effects are flawless.The acting is good. The spotlight I'm giving for the best performance has to go to Zoe Saldana. When you see or have seen the movie, there is a scene when her emotions are released out, and just by that moment alone proves that she deserves an Oscar nomination.The story, as mentioned in my tagline, is about the same (almost literally). I was basically watching the Navi against the military and machines again. I'm not complaining. I was just surprised since the trailers for this movie that Avatar 2 is exploring that again.The second act did slow down for me because that 2nd third of the movie felt like it was showcasing its highly-advanced motion capture technology and the characters just...hanging around. To be fair before hand, I went through a busy day before watching this movie and I did fall asleep for a few minutes before the action came on.I was also surprised by the amount of violence passable for a PG-13 rating. If James Cameron can pull it off, Marvel and DC can do it too without hold back the story.MILD SPOILERS??? I'm really glad the movie didn't end in a cliffhanger. I would've been annoyed a little bit if this movie strictly ended as a part one of an entire four-part quadrilogy story.Overall, don't let me discourage any of you from watching this movie. It is such an amazing watch and it does deserve its place in the big screen."
"I went to see Avatar 2 on the first day hoping for continuation of the deep story. Unfortunately it is still now just a Hollywood series production, the same problem as Matrix 2. Deep story is exchanged for visual effects hoping that in the blinking lights of explosions we do not notice what is missing. Violence as solution is the main focus of the movie covered sometimes by high preaching. Visual effects are not enough to cover shallow and predictable plot. Movie may receive Oscar for visual effects, but is it enough to see it? Interestingly 4pm showing had only about 50 people in Imax. Shame on Cameron and Hollywood for the effort to dumb down the viewers. I can only imagine what part 3, 4 and 5 will be."
Honestly one of the best films I've seen since things like the Batman and endgame. I would've preferred it if spider died instead of the older brother. Despite still liking what spider added to the movie the older brother was much better of a character I cared about him.I'm glad that the colonel came back as the main villain as I like his actor from what I've seen. But it's kinda annoying that he'll be the villain for the next 3 movies. I felt like if he was more of the side villain to the other military woman (don't know her name) that would've been a lot better in my opinion. Hopefully he does have another character balance him out in the next few movies.
"Great (though sometimes redundant) world building and character building! Its a three hour movie and I wish intermission would return as a thing soon, bc I love the longer movie format but sometimes I need a bathroom break or snacks and I'm left hungry and in pain because I don't want to miss anything.I loved the movie. I felt transported, invested, and so nostalgic with the first movie, which I rewatched in preparation. It's a movie you leave the theater feeling good about.You can feel the care put into the characters, the world of Pandora, the design of the biome, the cultures of different Na'vi, the languages both visual and auditory. Absolutely fantastic. The story is simple but profound and the visuals tell half the story themselves."
"At least 45 minutes of this film could have been cut, the dialogue sharpened up and at least some resemblance of plot sophistication introduced (one of the kids saying 'are we tied up again?' gets my award for best in-joke of the year).If that had happened then we would have had a great film with wonderful effects. Instead its just great effects film which just leads on to the next (which I don't think I will watch as I know whats coming). The effects must be costing so much that the studio is determined to squeeze the most out of it while it can.Overall a disappointing experience which could have been so much better."
"This movie has to be named as the celebration of art of 2022 bcs it was an incredible movie. Great story arc, very clever character usage, and potent character development. The movie was dragging you alongside bcs the stakes were too personal this time. Almost everything about it was personal. It is like Endgame but with a more beautiful and exciting version. You can never get bored thanks to the mesmerising nature portrayals. Finally, I watched a real fantasy/action cinema after a long time. I didn't know that I was hungry for this. Probably I am gonna watch this several times. Thank you James Cameron."
"I mean really. If you saw the 1st one there is no reason to see this one. Unless you really enjoy eye candy and sensory overload and extended ultra violent video game cut scenes. And maybe it was my theater but it was really really loud. Right on the edge of unbearable. The 3d was cool. It really could have been about 1.5 hours shorter. Frankly it was boring. My wife and daughter wanted to leave but we powered thru. Water instead of jungle. Flying fish dragons instead of flying dragons. Green aliens instead of blue. Same ham handed eco one with the planet message. More embarrassing native american whoops pacific islander cultural appropriation. Whales good. Same boring one note villians with zero interior world except revenge and greed. Nobody stays dead and everyone has plot armor (except for poor oldest brother - someone has to kinda maybe probably die, right?) I can't believe there is going to be 1 to 5 more of these. Why? Even the little girl makes fun of the script simplicity when she exclaims ""I can't believe I am tied up again!"" after the 10th time various children were held as hostage bait. I mean to be honest Jake Sulley has brought down a lot of extra death and destruction on these aliens lives. They prob SHOULD hand him over. We hate colonizers but the white saviour trope that is super embarrassing is somehow ok? His alien wife should regret marrying him for sure. This is basically way hotter Ewoks crossed with Dances with Wolves and that is not a good thing. Save these for a late night streaming session and don't waste your time."
"Visually a much improved experience, saw it in IMAX but story a big disappointmentToruk Makto goes on a run scared of a bunch of renegades and some whalers and needs to be rescued by a kid in the end.. really?Could have created a much better story to match the visuals..exploring other tribes of Pandora was the correct approach for subsequent movies, but the story line and purpose of exploration should have been better, to make the experience much more memorable and worth matching multiple times..wont watch the 2nd part again once it comes on OTT platforms, because you endure through it for 3+hrs without getting much in return in the end.."
"Look, this film is an absolute mess. It's an hour longer than it needs to be, the writing is absolutely abysmal at times and most of the characters are annoying as hell. But even then, I still had such a great time watching it. In some ways I love this film, it encapsulates the ""blockbuster movie"" experience so well that, at several moments, tricked me into believing I was actually watching something good.When you stand back and look at the film as a whole confined experience it is just plain odd. When I walked out of the cinema the one word I kept describing it with was weird. It is weird, weird, weird. It blew me away honestly, how they could get so much bang on perfect and so much astoundingly awful. I suppose I'll start talking specifics now, refraining from any spoilers of course.The first 15 or so minutes of the film felt like I was watching a video game cutscene, and this is a problem which plagued a lot of the film for me. A lot of the time I struggled to view the story from the perspective of any one character, greatly detaching me from the events taking place. I think most of this can be explained by the rather strange way this film is shot and edited at times. There are many sequences in the film that look beautiful, don't get me wrong. But at other times I was extremely confused over what the cinematographer's aim was. On countless occasions the camera would do this awkward zoom-in which made it feel like I was watching some kind of nature documentary, and, during many of the action set-pieces the editing was cut together so quickly when the scene would have greatly benefitted from longer takes. Overall, this contributed to the feeling that I was just watching a pure spectacle, rather than a character driven story. And yes, maybe that was intended and if so, fair enough. But if that is the case then what is the point spending so much screen time attempting to develop your characters, because I can tell you, I didn't care about a single one.I'm not going to go into the plot at all, but wow, it is certainly nothing unique or special. Of course, I wasn't expecting it to be and I'm sure that the same can be said for Avatar 1, not that I can remember any of it. Let's just say, don't expect anything you haven't seen a hundred times before, this is just your basic action, adventure storyline, which is totally OK if they nail the visuals and the climatic set pieces, everyone knows what's going to happen so just make the journey as enjoyable as possible. So, did Avatar 2 achieve this?For the most part yes. It almost feels stupid for me to praise the visual effects and CGI because they are so obviously fantastic. However, I think its important for me to mention that there are some sequences, particularly those that are underwater, that I thought were worth the cost of viewing alone. Some sections of this film are just jaw-droppingly beautiful to gaze at, it is a triumphant achievement in visual effects. However, saying this, they still haven't completely nailed it yet. A lot of the shots which involved an avatar and human character in the same frame really pulled me out of it. I'm not sure whether it was a lighting issue or something, but they never felt they were truly taking up the same physical space. My absolute favourite aspect of the film was the sound. They did such an outstanding job with the foley. I could feel every footstep and every drop of rain, definitely worth the cinema experience! I loved it and, as per usual, the score was fantastic. The Avatar theme is definitely one of my favourites, fits the film perfectly.So, the most important question, should you watch it? If I had to give you a straight answer I would say yes, it is worth watching. The sound and visuals alone make this a wonderful experience in cinemas, something I'm sure most people were expecting. It's just such a shame that the film falls short in almost every other aspect of its presentation, and I've limited my rating to a 4 because of this. If I were to rate it on my pure enjoyment, I would have to give it an 8, but that's not how I rate films."
"If this movies was made by a group of students from a film academy, this would be a great movie considering it would came from a group of young people that are still learning how to make a movie and tell an interesting story. But, for a movie of this calibre and with such an expensive production, this is just a big disappointment. This story was in making for 13 years! That's a bit funny actually.Firstly, everyone is praising the visuals, and even though that's the best part of the movie, it's nothing new and was already seen in the first movie. Even CGI is not noticeably better from the first one. So, there was no excitement for me, except for some beautiful shots of the Pandora natures.Secondly, the dialog is just unbelievable bad. I can't believe how irritating it was in certain moments. Very dull and forced most of the times, but on top of that, they constantly forced slang like ""bro"", ""cuz"", ""babygirl"", etc., which made it even more cringeworthy.The funniest thing about the plot is that it hasn't moved an inch forward from the first one. It just made a full circle, the main villain is still here, humans are still on the planet, evil as ever, and they again unsuccessfully tried to wipe off some avatars from the planet. The third one could easily follow the same plot structure based on the formula from the first two, but in some Pandora's desert this time, or something. In my opinion, almost completely lost three hours of any potential story development. Very little to almost no character development too, aside from the outcasted super-intelligent whale that has become friends with one of Jake's kids. So, these whales are really intelligente, they do maths, sing, write songs, etc. They are extreme pacifists too, which is something humans take advantage off when killing them because of some anti-age serum they have in their brains or something. Probably the deepest moment of the movie. But, in short, humans try to kill Jake and his tribe, they don't succeed, and we meet his kids, that's all. And yes, we discover the water world of pandora, some parts of it.Also, the plot felt rushed, which is actually funny for an almost three-hour movie with no plot!One big thing too, what's with all that patriarchal BS. With lines like ""A man has to protect his family"", or ""emotional"" women and ""a proud father"" when his sons kick other sons asses. I thought we were past that. I'd say it looked cheap and clichéd.All in all, just not a good movie - 4/10, maybe 5/10, but nothing more."
I dont know why everyone hates it its amazing people are just made that humans would do that to another species if we had the chance to amazing storyline and graphics I cant wait for avatar 3 I definitely got more than I expected I never felt bored I cried and it was amazing the whole film 10 out of 10. The actors were doing a great job i think that the this movie wasn't a remake of the first movie it was a continuing story I mad a bit made that I have to wait 2 years for avatar 3 but at least its coming out I know whatever James cameron directs is going to be good because he's not scared of what people will think.
"""Just look at what we can do now!""
""And we can do it even longer: 3h12m versus the 2h42m of our first movie!""A good film, held back from being great by rampant and heavy-handed emotional manipulation of the audience. Clichés and plot contrivances abound.For example, these amazing undersea behemoths are not only surprisingly whale-like, they're also peace-loving, creative, and affectionate. Sadly their brains just happen to have something incredibly valuable to the Sky People: a thing that stops human aging.What a tragic coincidence! Why is fate so cruel?!Similarly and conveniently, in the first film, planet Pandora harbors an incredibly valuable ore known as Unobtainium. Yet tragically, the native Na'vi city just happens to be built right on top of the most abundant source of Unobtainium!What an awful dilemma!Save the whales! Save them because they're even smarter than we are; plus they have adorable children. The uncannily human-like Na'vi also have endearing children--lots of them.Watch in horror as the terribly cruel Sky People exploit the Na'vi and slaughter the whales. Scowl in revulsion as the Na'vi are forced from their homes, and their beautiful forest is strip-mined.On a brighter note, despite the blatant manipulation and contrivances, and notwithstanding having too many characters and running too long for most viewers' tastes, Way of Water is markedly better than the first film: artfully leveraging technology to sensational effect. Indeed, Way of Water blends CGI with reality far more seamlessly than its predecessor while setting the bar crazy-high for any action and effects extravaganza that might dare challenge it.Even the story and characters struck me as better than in the first film. Admittedly that isn't saying much because we're talking about James here.Overall I found it a good film, especially for viewers who enjoy basking in a full-immersion 3D experience: replete with jaw-dropping action and effects; drenched in panoramic skyscapes, seascapes and landscapes. Truly the movie delivers thrills aplenty: witness the breathtaking planet-razing power of starships! Cower back from the terrifying presence of gargantuan ocean predators!In summary, despite its many limitations I enjoyed Way of Water--especially seeing it in 3D."
The movie was so boring that I preferred going out to buy snacks without feeling even once that I need to hurry back to the screen.The story is a drag and the logic driving the movie completely non-sensical and lame. It's fine that the director wants to showcase his visuals around a water theme but then he should have taken some more pain with the plot to ensure that the plot is driving the movie to the water rather than the visuals driving sinking the plot into the water.The plot just keeps hitting new lows.The kids would and might enjoy the movie but it surely isn't for anyone who wants some substance in the story than just stunning visuals. Even the visuals become an overdose after a while.
"""The way of water has no beginning and has no end"" is the quote about the philosophy in the film but it also sums up the movie perfectly At the beginning the 'sky people' are at war with the Na'Vi. What happened to Unobtainium? I guess they obtained it. Why are they fighting? Revenge seems to be the only reason. Jake Sully must work with his Na'Vi family to save them. To do this they decide to hide with the Metkayina, the water people. This leads to almost a soap opera section where the family, especially the children, try to fit in. Later on we get introduced to the tulkun, intelligent friendly whales like creatures. In effect it becomes a save the whales section. Now the overall effect is not bad. It could be shorter and tell the same story. When you're in a cinema with recliners you get a small number of people moving past you to and from comfort breaks which is a bit distracting. The ending seems unsatisfactory. Perhaps they want an Avatar 3? Overall a good.brilliant vibrant film with some stupendous fight scenes. The plot is slender but adequate so I class it as pleasant, watchable but not great."
"In a technical point of view, the movie is a true masterpiece. The world looks amazing and you can almost feel part of the incredible world they live in. That is why you have to watch it in 3D in theaters. 3D has come a long way and is not with the weird blue-red glasses anymore.Storywise, I was so disappointed. I have friends who can tell a beter story in a bar than what they managed to do for 3h of movie. It seems harsh but from a million dollar investment, I expected a lot more. I will never watch this movie again and would not advise anyone to stream it for example on their laptops with headphones."
"""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is a movie that transports one to an alternate reality. The writers, directors, and all involved, created an immersive experience. I felt as if I was part of this world and became emotionally involved in the lives of the inhabitants.The cinematography and CG are stunning! Few movies ever reach this level of realism and believability.The acting is superb. I was especially impressed with the young actors. They were convincing in their roles. There were a few moments when Zoe Saldana was not as convincing with her crying scenes. These are easily overlooked with how spectacular the rest of the movie is.This movie will go down in history as one of the best movies of all time. It has everything I love in a movie: action, adventure, some romance, comedy, and authenticity."
"Look I don't know how to spin up words 100 different ways. So to simply put it, This movie is the Best Visually stunning thing I have ever watched so far. After watching the film I was so much in Awe that I looked for people's reaction online. Many people trash talked about it that this movie has no plot. But what I look in movies like this is how far technology has come. How much beauty out there am I missing out there in the real world? This movie gave me a hard knockout punch and reset my brain to know my priorities. That's what defines a Great Movie to me. Not some action packed kissass plot. I think this was the Grand vision of Mr. Cameron. I have being following him for a while now and I think I know his Vision. I used to wonder why he talks so much about underwater. But after seeing this movie I realized he is a Billion times right. Underwater is way too beautiful. It must be protected from us Human eyes. So if some person talks bad about this movie and discourages more people in watching, then they are indirectly doing goodness to Mr. Cameron Vision. Go ahead. Underwater world is not for all. But I will have this in Bluray 4K and own a copy for sure. Just my little secret. My new stress reliever.I mean come on. If what you really want is a sick plot to thrill, then why would it take 3+ hours runtime to give what you want? Just put some sense into it first and realize that there is never a Great Or Majestic plot for a movie which is 3+ hours long!!If you are planning to watch it, just watch it in 3D and that too only in theaters. Otherwise, you are doing yourself a disservice. After watching it and coming out, think for a minute. Just recall. When was the last time you saw something so beautiful in your life? Don't tell me Avengers Endgame. If still this felt a waste of time, I strongly question your taste and it is very odd.There is no beginning or end to the way of the water. Peace."
"This is basicly just a mainstream action flick in a beautiful setting. I guess I shouldn't have expected a fantastic story, but I was still hoping for a more interesting look into the beautiful world of pandora, but instead it's the same old (literally) marine grunts spewing stupid oneliners and a braveheartlooking main character that still sounds like a stupid grunt and runs his family like a marine squad (so much for learning the pandora way). If you like watching hollywood action movies with lots of shooting, good vs evil and ""tough"" oneliners, then this is your kind of movie.I recently rewatched the first avatar movie and it's just better in every way. Visuals are 10/10, but rest is just disappointing.6 stars."
"A Visual Masterpiece, no one is arguing that. The picture transports you to another world where you feel like you are swimming and diving with the animals and Avatars. The effects are phenomenal and you can tell that they took their time with those.With that being said, I wish they had spent only half as much time on the actual storyline and plot and characters. It's clearly predictable what will happen and to whom, and I wish there had been solid character development. Everything except for the visuals are subpar at best. I would never call this a good film. It is more of a spectacle, like visiting an amusement park or such."
"1. WHERE did the sea Avatar go when they were about to fight alongside Sully?? I was so disappointed because I was expecting to see their skills and way of communicating with the Sullly to fight big boss. But this never happened and it ended up Sully vs boss. Boring and very cliché.2. I give it 3 stars for the beautiful sea creatures and animations, but this movie lacks of power and mote skills. I waited 13 years for this? How is that even possible? I think people who gives thus more than 5stars out of 10, are more in love with Avatar itself and the graphics it comes with. But when it comes to story, it's a disappointment."
"If You want to swim on new planet among gorgeous creatures then you have to watch it in theaters.SWAM in Avatar 2 once again. It is an ORGY of MAGNIFIQUE visuals, SPELLBINDING performances and BREATHTAKING action. GOD created earth and James Cameron created PANDORA and I'd rather live in the latter. Nobody and I mean NOBODY knows how to make a sequel better than James Cameron.Slow start that led to an amazing story about family. The most visually beautiful movie I've ever seen. Epic ending with emotional action that made the 3 hours feel like it was too short, 13 years in the making well worth it.I'll wait for Avatar 3."
"Over the holidays 2022, my husband and I took our Nephews ages 11, 13 and 15.75 to watch this. The visuals were amazing but the story was predictable and lazy.The VFX and environmental effects were the best you could produce... But the females were objectified and the makes were bros who never listened. It's like the human brain dead part of their anatomy over powered the other 98% of the genetic construct of their being.Not one of us left the theater feeling inspired or impressed by what we ingested. It lacked originality and character depth.I would recommend waiting until it comes to a streaming platform."
"""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is a really new American movie now from 2022 still and without a doubt this is going to end up as one of the big players this awards season. Probably almost everybody (in the western world) has by now seen the original Avatar movie from 2009 and maybe some still remember that, back then, it was a close fight at the Oscars between James Cameron and his wife Kathryn Bigelow for the most prestigious trophies. This year, there is no Bigelow film in contention, but still the new ""Avatar"" film is not going to dominate at the Oscars again. Nominations for Best Picture and Cameron's direction seem possible though, maybe even likely. The one thing where this film should really have a great shot at winning is the visual effects category, but that might be it. Then again, it is only awards. Clearly, this project meant/means a lot to Cameron and that is why he is also one of the writers and also among the editors. Obviously, you cannot call a movie of these dimensions a one-person project, but he has contributed really as much as he could have. It's been 13 years already since the first Avatar film. Now that went quickly. I think the plan was to make four or five avatar films in total, but I am not sure what the situation there is right now. The one thing that is safe, however, is that they cannot take a decade between each film and the next anymore. We will see.In the cast here, you will find pretty much all the names of the key players from the first Avatar movie. This is not a huge surprise. I mean given the gigantic amount of people that will see this film here, everybody would agree to be on board, especially lead actor Sam Worthington whose career has not gone super great in the last thirteen years. Zoe Saldana is also still waiting for her first Oscar nomination and has not really achieved anything beyond Kids Choice and BET Awards so far. The more surprising aspect is perhaps that Sigourney Weaver and Stephen Lang are also part of the cast again. Well, Weaver is listed really early in the credits, but she is only in one scene of the movie and that's it. As for Lang, his return has to do with the bad guys from the first film, i.e. The soldiers/humans, here returning as Avatars just like the ones at the center of the story. Their intentions are not honorable though obviously, so you can say that the good guys here fight once again against the same enemies like from the first film, only that those enemies look different now. They are also transformed. I will not go into detail about all the cast members now, but you will find more familiar names (rather than faces maybe) like Jemaine Clement, Edie Falco and even Oscar winner Kate Winslet. Was she in the first already? I don't think so. I guess money makes the difference and she starred in Cameron's ""Titanic"" of course. The biggest negative criticism for the first film and maybe also eventually the reason why it did not win the Best Picture Oscar was that the story is just not new, not good, not original enough, so this time Cameron got two other screen writers on board, namely Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver who have worked together on many occasions and are familiar with blockbusters because of their contributions to the Planet of the Apes and Jurassic franchise. With them in charge, it is not a surprise that subtlety was not a thing here. The running time of comfortably over three hours confirms this too. And eventually, it can also be seen throughout the film on many occasions.One thing that caught my attention was that there is almost no comedy at all in this movie. I mean obviously I did not expect constant laughs here, but you see slight comic relief even in the most serious films nowadays, also fantasy or science fiction films. Just look at Saldana's Guardians of the Galaxy movies. I guess that the complete absence of lighter material here is because they (or Cameron) did not want to take away just one bit of the gravitas of the entire scenario in terms of how nature is threatened and same is true for the lives and loves of the main characters. But in some moments, a little bit more subtlety actually would have been nice. For me this includes Neytiri for example. I am really struggling with this character and I found it fitting how she is described by the bad guy on one occasion as totally insane. I mean she is clearly hypersensitive in terms of her senses too, but her screaming when something bad happens to nature, her peaceful singing, her mother instinct that has her fully ready to kill whoever she has to in order to protect her kids etc. It was all a bit much. Also that there were no fewer than four children already. Indeed, they have been busy procreating. There is a ten-year break between the end of the first film and the key action of this one and a lot happened in-between. I still found it a bit confusing when we see this invasion at the beginning, everything in flames and then we read the letters that another year passed, so yeah big jumps in time we have here in this movie. Maybe a bit exaggerated. I must say once again that the writing is not the movie's biggest strength. I feared this would be the case and while it is not horrible, still these moments like when one of the kids spots another female from the water people and we immediately understand there is probably romance going to happen between these two. Of course, she also defends him a little later when the water tribe folks teach our heroes their skills or at least takes them into their world. There are more moments like this when the film could have needed more subtlety and depth instead of staying above the surface for the most time. Sorry, I just had to. Enough with the water metaphors now though. This lack of subtlety is crucial in a not so positive way you could say.Those were a handful negative aspects that I listed by now, but still I think this film deserves a positive recommendation as a whole. The visual side is breathtaking indeed and pretty much what keeps the film from sinking. Oops, I did it again. Sorry. The whale-like creatures were really cool and mesmerizing, even if there it was a bit ridiculous that the protagonist's son would tame this creature right away out of nowhere during their first encounter. I mean running into it was already enough of a coincidence. The bad guy taming another creature just like Sully did in the first film felt more interesting. He is not completely hopeless and really created a bond with his son, so he is not absolutely cold and emotional. Oh yeah, the screaming from characters to express their discomfort (also like the son does in his final scene) or the many examples of how humans are exploiting or trying to exploit nature were another area where it just became too much and too much of an instructive pile. The message is right of course, but sometimes less is more. There were still many nice moments and decent attention to detail, like when we saw one female character (I think Falco) during workout early on, but she was only moving her artificial skeleton there. Or the torture scene when they are looking inside one character's brain was also interesting to watch. So the film is also a big success visually when we are not outside in the open, in the wild nature. I will maybe cheer for this one that it wins the special effects Oscar. I know Hollywood does not really love James Cameron too much, certainly not as much as he would like it to be the case, but this film not winning said award would be a travesty with all the effort and time they put in it.I have to be critical though. Maybe making a less intensive film every two or three years instead of one like this that needs over a decade to get released might be the better idea. No offense to Cameron though. It is his choice alone and the outcome is convincing and there was never a moment when I would give it a thumbs-down. Also, the box office will surely be a major success again. I would even say that I think this film here is superior to the first where honestly the story was just totally uninspired at times, regardless if it was Pocahontas or not. So improvement is there. That is it then overall I guess. Just a few more notes: It surprised me that one male character died here towards the end because they tried so hard for the entire film to not kill off any bigger players. Then again, it came short on the emotional side I must say. It is just still fairly difficult for me to truly care for the non-human, non-animal characters in the middle of this franchise. Weaver is a solid actress, but her inclusion here was really just for the sake of it. Could have been left out. The references to tails were awkward in a slightly funny way. I am sure it was not intended this way, rather like depicting them closer to animals because monkeys pull each other's tails too. The music was alright, maybe too often they brought back the ""I See You"" tune (and words as well during dialogue) and I write that as somebody who likes the song. Fitting name also given the eyes of these whale creatures. Those alone were better than the once again exaggerated segment in which the boy helps the injured creature. By the way, the other marine creatures were cool too, like the ones that are just there, but do not get a whole lot of elaboration really and are also not a factor in terms of the story. Alright, that is all then. I give the second Avatar movie a thumbs-up and I suggest you give it a go. I did not watch 3D, so I cannot say if this is the right choice for the best experience. It's probably more crucial you watch it on the big screen. Will take some time anyway still until it can be seen on a small screen legally. I would say that this film was pretty much exactly what I expected. It delivered 100% visually, had story weaknesses, but was a solid experience on the big screen. Not a must-see or close to my favorites from 2023 though. Or 2022 if we go by release dates. Still, go see it."
"I hate movies when the plot is written solely on the dumbness of the kids which is only an excuse for poor writing and screenplay. This, in my opinion will only work for teen kids and definitely not for adults expecting some meaningful story in 3+ hours runtime. Absolutely stunning visuals but with no story. Now after leaving the theatre I just feel disappointed of wasting 190 minutes. The climax could have been trimmed down by atleast 10 minutes. They let one of the main character alive just for the next part. Too many cringe moments like that and the kids behaving dumb just to extend the movie will make you irritated. I liked the 1st part a hundred times more as it was a fresh idea and visuals. No effort was made here to even achieve 10% of the awe the first part brought. Sorry I might have went in with more expectations but now I really hope they don't do the next part."
"It took 13 years before this one. That is a long time to make a sequel and make perfect it.What I find amazing is, that Avatar 1 has held up on its own enough to make expectations big for this one.This sequel ""The way of water"" lacks all the subliminal messages the first one is full of, these little hidden meanings, that makes you think. It lacks everything that made the first one so good that it has held up for 13 years. Sure the effects are just as good as the first one, but the movie itself has absolutely not been worth the wait. The script can't have been more than a few pages long.This movie has not been worth the wait to be honest. It has actually turned me off regarding wanting to see part 3-4-5.It is a perfect example that effects alone can't carry a movie.I'll stick to watching the first one."
"I really enjoyed this movie and took it as a riveting and organic sequel, I know there will be some ethnocentric haters, but it does nicely compliment the history of Earth in the past, present and potentially the near future. If you can get past tribalism i think you'll love it. The character develolment is excellent and seeing Jake move forwards from a multifaceted perspective made it all the more interesting. I like that they have layered the movie from the land to water and i'm guessing more time will be spent with storylines moving forwards in the air or potentially even a combination of all three strata i.e. Land, air and water."
"Not a bad movie, but nothing special. The effects where cool but could have been an hour shorter. The story was kinda boring and nothing I haven't seen before (most of it in the first Avatar). Can't agree with all the praise I've heard.The bad guy is the same as the old one, even though he died in the first movie. I hate when they do that it gives any of the following deaths less meaning because you never know if it sticks.Can't believe they made us wait soo many years for a sequel. Feels like they spend all these years on the effects and none of the time on the script and the story. They just recycled the old one."
"Having waited endlessly for the sequil to Avatar I was finally blessed with seeing part 2 of one of my favorite movies of all time.I like many watched the first for the hundred time just to get the mood right. Big mistake.Avatar 2 pretty much spends 5 hours of the 3 hour movie showing of it's cgi that was done in avatar 1 with perfection but pretty much throws in a weak storyline to explain a new location for the movie and with incredebly lacking explanations for what has happened and is going to happen and pretty much all excitement in the movie is created by saying ""KIDS""I gave it 5 stars for the CGI and visualisation since even though I got bored to death from it I do realise it was top top quality. But for story and actions of the characters it is so lacking that I'm happy that I will not be waiting for avatar 3, I would have been fine if that was the end of this franchise.I find this extremely strange since James Cameron is not a screw up. He must have had interns write the script and edit the movie."
"I'm a Cameron fan, and have always liked how muscular his filmmaking style is, in many ways perfectly logical and put together. And while I agree with some other reviewers that Avatar 2 is perhaps not as riveting a bit of storytelling as the first film, and also perhaps not as innovative, it's still a brilliant outing. If only because of the utterly beautiful world that Cameron has created, which for me inspired moments of genuine awe. Gorgeous bit of filmmaking.It works dramatically, although perhaps not as well as the first film, but you have to admire the ambition of making film that's entirely done in CG, and while it feels very animated, it's also very much alive, and certainly the greatest exposition of computerised filmmaking I've ever seen. Every one of the 350 million dollars is on screen I feel, and the entire film is pervaded by quality work and genuine creativity. It isn't a work of art as a whole (although some of the underwater life scenes do approach art), but superb watching, and as an audience member, I'm grateful that Camerons exist, and are funded as well as he is!Kudos to the Hollywood system as well, pulling off something of this magnitude and risk. Terrific - do go watch in the cinemas and support filmmaking guys!"
"Permanently inside his avatar, Jake Sully is living the Na'vi life, with his wife Neytiri and their four kids - Neteyam, Lo'ak, Tuk, and the adopted Kiri.Unfortunately, things get turned upside down when the humans show up again, looking to conquer and colonise Pandora, now that Earth has fallen apart.Using guerilla warfare, Jake declares war on the invading Earthlings, a move that results in the military forces resurrecting Colonel Quaritch and several dead Marines as revenge-obsessed Na'vi, dedicated to hunting Jake down.....What can be said about Avatar 2 that hasn't been said already. It needs to be seen on the big screen, that's Cameron's vision, and it, and he, never do anything small. Say what you like about the director, he hasn't really ever made a bad film, Pirhana 2 aside. He's always been about spectacle, and here the film delivers. Really delivers.And at the heart of all of his films are families, particularly the mother figure. Saldana is the standout here as Neytiri, her emotions in turmoil throughout, as she deals with loss after loss as the film trundles along. And as for that running time, at times it feels a little overpowering, especially in the second act, where the family are trying to adapt, you really want Quaritch to just get on with it and let the final battle commence.And when it arrives, it's nothing short of cinematic brilliance. Yes, it borrows heavily from T2 and Aliens, but they are Cameron's, so it's not really copying much, he's just blowing the dust from his 'if it's not broke, don't fix it' manual.I'm still amazed that it's made the amount of money that it has. Yes it's technically the best thing ever seen on screen, but it drags at times, really drags, and it could have done with a good half hour cut from it.But then who am I to say anything, the masses have spoken, and they will again.And again."
"To be honest, movie was really awesome.I was stunned with the way that emotions have been transfered with something that don't exist. Also, i tell this as viewer, and not some person who just goes to find something bad in every movie. If you like fantasy, and magnificent view of some world that does not exist, then you will like this.The only thing that i can say that's missing, is that they should at least make it few minutes more longer, to explain some things that happen in the movie.I reccomend it warmly, and i hope you will enjoy it. For me it was very pleasent expirience, and can't wait for next one."
"A long film for 182 minutes but I would say the time passed well. Good sense of pace, action and strong character development amongst some visually beautiful scenes. The story was bland though, it didn't build on A1 much and the same reasons for being there and the protagonists are a bit boring. For money, this time randomly something from whale brain rather than a precious ore. The colonial didn't need bringing back. You've travelled light years to get there and you just want a row with the natives. It could have been so much better would be my final conclusion although Avatar 3 should be a hoot."
"It's wild how much better 'Avatar: The Way Of Water (2022)' looks than its predecessor, which is a phenomenal-looking film that mostly still holds up thirteen years after its release and even outperforms the majority of its modern competitors. It's honesty mind-blowing how absolutely amazing this long-anticipated sequel looks in every single scene, a truly unprecedented feat of visual effects wizardry that very well might be the most aesthetically pleasing movie ever put on a screen of any size. Of course, the ideal way to watch the piece is in its intended format of IMAX 3D; I can safely say that you should experience this on as big a screen as possible at least once in your life. I am a firm believer that a good film is a good film no matter how you watch it, be it at the cinema with surround sound or on your mobile with headphones. I don't know how successful the flick will be at home in 2D on a significantly smaller screen with a significantly less powerful sound system, but that's almost irrelevant to its success as a big-screen experience. If you can, go and see it at the cinema; you won't be disappointed. Besides, it's not as if I only enjoy the picture as an IMAX showcase and I strongly suspect its beauty will shine through no matter how it's seen.There is one downside to its presentation, though, and that's its incredibly noticeable variable frame rate. James Cameron's odd decision to flicker back and forth between 24 and 48 frames per second comes close to ruining some of the film's best action scenes, principally because it never quite gives you enough time to adjust to either mode. When it cuts to 48, sometimes the action seems to speed up (to distracting and comical effect), almost as if the scene was rendered at 24 and played back at twice the speed. When it cuts to 24, sometimes things seem to jitter as if the film is lagging. Whether these effects are caused by an optical illusion or a genuine rendering issue is irrelevant, as they're distracting enough to mention as a serious problem. The variable frame rate isn't always an issue, but even its smoothest transitions are a little jarring and their frequency is frustrating, for sure. There's no reason why the whole affair couldn't have been presented in either 24 or 48 frames per second, both of which have their advantages. Other than the frame rate, there isn't a single thing that stands out as less than stellar about the visuals of the film. It truly is the best-looking picture I've ever seen, and the power of that can't be understated.Presentation is only one half of the puzzle, and the first 'Avatar (2009)' fell short somewhat when it came to the other. Luckily, although it still has several narrative issues, this follow-up is noticeably better than Cameron's first effort when it comes to its story. The first act almost feels like a different film to the second and third (which arguably have a three-act structure in their own right), as it essentially represents an extended prologue that sets up the rest of the narrative. The start of the second act is marked by a change in location and a shift in perspective from Jake Sulley and Neytiri to their four children and their their efforts to integrate into their new watery surroundings. The new locale is refreshing and vibrant, beautiful in its tranquility and its marked differences from the mountains and forests of the first film. It's here that the flick really comes into its own (although that's not to imply the first movement isn't solid), allowing us a lot of time to become accustomed to the way of water and the young characters we're now following. It's almost a chill, pro-environmental hang-out movie for its middle portion and it works surprisingly well. In fact, even at over three hours in length, I don't think the feature feels too long and it never even comes close to being boring. The slower pacing affords a lot of time to get to know the characters and world, avoiding the first flick's issue of skipping interesting development in montage and rushing character arcs. The decision to establish a human-on-Na'vi war and then background it entirely is surprisingly successful, as it allows the flick to focus fully on the Sulley family unit. The stakes are pretty much entirely personal and this makes for some genuinely moving moments. It's unfortunate that Jake and Neytiri all but disappear from the middle section, only popping up occasionally to reinforce the arcs of their children. The latter, especially, is incredibly underserved, as she never really gets anything to do even when she's present. Thankfully, she gets some great action scenes in the last act.Speaking of the last act, the finale is absolutely great. It's incredibly entertaining, an exciting and surprisingly violent battle filled with Na'vi warriors tossing humans around like rag dolls, spearing them through the heart, shooting them in the head with their giant arrows and working with the creatures of the sea to maim them in a variety of devilishly enjoyable ways. It's a high-octane thrill ride that gets you on the edge of your seat and keeps you there until it's over. It's weird that the water tribe literally vanishes halfway through the finale, but at least the focus rightfully remains on the Sulley family. It's a satisfying final movement that's undercut slightly by a somewhat unbelievable character decision and a last-minute pseudo sequel tease that highlights how potentially inconsequential this piece's plot may be in the grand scheme of the upcoming 'Avatar' franchise (which doesn't reduce its success as an insular, interpersonal story but does distract from it somewhat as the credits start to roll). There are also a couple of narrative elements that are introduced and all but dropped, presumably because they'll be elaborated upon in later sequels. This is slightly frustrating, but it isn't a major problem in the grand scheme of things.Although it isn't exactly a masterpiece, the screenplay does what it needs to and its underlying messages are potent and important. It takes quite a few risks in terms of pacing, which I feel pay off significantly and make for a more distinct and effective end result. It's a more mature film than its predecessor, in a way, and it's constantly compelling. The movie isn't exactly an actor's showcase, but the motion capture has been improved to the point that it feels like a near one-to-one translation of the performances. The main players are all really good, selling even the cheesiest lines of dialogue (which are far less frequent than in the first film) and conveying a lot of emotion. There are actually some scenes that come close to provoking tears, too; it's a surprisingly affecting film at times.Ultimately, this is a visually astounding feature that often drops your jaw with its aesthetics alone. There's a strong emphasis on character and world, the pacing is assured, the slow moments are almost as engaging as the action scenes and the finale is absolutely brilliant. It's an entertaining and enjoyable feature for pretty much the entirety of its gargantuan 192-minute duration, and its presentation is something that absolutely needs to be experienced at least once (and in IMAX 3D if possible). Perhaps it won't hold up quite as well on a rewatch at home, but you can't deny its genius as a genuine cinematic marvel."
"Just slogged through three hours of ""lookie what I can do"" from Jim Cameron. Amazing special effects, best 3-D ever, but I couldn't care less about a single character and the entire ""story"" (yes, quotes because there barely was one) seemed like a 3-hour Save The Whales campaign. I remember being blown away by the first Avatar movie, but only because it was so immersive and incredible from an effects perspective. We watched it again when it came out on DVD and felt so let down. Without the big screen, big surround sound and 3-D it was just a so-so story with so-so acting. Same today except that now the special effects are so over-the-top that THEY are the stars (and the focus) of this movie. If you love all the new stuff they can do with CGI you may love this, but for me it needed a lot more weight on the story, acting, and characterizations side of the balancing act. If it's just showing off all the cool things you can do it's not a movie, it's just show-and-tell. It also didn't help that no one seems to know how to behave in theaters anymore. Turn off your screens (completely!), stop talking, don't bring toddlers to PG-13 movies, and don't go to the movies if you're hacking up body parts. Silence and respect for your fellow humans have truly become lost art forms. 😢"
"STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulJake Sully (Sam Worthington) has settled in to life on Pandora, with his Na, vi wife, Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) and two kids. However, a regenerated Captain Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his team have resurfaced, and are able to emulate the Na, vi people, and mount another attack on Pandora. Quaritch's son, Spider is captured, compromising Jake and his family, and forcing them to retreat to a new home, with a new breed of people, where loyalties are tested, an ultimate battle looms.A sequel to Avatar, James Cameron's million dollar, box office smashing epic, had a ring of inevitability about it from the start. Even if it did take over ten years to arrive, unlike Cameron's other multi million, box office breaking hit Titanic, it wasn't built within the framework of a true story, with events already panned out, and so a follow up was set in the wings, however flimsy and loose the story may feel, a sequel being a commercial investment after all. And while he's spared nothing on the effects, he's also gone all out with the length, at a whopping three hours and ten minutes (approximately.) The words 'excessive' and 'indulgent' spring to mind.The main selling point is of course the effects, so you'll get the best experience with either an IMAX presentation, or, like I did, a 3D showing. On this very basic level, it's a treat, an absolute visual spectacular, with sweeping cinematography, lavish set design and colourful costumes, certainly a pleasing assault on the senses. But much like the original in many ways, the dialogue and story are pretty threadbare, and without much beneath the surface. Yes, there are the themes from the original about tolerance, and accepting others, and while they have a point, none of it is moving or stirring enough to really generate the feelings it should. And, stretching at over three hours, it starts to become a strain.It could be argued that the wonder and spectacle of the effects is enough in itself to make it a masterpiece, but you can't ignore the fundamentals. As mind blowing as it is, you could get the same effect from a theme park ride. Need a bit more from a film. ***"
"Had I viewed this movie by myself, I probably would have rated it 2/10. But I took my grandkids (8, 10), and their response is the reason for the addition of extra points.Full disclosure: I was no fan of the 2009 original, but appreciated the technical work on display. The story wasn't merely simple, but fundamentally simple-minded, as though reverse-engineered from pre-existing set and character designs.The sequel, The Way Of Water, is so hollow and pointless that it makes Avatar 1 seem dense and complex. It is a story that could easily have been outlined in a single pencil sketch, yet the resultant film is somehow over three hours in length. Which means that the middle third, more than 60 minutes, is all shots of blue people swimming with eels and clownfish.That's not hyperbole. This movie is fully 33% swimming... but it looks gorgeous. If you're the type of person who gets nostalgic for the screensavers of yore, this is the movie for you.I was reluctant to take the kids because of the excessive runtime, but realized they'd never experienced 3D in the cinema (and may never get another chance), so I bit the bullet. I told them, ""It's a long film. We don't have to stay to the end. Just tell me if you're getting tired of it.""At the 2-hour mark, though, it was I that longed to check out and go home.Those two went right to the end, and wanted more. The 10 year old declared, ""Best movie I've ever seen!"" And the 8-year old allowed that it was ""pretty awesome.""And that was the true joy of the thing.Avatar 2 is a childish movie, but, unlike Avatar 1, it may actually be FOR children. And that's a whole new context. Five kids are the narrative focus, and the youngest two had my youngest two absolutely enthralled.So... Thumbs-up, with reservations.Beautiful emptiness for grown-ups.Pure magic for kids."
"Be warned that this movie is not for families and children! Children are targeted with guns, a bleeding wound is cut on the child's neck with a knife, and one of the children dies. Now that said, we can move on to my review.I really liked these James Cameron movies: The Terminator, Aliens, Titanic and of course Avatar. But Avatar: The Way of Water feels like it's not a James Cameron movie.The length of the movie in my country is 3 hours and 28 minutes including commercials, which is absolutely insane. The length of the film itself is about 3 hours, which is clearly too much. 2 hours would be more appropriate, because the viewer would lose nothing. The story develops very slowly, and many questions are left in the air that are never answered.The story is almost the same as in the first movie - bad people come to fight with the locals. But in this movie, Jake Sully has a family. These family members are acting very strangely and keep repeating the same things.I noticed that a lot of materials from the first movie have been used, both in terms of sound and scenes. This is not a very good decision in my opinion because I have already heard and seen it.The big bad antagonist is Colonel Miles Quaritch, you guessed it, the same character from the first movie. I didn't expect this and it's just awful. This same character learns exactly where Jake Sully is based on one of the roque helicopters. How is that possible? Anyone can have a fun ride with it.Avatar: The Way of Water introduces only one important underwater species and that is the large whale. And that's it!The last battle is also where they go with the water tribe to save Jake Sully's children and at one point the whole tribe is gone (evaporated into thin air), and Jake has to fight alone alongside his family. Of course, the whale comes to the rescue, but that's practically all because Eywa (the All-Mother/Great Mother) does not help this time.Summary: Save money and don't waste your time!"
"It's been 13 years since James Cameron last dazzled the world with his epic sci-fi fantasy that not only became the highest-grossing film of all time but still remains the holy-grail of 3D cinema. And finally, after a decade of expanding the mythology of Pandora on paper & helping develop the technology needed to adapt his vision on screen, the King of Hollywood at long last makes his much-awaited return to his throne and instantly lets his presence felt & importance known to everyone by reminding all what a larger-than-life extravaganza should look & feel like.Avatar: The Way of Water is a worthy sequel that both improves upon the original and also feels slightly inferior to it. With there being a long gap between the two releases, Cameron opts for a plot that isn't just familiar but is also recycled & reworked into an epic family saga. Full of callbacks & references that reacquaints the viewers with what's happened before, this follow-up story still packs ample heart & enough substance to stand on its own and the cinematic wizardry on display is a strong reminder that the visionary filmmaker is still unrivalled when it comes to redefining big-screen experiences."
Real dissapointment. Characters have no differentiation or depth at all. Action scenes are just too crowded and unrelenting. The overloaded 'I see you' references are beyond cringe. Cameron trying to ram home importance of family and parenting is as subtle as a slegehammer. Felt like Avatar fused with Watereworld. Too many writers and editors on this project felt both under and overcooked. The villain was too much of a parody. The references to terraforming and amrita go nowhere. The whole endeavour seemed like a cynical throughput to the next few films. Genuinely shocked to see so many gushing reviews over this film.
"So, this sequel which we finally got after 13 years tells us of Jake and his family being threatened and forced to relocate to a society living by the ocean. Yeah, James Cameron literally journeyed to the deepest ocean in the world so there's literally no one better to make a movie about the ocean than this. My biggest problem with the first movie was how lame the villain was. This movie brought him back by saying his memories were uploaded into a Navi body. Well, I think it's actually more like a clone. He outright says he isn't the exact same person.Honestly, he kind of got better here. My main complaint is of course that it's too long. You could easily cut half an hour and it's especially noticeable in the middle part. Anyway, I was glad to have seen this in IMax and 3D, as that's truly the best way to see it. It was extremely creative to see the ocean and the wild life. I really did like how protective Jake was of his kids and it seemed like a big transition for him. ***"
"""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is an Action - Fantasy movie and the sequel of ""Avatar"", in which we watch Jake Sully living with his family in the moon Pandora sixteen years after the events of the first movie when something will interrupt his life and soon enough he with the help of Neytiri and the Na'vi army will have to protect their home.Since I had already watched and enjoyed the first movie of the franchise I was already expecting its sequel for a lot of time. I had high expectations from this movie and fortunately I was not disappointed by it. The direction which was made for one more time by James Cameron was simply exceptional and his work was obvious through the whole duration of the film. The plot was simple and at some points predictable but I enjoyed it and I found it interesting, too since James Cameron presented something new regarding Pandora and Na'vi in general. To sum up, I have to say that ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is an amazing movie and I am sure that if you have already watched and enjoyed the first movie then you will simply love this one, too."
"This is the first film after which I felt I had to write a review to confirm how bad it is. Visually stunning of course, but it's like watching a nature film, which I'm not that interested in, given that it's about a fictional world. The story was dumb, predictable and full of plot holes. Jake Sully and his family reminded me of the ""7th Heaven"" TV series (I wanted to write ""This is Us"", but I don't want to mislead anyone that Avatar 2 would be on the same level): portrayal of a strong family with minor and major dramas, filled with moral lessons, but for some reason the protagonist of Avatar makes irrational decisions. I didn't care about the fate of the characters, I wasn't moved at all and if they had 2 hours more screen time, it wouldn't change. Beautiful film, but most boring film of my life."
"I love movies, and I watched the sequel to Avatar without knowing anything about it.The story begins, ready we go, and already comes the first message: to save the family you have to escape.All the while clones (avatars) of dead characters and children whose origin is unknown (holy spirit?) are introduced.The central part of the film unfolds through a National Geographic-like narrative, to climax with stretches of Aliens and Titanic.Mind you, here comes the educational message again: to save themselves, the big fish, they must escape.Moving on...
After two hours of film finally comes a spectacular, engaging and, at times, thrilling finale.Technically perfect film, I dare not imagine the difficulties in shooting it, with excellent performances by the actors (see Kate Winslet's almost 7 minutes in apnea).I liked the inclusion in the soundtrack of a song from memory by James Horner (RIP).Probably the best CGI movie I have ever seen, but it is not enough to be a great movie.I honestly do not understand the time it took, it was announced as far back as 2009, to write it through no less than 4 scripts.Where is the story?Happy viewing to all
Paolo."
"This movie is basically the set up for the next two. We all know that. Its not an organically developed movie, its intention is to grab your attention and make you want to watch the following movies too. As such it was always going to leave many questions unanswered.Many people are impressed with the effects. I'm not, particularly. We know this technology exists. We've seen its like before. The world they have created is beautiful for sure. It draws you in. Its breathtaking in places. The imagination required to create the creatures etc is amazing. But we expected all that. Thats what this movie is. Thats what the first one was. This is largely more of the same.I found the jump from the last movie to this one, in terms of story, a little jarring. That said I very quickly grew to like to characters, predictable as some of the character developments are.It rolls along and certainly pulls at the heart strings in places.It is a bit slow paced, but I liked that. More time to enjoy the scenery. I enjoyed the story telling aspect. I liked the fact it had the time to simply let us watch things, like a creature swimming, without the need to rush off and cram more complex story in.All in all I thought it was great. For me, job done, I can't wait to see the next one, and the one after that, and the one after then, and so on."
Saw the movie in 3d high frame rate. As the first avatar the 3D is very well done. But I'm definitely not a fan of the high frame rate. I knew this beforehand but still gave it a shot since I wanted to experience the movie how the director intended to show it.The high frame rate makes the scenes look like a game and a lot less like a movie. Also some camera movements feel too gamy. Usually the wide shots with a quick zoom-in do that. Not a fan of it.Not all the scenes are in high frame rate. I definitely liked those better. Unfortunately you can also notice the difference between HFR and non-HFR in the grading (colors) of the movie. The HFR scenes seem like showing too much contrast.Other then disliking the HFR I think it was a great movie. Specially if you appreciate the visually stunning world that has been created. The movie became more pleasant the moment the water world was introduced. It also pulled away my attention from the game like feeling a bit. I also liked the story although a bit thin. It's more about the experience and about family. I wish James Cameron would remove the gamy feeling of the movie for the upcoming sequels because I'm definitely still a fan of Avatar!
"Huge Avatar 1 fan here. Waited 13 years for the sequel and I am extremely disappointed. Seen the first movie over 100 times and used to sleep to the soundtrack. Went to film school because I was so deeply impacted by the first movie as an adolescent.If you like to look at pretty pictures for over 3hrs this film is for you. Otherwise the story has many plot holes, written like a film student and feels bloated and yet empty at the same time. Cameron treats the audience like they are stupid and fills it with endless exposition. Have some faith the audience can infer what is going on.The villain is horrible. Should have left him in the first movie. The little Tarzan kid is horrible and cringey.Amazing actors in this movie that seem like beginners. Obviously because they were given nothing to work with and a poor script. In a recent interview with James Cameron he said the reason it took so long was because of the script and not technology. So why is the story so bad? Inexcusable with this amount of time and resources.So many wasted opportunities to create a visual masterpiece and an incredible story. Seems like he did the first movie with heart and the second with the intention of making money.Extremely saddened by this. I wish I liked it."
"Not long back from the cinema, so impressions are relatively fresh.I recall enjoying the original Avatar, but will admit that it was long enough ago that my memory of any of the detail is somewhat hazy. That said, it didn't seem like there was much requirement for me to have refreshed before seeing the movie as a decent amount is rehashed.The movie felt long at more than 3hrs, particularly since it didn't seem like there was enough story to really justify that runtime - it was more a case of extending the amount of showcasing of beautiful CGI scenery (which is admittedly very well done).Regarding the story, it did feel like there was a lot of repetition - I lost count of the number of times kids/villagers were taken hostage, (with very few consequences when their demands were just ignored) or kids were reprimanded by their parents for misbehaving.The showing I was at was 3D - if I'm honest I didn't feel like it made much difference to the experience, albeit it was just a normal screen rather than IMAX, so possible that may improve it somewhat. For context, I saw Top Gun: Maverick in 2D on a similar screen & thought it was as immersive, possibly even moreso.Overall, I enjoyed the film well enough, but think it was overly long & lacking in substance meaning that I am unlikely to rewatch and will think carefully about whether it's worth seeing Avatar 3 in the cinema when that is eventually released."
"I'll try to keep my review brief but it is a movie over 3h long.Positive:
CGI and all of the underwater sequences looked fantastic, as they should considering the effort put into them.Introduction of the sea life was superior to the first movie, as in they felt more realistic and less shiny or rigid.This was awesome 3D and really enhanced the underwater elements beautifully. Even when bullets were flying towards you they didn't blur or anything like that.Negatives:lack of progression in the story. It really was basically a rehash of the first movie. It skipped over bits in the story which would have been far better explored than what we got.the characters. Jake and Ney'tiri were really just bland in this movie. Jake was just a soldier who seemed to complained at his kids or was grovelling. Ney'tiri was either angry or sad. I'm not sure if either of them smiled all movie or had any real meaningful moment that was spent so long developed in the first. There were far too many characters to either keep track of or truly care about because again, they skipped over it for the revenge storyline. Kiri, Lo'ak and Neteyam were my favourites of the kids. I truly have no idea why they added Tuk or Spider into the mix, they really didn't add any substance.character development. They were developing Kiri's storyline nicely and then it just fizzled out and became nonsensical. They showed her with her mum but then she left really easily. She started to have seizures but magically all good. Really annoying as I thought something interesting was going to eventuate. Lo'ak was well developed for a one-dimensional character, but again, we've already had this storyline in Jake. Neteyam I thought might be the true leader coming through and even developed his storyline to be maybe something of Jake's brother where he was a scientist who was interested in exploring, was really levelheaded but then has the leadership qualities of Jake and Ney'tiri. But they just sort of killed him off because the good guys needed to lose someone. Kill off spider or Tuk, that would have made more sense to me. The also kept setting Spider up with something with his dad but that just fizzled out and he didn't confront Jake or Ney'tiri about killing his dad. It would have made more sense if Spider had killed him.Completely under-utilised previous characters for anything meaningful again. Because it's just a revenge movie, they didn't provide any substance.The Metkayina people were one dimensional too, although very well created. They were just character copies of the Navi.What really bothered me was how easy the marines were comfortable with the environment and bonded with the animals. I wish after Spider's speech about doing bonding traditionally that he would have still darted it.The whole ""ambergris"" dumb storyline and stupid characters. Why did the pilot and crew wear sunglasses when all the instrumentation was digital and screens? Eh.Anyway, there's other minor negative reasons too but they're just finer detail things. After seeing this movie, I wish it had come out in 2014 like originally planned and that we saw the chapter before this one. You know that this really is a middle movie that it just feels like filler. I did expect more from JC."
"I have this problem.. I think about the movie I saw for about a week later. Re-examining plots, looking for holes, inconsistencies. Did the writers cover all the bases, or leave air gaps? How were we fooled? That sort of thing. If I feel like I was felt up at the drive-in, then that's a fail. This one unfortunately qualifies as a feel up. The other reviews give all the specifics, I won't repeat them all here. Cameron & Co just pushed this too far. Ever been to a Steven Seagal movie? Remember how he lectures you in the movie? Cameron is doing that again, but now brings in whaling as another lecture. There was no reference to Un-obtanium this time. Now the whalers were looking for $80M vials of whales brain fluid, that stops men from aging?? Whaaaa? Wait, hold up. Where was that going, and it's never mentioned again. The earth is dying, and now Pandora is the new intended home? Wahhh? Hold up. What' happening to the earth and why is Pandora the new home? What happened to un-obtanium? Why is Jake (who apparently had a fake body avatar made w a functioning reproductive system) moving to the reef with his family after being the #1 leader of the forest people? Oh, to avoid a war against him and whacking the forest people. So he's willing to sacrifice the reef people I guess. They have an adopted daughter that apparently was created by the glowing tree, using Grace as the mommy.. Whaaaa? The Colonel was also re-created because he backed up his system on a usb drive allowing a transfer of his memories to a new avatar. That's a nice feature. How come no one else who died had backups? They made it sound so routine. In theory, every dead person should have an avatar backup. And avatars can be killed easily with an arrow or a karate chop, but underwater they can't be drowned. Just pull them to the surface and you're good to go...Oh boy."
"Long awaited sequel to the highest grossest film of all time finds Jake Sully and his Na'vi family having to leave the forest for a reef community that exists in and around the sea. Years have past since the first film and with Earth decaying, aggressive plans are advancing to take over Pandora as well as seeking revenge on Jake from his actions from the first episode. Whilst at their new settlement they learn the ways of the water which will help them as the human aggressors approach.As with 'Avatar' Cameron has produced another stunningly beautiful epic full of the most glorious ideas as the family learn about life in the sea. Clearly this film carries a very heartfelt eco message and it is unlikely that you'll come out of seeing this unmoved by its ideas and spectacle. It could, I think be argued that it it is a little too long with sometimes too much time devoted to blue people smiling at glowing fish etc and the principal villain Quaritch, growling about Sully a bit too much. That said it's a glorious piece of cinema, which I saw in IMAX 3D and which I would encourage you to do, with the last 45 minutes being one of the most exciting pieces of film you'll have seen on a screen for some time."
"Dear James- since I can't get my money back, I want the three hours I wasted on your screen saver with bad dialogue back instead. To the reader, I wouldn't waste your time or brain cells, this movie will make you dummer while fooling you with extensive CGI visuals. The storyline of this movie couldn't have perpetuated more negative stereotypes if it had tried. The plot was predictable, one dimensional, disconnected, and flimsy. First and foremost is the utterly predictable and painfully one dimensional Sully family dynamic punctuated by a stereo-typical level of family discipline reminiscent of the 1950s. Second, is the utter over simplistic view of indigenous people as primitive ideologues. Third is the equally over simplistic view of Marines as murderous brutes devoid of dialogue that exceeds two syllables. The majority of this film consisted of stunning, imaginary visuals that were punctuated by dialogue and attempts at weaving bad plot lines into a story. If you want to enjoy the visuals, listen to a podcast, listen to a book, or do something else to occupy the intelligent parts of your brain while your eyes are occupied. Better yet, turn it on when you can stream it from home, mute it, and skip around the parts that aren't CGI immersive alien aquarium views. The visuals would make a great update to my screen saver for my 1990s Macintosh. In fact, watching a screen saver of fake marine life for 3 hours would be more intellectually stimulating and less insulting to the viewer, sentient creatures, and people in general. Finally, how can anyone make a movie about life of a Marine, dealing with stereotypical (utterly unrealistic) Marine family life, inter-personal Marine drama, based in a marine scene and leave out crayons?"
"Technical aspect is around 10, movie is near zero. Got good seat in 3D theather, but it did not help because story is bad in the worst way possible. I think i got brain damage from the story and lost the hope that James Cameron could do good movie anymore. Wont be going to avatar 3 if there is one, atleast when when watching in home i could skip some parts, get painkillers or get drunk. Cameron should have done the Battle Angels, wtf he has been doing past 13 years. Some water scenes are amazing, but i could have watched only them and skipped the rest of the movie. I honestly feel i should go poison the ocean and water sources so nobody needs to watch this."
"Well, this movie is a good way to show how technology could create such astonishing experience for human eyes. It was like watching the rest of the Himalayas from the top of the Everest mountain so I'm giving 10/10 for visuals.The story however showed how Hollywood could underestimate human brain and insult intelligence. It wasn't any better than recent creepy thrashy Bruce Willis movies. I just dont understand anymore why they presume that such cliche scenarios would sell. Well, 350 M and you created and amazing beautiful astonishing but dumb movie. So 2/10.Sum up and divide by half would give my overall opinion."
"The story of the movie revolves around the family of Jake who is trying to survive being attacked by sky people.A father, A mother, kids who are dealing with their teenage problems and understanding their identity...
On the other side, there are Sky people who want Pandora at any cost. Even if they lose several times. The basic premise of the story sounds so basic, but the visual treat and direction of this movie are so well executed.Direction: James Cameron knows directing a story in such a way that people will love to see the journey of each character and the way he creates a beautiful world around the characters.Writing: Another reason Avatar 2 is a well-made movie is that the director is also a writer of this epic. When any writer directs his project, he knows what he wants. Pandora's future is Amazing.Cinematography: Soul of the project. Avatar is always well known for its visual effects, even its CGI or Motion Capture. I can understand how challenging it is to visualize the scripts and shoot raw footage with perfect lights and frames. So hats off to this department.Music and sound design: so soothing. So beautiful. The pandora theme or when the characters dive into the water for the first time or when the battle begins. You pick up any scene and it's so well-created sound effects. So good.VFX: Perfect Perfect Perfect. Who am I even to talk about this?"
"While the stunning visuals of this film are definitely worth praising, the overall plot left much to be desired. It ultimately falls short as a meaningful cinematic experience and is more focused on spectacle than substance, which was a shame because the potential for a great narrative was there. The soundtrack also fell flat, with none of the tracks standing out as particularly memorable. To make matters worse, some segments of the film felt more like a National Geographic documentary than a fully-fledged feature film. Not interested to see the sequels at all no matter how big and extensive the advertising campaigns may be."
"Avatar (2009) is the most popular movie that no one remembers. Personally I was not a big fan of the first part. It was definitely a visual delight but I never re-visited the movie again.Due to its massive success, a sequel was inevitable. The Way of Water delivers on the visual front; with beautiful landscapes, creatures, characters (now with better VFX!) and more. It is clear that James Cameron wanted to focus on the world building, allowing some scenes to even feel documentary-like. But this is not a documentary, the story and characters are responsible for keeping me engaged and sitting in my seat for 3 hours and 15 mins.I found myself bored through several sequences, not really caring for the protagonist and his family (as much as they wanted me to). The 4 stars out of 10 are all credited to the VFX team, concept artists and stunt coordinators. I would not recommend the film if you felt so-so about the first one too. If you're a fan of Avatar and its world you will enjoy the film, but if you're like me, you will find yourself bored and checking your watch for when the 3 hour marathon will end."
"Currently in cinemas is the return of the blue furry cats from director James Cameron. Taking place nearly 20 years after the events of the original w/the Navi happily living their best lives but then the pesky humans come back, w/a slew of the deceased marines (now inhabiting avatars which they downloaded their consciousness into) ready to retake what's theirs, especially after the military general, played by Edie Falco, states the Earth is dead for its inhabitants, so all bets are off. Focusing on getting a hold of the Sully family w/their 3 hybrid kids along w/Sigourney Weaver's daughter (w/her playing the part) who's birth father at this point is unknown & a human baby boy left behind during the original's Terran exodus which they raise as their own. Formidable enough to send the Scullys fleeing from their tree habitat, they soon lose themselves in a cluster of islands to hide among the sea Navi who take them in as their own (as long as they learn their ways) which opens up the bulk of the middle section of the film as the kids relearn their skill sets w/Weaver's daughter particularly adept at the new setting (setting up a mystical connection future films will probably explore). As the pursuing Marines close the gap in finding the Scullys, partnered w/the human boy who was captured in an early melee (& turns out to be Stephen Lang's son), future installments are well stocked & set up w/lives lost on both sides. Ambitious, even for typical Cameron standards, to the extreme w/world building (quite literally!) to span across another 3 films can be daunting for a mere mortal but Cameron who has surrounded himself w/at least 5 other writers are making this franchise something that will give Star Wars & the MCU a run for its money (again breaking records w/the fastest film reaching a billion dollars already) & other than some details brought up quickly & glossed over (perhaps something that'll be fleshed out later), the film is still a marvel to behold & entertaining to boot."
"The CGI and 3D experience is utterly amazing! So was the sound editing. This made some of the scenes extraordinary.However, there were some downsides too:
Firstly, I found the story somewhat repetitive. At some points it was a bit slow-paced and I wanted the story to progress.Secondly, the 1st movie is very original in terms of the script and characters. I found the 2nd movie less so.Thirdly, the movie is more than three hours long, yet not long enough the get me invested in the characters. It took some time to sort out the characters and what their purpose was, and I lost my investment in the characters from the 1st movie. Sadly, I experienced less sentiment in this movie.In other words, this was more an experience than a movie to me."
"Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana are back as the leads. As their characters have matured and how they now have in the four children, one adopted named Miles but he is called Spider there. With him playing on such a very crucial role there.But when the so called Sky people that have in the mercenaries and in the ex-military attack their once peaceful existence there and they have to flee over.For that Sam and Zoe characters have to make a very huge adjustment to water hence the title there. As they are greet with curiosity, disdain, and amusement there. By those that look like them but only a little lighter.Like in the trying to get used to the water in which in real life the actors had to undergo underwater training and deep sea diving there.Just when you think that the main antagonist Stephen Lang is killed, well think again. As he is back. The villain you love to loathe there.Hope that characters like Norman Spellman will get a better and bigger role there in the next few sequels. So far so good."
"Let me start right away by saying I loved this movie so much that I saw it twice in the same week. The first time was a large curved screen, and both my wife and I came out just plain saying ""Wow!"" A few days later I went and saw it again, this time on 3D IMAX, and I have to say my mind was utterly blown by the experience! James Cameron is kind of famous for inventing new tech that makes his movie incredible. For example, he sponsored the invention of new kinds of diving gear to make The Abyss, tech that was so good that the mainstream diving industry adopted the designs (I am a former scuba instructor and we all talked about his amazing inventions). He also was one of the first directors to adopt the newer forms of 3D for his original Avatar movie n 2009. Well let me say that the advancements forward since 2009 in 3D have never been show in as utterly spectacular a light as in ""Avatar: The Way Of The Water."" No matter that I had just seen the film a few days prior. No matter that the film is about 3 hours long. The 3D IMAX experience was Soooo Good that I felt like I was watching a Whole New Movie! And in fact I was so completely enthralled and blown away by how gorgeous this film is in 3D IMAX that it did not even feel like 3 hours at all. To call this film in 3D IMAX ""Amazing"" would be a gross understatement. This is Fantasy Film Making at its absolute finest. Give yourself a real treat and see this movie. And if you can, give yourself a serious gift and see it in 3D IMAX. That 3D IMAX ticket cost me $25 and it was Worth Every Penny!!"
"The graphs are gorgeous, the underwaterworld is a world on it's own, just like the forests of Pandora. However, Cameron mentions that this film has unexpected twists and I have to disagree with him. Once shown you will immediatly know that Kiri's bond with nature will help in the end. You will know that the banned Tulkun will come to the rescue.I'm also a little bit confused by the Tarzan resemblence with Spider and Tuk. Is it intentional? Did it just randomly happen that they have similar looks and names? I feel like that storyline with his dad was so short compared to the others that Spiders actions become unexplainable. They could have shown more of the complexity of that bond.All in all a beuatiful film, glad I've seen it, but storyline unfortunately more of the same."
"Well we ought not to have expected ""Jake"" (Sam Worthington) and ""Neytiri"" (Zoe Saldana) to have let the grass grow during the intervening years since we were first introduced to the idyllic world of ""Pandora"". Now with four children and their human friend ""Spider"" (Jack Champion - remember Johnny Sheffield?), they are living life to the full. Until, that is, one night they see a new star in the sky. Star? Well, no - it's the ships announcing the return of the human beings, this time even more bent on the conquest of their planet now that the Earth is finally on it's knees. Armed to the hilt with the latest technology and weaponry, and commanded by the essence of the departed ""Col. Quaritch"" - who also now leads a squad of Na'vi-esque avatars of his own - things look ominous for the ""Sully"" family. Realising that they are front and centre for their persecutors, they relocate to (saddle themselves on) a remote, water-based community where they hope, rather unrealistically, to be able to sit it out... This is undoubtedly a beautiful piece of cinema to watch. 3D and IMAX with a classily crafted score from Simon Franglen and a message that trumpets the cruciality of the symbiotic relationships between all creatures that live on a world where co-operation and understanding are vital to the survival of all. Thing is, though, that all of that glorious cinematography starts to get just a bit repetitive after about an hour and the middle portion of this really does drag. Indeed, were this to have been a long ""Blue Planet"" style documentary alerting us to the dangers of mankind's rampant abuse of resources with scant regard to the implications for any other species, then I would have enjoyed it better in three parts with Sir David Attenborough's mellifluous narration. It isn't though, and the story is stretched so terribly thinly that - sorry, sacrilege I know - I was actually bored a bit. It does pick up for the last forty minutes or so as the denouement provides for loads of action-packed pyrotechnics but to be honest, I had sort of lost interest by that point. Certainly, it is a great looking film that offers us food for thought, but as a story - I thought it weak, predictable and at times it does just a little too much of it's own recycling. Indeed - had their children actually done what they were told in the first place, there might not have been much of a story at all! Essential on a big screen."
"Yes. Visually the movie is striking. Beautiful colors, believable sea creatures, what not. The Maguffin as Hitchcock called it is weak and not explained well at all. In the first movie at least humanity needed some sort of mineral. Now it's a kind of whale oil that will guarantee immortality to humans. Ridiculous. Sigourney Weaver reprises her role as an avatar but you'd hardly know it. I hate the way the kids talk to each other. Right out of today's high school. I understand Sigourney wanted it this way. Ridiculous. The basic problem, other than the Navi are just butt ugly, is that you don't care about any of the characters.. Just like to first movie, there is not a single memorable line the whole movie. And they are making a third one! Go figure."
"I went to theater to watch this in immersive 3D but came out disappointed. Not what I was expecting. Besides 1-hour full packed action scene everything else is just one huge encouragement of family values. If I wanted to watch some mediocratic family soap opera, I would have gone to see Home Alone, Frozen, Harry Potter or something else. Far away from being good as first part. Don't trust me, just look at the ratings. Effects are stunning though and general story line as well. But I don't understand why every darn 5 minutes has to have some family moments in the movie. I'm going to skip theater next time when Avatar 3 come out."
"While beautiful graphics in theory could compensate for a recyclement of the first movie's story, massive plotholes and an outright complete lack of any character development whatsoever, this round of Avatar unfortunately falls short in every department. Yes, some scenes when it is wet look great, but far too much praise of the film's beauty is centered around its rendering pipeline. In fact, the world building, animals and even the sea avatars are visally very boring and at many instances look like an overexposed NFT project. The whales on Pandora look like and behave like whales on earth, everything glows for no reason and the haka tribe sea Avatars look like they got their face markings by shopping for temporary tattoos in the dollar store. Avoid this movie."
"Visually amazing, definitely need to see it in the big screen in 3D. But there is no way that I was interested enough to even consider watching it again.Very poor writing, 1D characters, predictable, too long. Why are the aliens, basically Indians? Why are the humans thought less invaders only interesting in fighting? Surely they had time and money to get some decent writers to work on this thing.Apparently the story line is the same as the first one, but I forgot what happened in that one. What happened in this one was largely forgettable as well. But at least it looked good.After 13 years it is clear they spent all that time on the visuals and child with a crayon wrote the script during their lunch break."
"After 13 years, Avatar finally received a sequel. Just like Aliens and Terminator 2, The Way of Water is another James Cameron sequel better than the first movie.Visually, The Way of Water is better than its predecessor. I already thought the visuals in the re-release of Avatar still held up, but the sequel surpassed it. The CGI in this movie looks absolutely beautiful. I can imagine The Way of Water will still look great years later.Another improvement over the first movie is the characters. For the old cast, I thought Jake Sully, Neytiri, and Quaritch were more interesting here. I liked the new family dynamic Jake and Neytiri have with their children. While Neytiri got sidelined for most of the movie, the death of her oldest son making her more brutal was a compelling direction for her character that hopefully gets explored more in future sequels. For Quaritch, I liked that he was more involved in the story this time.Besides the old characters getting improved, I liked most of the new cast as well. I liked Lo'ak's relationship with the whale, though I thought his crush with the water village girl could've been more developed. For Kiri, even though Sigourney Weaver was playing a teenage girl, I didn't find it distracting at all. Jake and Neytiri's youngest daughter, Tuk, could've easily been annoying, but surprisingly, I wasn't bothered by her character. With Spider, I liked him until he made a choice towards the end of the movie I'll discuss later.For issues, my biggest complaint is the Way of Water's pacing. This is the only aspect the first movie is better at. Even though Avatar is a long movie, I never felt it was too long. With this movie, I can feel its runtime, particularly in the middle, where Jake Sully's family is adjusting to their new life in the water village, and the final battle.Besides the final battle going on a little too long, I also have issues with other moments in the third act. I already mentioned Jake and Neytiri's oldest son dying, but that scene would've been more impactful if he had more to do in the movie. While Lo'ak and Kiri had plenty of development, the oldest son got sidelined. Another issue I have is Spider rescuing Quaritch. I know Quaritch is his father, but he just killed Jake's oldest son, someone that Spider grew up with. While Spider's decision bothered me, I have a feeling this might be setting up a redemption arc for Quaritch in future movies.A small nitpick I have is with the high frame rate. I only noticed this during a couple of action scenes, but when I did, it distracted me. It felt like those scenes were being fast-forwarded.Overall, The Way of Water is a long-awaited sequel that mostly delivers. While I have issues with the pacing and some of the moments in the third act, I liked the characters and the visuals. I give The Way of Water an 8/10."
"Visually stunning. Incredible world building. But that's it. The entire premise of the movie is nonsensical and idiotic. The plot is slow, boring, or just flat out absent for long stretches throughout the movie. I really wanted to keep an open mind after not loving the first Avatar... and yet this one was worse. I think I'm done with this franchise.I won't include any spoilers, but there were quite a few things that happened in the movie that were either not explained well or just made no sense. And after a one-dimensional villain in the first Avatar... I don't know, I guess I was hoping for a more compelling antagonist this time around. But nope."
"Physically painful to watch if you love animals. Would not recommend to any one, who has at least one ounce of sympathy. First hour is watchable, second hour of the movie needs to be cut out of existence, and the third is bearable. Every sad moment is soooo accentuated, shown in smallest details. Movie plot is somewhat okay, some moments are questionable, some plain stupid. The ending deserves its own award. Don't understand how a sane person can see evil in another, yet save him from death. Not even thinking about consequences, betraying all his friends. As said before- too much violence. Would not recommend."
"In the 13 years since James Cameron wowed audiences everywhere with ""Avatar,"" then promised an imminent sequel, the question has turned from when we might see said sequel to whether or not we'd actually want to. In the intervening years, even as Cameron updated his plans for the sci-fi spectacle and teased bold new advances in filmmaking technology to make his follow-up movie, people began asking if anyone still cared about the ""Avatar"" world that took the all-time box office crown back in 2009. No matter the filmmaking force of Cameron, or the ensemble cast he built, or the stunning visuals he crafted, the doubts persisted. They persist even now, with just days to go until the sequel is finally released.But few filmmakers in history have ever been able to manage spectacle, expectation, and pure craft quite like James Cameron, the Oscar-winning mind behind ""Avatar,"" ""Titanic,"" ""Aliens,"" and more. Even when the deck is stacked against him, Cameron seems to be able to overcome the odds through pure, ineffable movie magic. It's fitting, then, that ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is the story of a family overcoming the odds to keep fighting, and that Cameron has poured an entire decade of energy and cinematic inertia into telling that story. So put aside your doubts, because one of cinema's great blockbuster artists is back, and he's delivered a film so packed with spectacle that even the original ""Avatar"" pales in comparison.Just as much time has passed in the world of the films as in our real world when ""The Way of Water"" opens, which means Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and his wife Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) have spent the last decade-plus living in relative peace, building a family in the forests of Pandora that includes sons Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton), daughter Tuk (Trinity Jo-Li Bliss), and adopted daughter Kiri (Sigourney Weaver).But the peace can't last. A new human invasion force has arrived on Pandora, including the revived Avatar form of Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang), Jake's mortal enemy from the first film, who will stop at nothing to kill Jake and his entire family, even if it means burning the entire forest to the ground. So, Jake and Neytiri reluctantly pack up their kids and flee their home in favor of Pandora's oceans, where they must learn a new way of life among the reef clans, and pray that Quaritch doesn't find them.With a runtime stretching to more than three hours, Cameron makes sure to pack much more plot into ""The Way of Water"" than this basic arc, from the inclusion of a strange human stray who runs with the Sully children to the culture and rituals of the reef clans themselves. It's a dense film, packed with story and worldbuilding, but there's also a sense that Cameron is taking some extra space to luxuriate in is world this time around. The first ""Avatar"" had the advantage of using Jake as a point-of-view character, a human in a Na'vi body discovering the wonders of Pandora for the first time. In ""The Way of Water,"" through the Sully children, we get to experience that again as they learn what an entirely different ecosystem on their planet looks and feels like, and it's even more wondrous than the first film.This is thanks, in part, to advances in the technology used to render Pandora as realistically as possible, which gives us jaw-dropping shots of strange alien whales moving through oceans, and stunning details like the way CGI feet move in sand or the way water drips off a lock of hair. But this isn't just a movie generated by computers. Cameron's steady, often whimsical hand is at play in every shot, as he frames the wonderland of Pandora with the skill of a master, building all the necessary pieces for the dramatic arc of this film, then setting them firmly in place for a third act that then explodes all of it in a dazzling showcase of action that rivals just about anything he's ever done anywhere else in his career. The first two-thirds of the film will leave you in awe, but the last third will blow you through the back wall of the theater.All this, plus a renewed focus on the potential emotional depth in the story, and the earnestness of the ensemble cast led by Worthington and Weaver, makes ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" a truly awe-inspiring time at the movies. It's a film that was very much worth the wait, and a reminder that James Cameron remains a blockbuster icon."
"After longtime waiting just i had watched in theatre..A protogonist and his family went to a new avatar village for save his family from antogonist...
But they find out and came to fight as avatars and those village people and creatures help them to save..
Finally they killed bad people and return to their old village..
Visually great treat for us we couldnt find any flaws in it..
But normal script this wont expect from James Cameron..
But anyway must watch thriller...After longtime waiting just i had watched in theatre..A protogonist and his family went to a new avatar village for save his family from antogonist...

"This movie has so many shortcomings, only dumos and children can ignore!! But visually very good, parents can watch this movie with kids for light entertainment.Firstly, why avatars are five fingered! Didn't humen know the locals are with four!! How did they miss that😮
Second, the colonel is resurrected with a purpose to kill the Navi leader. But Jake didn't know that, despite Jake selfishly fled away leaving his clan depending on a guess.Then Jake went to an area of thousands of islands. But among thousands why had he chosen the island, where the Leader's wife is hostile?Next, story shows Tulkun Payakan is a good soul with good intentions. But the first thing it did, killed an own kind to save a Navi child!! Other funny fact is Payakan knows hand gesture sign language without having any hand😄. Moreover A Tulkun can connect with local people, but not with its own kind!At the end Payakan took revenge by disarming the killer was hilarious.There are a lot of factors which makes this movie childish. So, infact the Avatar2 is a dish for children.."
"Avatar - The Way Of WaterTotally Brilliant, an absolute must see in 3D 4DX for the full immersive experience. At a whopping three hours and 12 minutes long, it was totally gripping from start to finish.Mr Cameron took his time from the start to meticulously, develop the new characters and scenarios on Pandora. Nothing was left to chance and everything was intentional. The story was delivered slowly with some episodic breaks for character development, but the overarching story all came together in the denouement.The 3-D was perfection, personified, I was totally blown away by the end result.Without doubt you do have to be a fantasy fan to enjoy Avatar, It's not everyone's cup of tea! However, to true aficionados this movie delivered in spades I couldn't recommend it moreI am giving this a full 10 out of 10 despite some imperfections and a few contrivances."
"I LOVED EVERY SECOND OF IT. A lot of people complained that the movie was slow and things not happening fast but what is the point of things happening fast if they are not gonna take their time to show all the beauty of the new planet Pandora. Everything was so beautiful, I wanted to be there, interact with them, be happy like them. Loved their daily lives, how they played, how they flew. And the emotions the characters showed were so beautiful, especially the one of the mother. I love that mother, her feelings, her crying, so emotionally charged. The movie literally made me cry and freeze in the theater.100 Recommend it!!!"
"The graphics in this movie is really fantastic. And that's about the only good thing I can say about the second Avatar movie.Compared to the first movie, which I loved, the second Avatar movie is like a kids movie with bad acting. The story is extremely flat and the characters motives are either non-existent or just not believable at all.Instead of the movie playing out in a magical forest, they leave their home and all of their friends for no good reason and become ""water people"". Sure the surroundings were pretty cool for 5 minutes, but it gets old pretty fast. And they couldn't even come up with a new, or at least believable, bad guy. I don't even have the energy to list all of the things that don't make sense in this movie.I can't believe that I waited 12 years to watch the sequel, but what's worse is that James Cameron spent 12 years making this movie. He watch the finished product and was proud enough to share that crap with the rest of the world."
"And sceneries. And flying and swimming monsters, And the terrific fights and struggles between groups. And the constant violent action sometimes beautiful. And the Na'vi faces. The story is simple: JackSully is in the Pandora planet where the Na'vi race lives and gets a new family there but has got to face opposition and must enter the local fights which most of them take place in the sea or a river (The Water Way) The visual and special effects are great and keep our atttention deeply all the time. Just for this shape and aspect this movie is worth to be seen. It is extremely enjoyable. It keeps us stuck to the seat with a busy look."
"I went in skeptical because I usually have low expectations of sequels. Sequels usually disappoint more than satisfy. Since so much of the talk around the film surrounded about the technical feats and cgi, i was like uh-oh. But its the week before Christmas, why not.The story, although not original, it is very well put together. While the main story is about revenge and conquer. The film has many familial side stories that really made the film interesting to me. For me, it wasn't about the CGI. What won me over was the father-son dynamic between Jake and Quaritch's sons. It had conflicts and almost redemption. A unspoken attachment bond between father and son that is almost absent in today's modern Hollywood. Famly bonds between siblings too. The problems of fitting in to a new society when Jake's family self excile from the forest to live with the Neytiri to prevent further harm to the Navi people.Yeah, its the side stories in this film that really make it good. No, its not all original. Its a Native American vs US Cavary film we have seen over and over but wrapped in a Sci-Fi world. But it's so well put together that I didn't mind. What makes this film good isn't the CGI, its the multiple side stories within it. This makes it better than the original and will probably stand up against time as there are lots of thematic ideas about a person's role and responsibilities in society and family. This film can easily be watched a few times and we can pick up something new with each viewing.So yes, it was worth the 3.5 hour run time because it had very little filler and lots of story. I feel I got my money's worth at the box office."
"Too many reviews have covered the bases and probably more eloquently than I.In short;
Does it look pretty? Yes, stunningly so.Is that enough in itself? NoThe story is bland and highly repetitive to the first film with more plot holes than a Swiss cheese (don't get me started on Colonel Miles Quaritch's return). There are large drops in frame rates when there's too much CGI.Eight of us (all fans of the first film) went to see it and we spent longer than the film itself discussing all the ""issues"" we had with it afterwards.Watch it? Sure, why not.Revisit it? No
Eagerly await the next one? Not a chance."
"Wow, where do I even begin?Another masterpiece that makes you marvel again at the wonders of life, nature, emotions, imagination and thought-provoking complex themes about relationships all of which testify to the signs shown to us by our absolute creator.This film left me with a mix of emotions that I am still trying to process. On one hand, I was in awe of how James beautifully explores the deep, emotional bond that connects spiritual beings with nature. On the other hand, the troubling ways in which man can sometimes damage or neglect those connections for greed or vengeance.Overall, this film left me feeling deeply moved and inspired just as its prequel did 13 years ago. It is a true illustration of the power of human imagination. I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a visually thought-provoking and emotionally powerful film experience."
"I saw the movie on theatre 4k, never felt so satisfied about paying 40euros on something in my life. M&m, popcorn and juice included. I had high expectations and Avatar 2 delivered so highly. People rating this under 10 are trolling. Never in my life seen such visuals, it was an amazing experience. I know the story lacks plot, but i really dont care. I enjoyed every minute of this and never got bored. Stop being an hater and enjoy this masterpiece. I never felt so satisfied when all the sky peolle died and Avatars wins. Some parts are cringe and they could have done better but its a comercial movie. All in all its a masterpiece and i enjoyed it as it was. Amazing. The whales were wow... really. Loved them."
"There's much less parallel universe than the first. The show starts with updating is on the growing family of the main Avatar characters in the first Avatar movie. Then it goes right to fighting. We don't really even know why they're fighting, I mean the last movie was in 2009 so does anyone remember? They're fighting just to fight and there's not real story provided as to why.I'm not impressed with the storyline that took all these years to make. Very lazy.Many younger viewers maybe didn't even see the first one so aren't even basing their reviews on the better version.It's subtitle is about water so it's no surprise there's a water society of avatars. That was a cooler part of the show.I don't know why it needed to be 3+ hours.It is not better than the first if you've seen both."
"This is my first time watching a movie in 3d. I expected to be impressed since i have watched the first movie multiple times. But damn. My expectations were exceeded like i never imagined. Its visually spectacular . Most of the scenes are supposed to make you blown away by visuals. So most long beautiful scenes were not related to the plot. Plot by the way, way too simple . Only good thing is introduction of the water clan. They were unique . Other than that nothing special about story. So as a whole im giving 10 just because i was satisfying completely by the scenery , visuals, music and action sequences . I wasnt expecting a heavy plot anyway ."
"I cannot stress this enough. Do not watch this movie if you really care about plot, storylines and writing. Do not watch this movie if you care about family dynamics, character relationships and emotional developments.This movie has no emotion apart from one woman, Neytiri. The writing was not taken into consideration and it seems as if James Cam+Team thought we could only be drawn in by the quality.I promise you after the first thirty minutes you forget how realistic this is. You forget that the eyes and the shadow effects look so ""real"".. it doesn't matter truly.The way CGI has evolved this stuff cannot really impress average movie watchers or MCU fans (extra credit) James you made this movie in 2009.. we are in 2022 entering 2023, I can assure you we are well adjusted to good graphics and realistic CGI.But its not even just about the graphics it is THE WRITING.""Cuz"" ""I see you"" ""Bro"" ""Butthole"" the four words these writers will never shut up about. ""I see you"" is said so much that it looses its emotional meaning, it started with the parents as a symbol of love, then became a tribal thing as a symbol of respect and then just a casual lingo for teenagers.The comedic touch is barely there. My cinema did not crack a laugh once.. I mean I genuinely understand why this was 12 rated. They had Lo'ak stick the middle finger and proceed to call someone a butthole. How hilarious? I do understand teenagers and how they are but James.. atleast make it up to date.It's not even just the phrases though it goes way more deeper than that. I really tried my hardest to seek emotion through the words that came out of the avatars.Lo'ak told his brother he sees a whale more of a brother than him. Rude right? But the brother didn't care or at least he acted like he didn't. But we will never know because James did not give us the opportunity to see what value these hurtful words hold.We didn't get to see the struggle the brothers had trying to live up to the father's expectations and the effect that had on them other than Lo'ak talking to a whale.I think the most disgusting thing of all is Neteyam dying and Jake being oblivious. No tear, no rage, no hurt, no pain just ""We have to fight"" in response to his woman screaming crying (rare occasion of emotion)
How does that even make sense? Jake had to have felt something but again these writers do not let us FEEL.One star is only for the quality and that is about it."
"Most agree, including me, that the film is a technological marvel. There is simply no doubt, James Cameron is an innovator of the highest order. This film has the quality and realistic underwater scenes that a movie such as Aquaman (a hit in its own right), could only dream about.With so many on this forum complaining of a lack of storyline however I was fearing the worst heading into the cinema, only to be surprised. I'm pleased to say the armchair critics are way off the mark. And note please, the vast majority offer absolutely no evidence for their hand - ringing whines. For the record, the story is quite different from the first episode. Besides introducing the ocean going Metkayina clan to us, the narrative spends a great portion of onscreen time, exploring the support characters, such as the Sully offspring, Spider and the kids of Metkayina chief Tonowari and his wife Ronal. One has to gather therefore, that many of these characters will have parts to play in future episodes. For countless correspondents to slavishly continue to state ""the story is the same as the first"" is patently false and simply not supported by an objective viewing of the movie.This is not to say the movie and its story is perfect. I still found the ""resurrection technology"" sketched out relatively thinly and quite difficult to follow. And um ... what did happen to the Metkayina tribe in the final battle? One minute they seemed to be there onscreen and the next they were gone, apparently content to leave the heavy lifting to the Sully family and Payakan, the Tulkun. It didn't really feel right and then the clan turns out in numbers for the funeral scene. It was an unusually odd continuity lapse in what really is an outstanding and thoroughly entertaining 3 hour+ movie.Go see it in numbers. You won't be disappointed. I'm happy to admit I do want to see it a commercial success, because I'm rather keen to see how this story continues in Part 3."
"Here's The 4K Lowedown on ""Avatar: the Way of Water"" (PG-13 - 2022 - Theater)
Genre: Sci-Fi/InvasionMy Score: 8.4
Cast=10 Acting=8 Plot=6 Ending=9 Story=8
CGI=10 Pace=6 Tech=10 Alien=10 Invasion=7Once a familiar threat returns to finish what was previously started, Jake must work with Neytiri and the army of the Na'vi race to protect their home.""The way of water connects all things...before your birth and after your death."" One regret i had with the first was not seeing it in 3D in the theater...it was a great experience I was able to have with this movie. There's no denying James Cameron's vision, but this long-winded film did not have to be over 3 hours long. The story was another PSA to how horrible we were in the past...I mean I get it we sucked. I could talk about that till I was blue in the face (lol), but in a nutshell this movie is worth experiencing in the theater for the visuals alone."
"This movie can do more for peace and ecologie than any dialogue to putin. Just trasmissione it in all Russia and Ukrain for free. I'm sure citizens will understand mire than another one.

"Do not waste your money on this 3 hour pile of hot mess. The story is pointless, the dialogue embarrassing, the characters are so hard to like. The plot had so many holes, at times it felt like the Director was taking the piss.Why was it so important to send a group of avatars of the original mercenaries, to take down one other avatar who had quietly retired from guerrilla warfare to raise his family of winey teenagers? The inevitable ending with the main protagonists battling it out in hand to hand combat was obvious after the first 5 minutes. Why did we have to suffer for 3 hours to get there?Cameos by Bendan Cowell and Jemaine Clements are fun for Aussie and Kiwi audiences.In summary, this is one of the most pointless movies you will ever see, and the cool CGI is completely wasted on such a diabolical story. Cant wait for Avatar 3..."
"An immediately forgettable seafaring yarn. I couldn't wait for it to be over. Spectacular visuals and 3D especially if seen in IMAX, but that cannot sustain a weak story for 3+ hours. It was basically just a re-hash of the first movie but in a different setting. Instead of ""Save the rainforest"" it's now ""Save the whales.""In the first movie they were after a rare superconducting element called unobtainium. In this movie they are after some liquid in the head of the whale creatures which has significant medicinal properties This is not a new concept. Whale oil from the head of sperm whales was considered extremely valuable back in the whaling days."
"With 2,420 reviews already I thought ""why waste my time"". But really, I am so tired of potentially great films being botched.First, I don't want to spoil this for those who LIKED this movie, so if you thought it was great, continue to love it and feel free to stop reading now, 'cos I'm about to be somewhat negative about a few aspects.Despite the drawbacks of the first movie (Pocahontas script la la la)... it was visually beautiful. The Pandoran forest was truly alien and above all, the story line was still unique enough to draw one into this fantasy world completely.This second movie is like a Michael Bay Transformers movie with military assault weapons and fight scenes and explosions and action and-- WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CONCEPT OF STORY??? Good guys run away from bad guys, good guys fight the bad guys, yadda yadda yadda.This could have been so much better developed. Sure, the sea creatures are interesting and well done. The ""intelligent whales"" were a big jump the shark for me personally, but okay, intelligent whales. We wonder still about just how intelligent whales are on Earth. I can handle that.But what really burned me was this: it was so obvious that humans would return EN FORCE... and Mr. Marine-turned-Pandoran, brilliant military man / strategist / warrior that he is, didn't really prepare ANYONE for that very obvious future incursion. WHAT WAS HE THINKING? (Or rather, what was Cameron thinking?)What, they're just going to settle into their nice, idealistic alien life and never have a problem with humans ever again? Seriously?This movie was all flash and no substance. Sure, the CGI and special effects were great. How could they NOT be in this day and age. I do admit in many parts of the movie I found myself asking, ""Did they film this in an Earth coral reef?"" because seriously, it just wasn't all that ""Pandoran"". It's like they took a standard seascape and threw in a special jellyfish here or a different plant there and it was all just kinda ho-hum. Nothing like the complex and gorgeous scenery of the first movie.Sorry, but this movie just lacked heart. Sure, Neytiri was incredible when she went on a rampage (go Neytiri!) and the bad buys were proper scum-sucking pigs (people hate whale killers even on Earth). There were parts of the movie that were somewhat interesting, but a whole lot more parts that were just ho-hum another large military battle please get it over and put some actual story into this thing.Which is where this movie falls apart. It simply doesn't have anywhere near the heart and soul of the first movie, and we've seen it all before. Remind me again, was it Cameron or Michael Bay who made this movie?"
"Watched Avatar: The Way of Water with Sam Worthington(Hacksaw Ridge) as Jake Sully aka Toruk Makto, Zoe Saldana(Avengers:Endgame) as Neytiri, Jack Champion(The Night Sitter) as Spider, Britain Dalton(Uncharted 4) as Lo'ak , Bailey Bass(Moon & Sun) as Reyna, Stephen Lang(Dont Breathe) as Colonel Miles Quaritch, Matt Gerald(Faster) as Lyle Wainfleet,Brendan Cowell(The Current War) as Mick Scoresby, Jermaine Clement(Flight Of The Conchords ) as Dr. Ian Garvin Featuring Sigourney Weaver(Aliens) as Kiri, Cliff Curtis(Doctor Sleep) as Tonowari , Oscar Winner Kate Winslet(The Reader) as Ronal and Edie Falco(The Sopranos) as General Ardmore New Big bad of the Series .My Issues are that film is overly Long hoping for a Shorter version I really think they couldve condensed into a 2 Hour 30- 45 Minute Runtime on the Hope they do Home releases and some character is thin in some areas but I really enjoyed the Story, Jake and Neytiri having an established Family and this Underwater Performance technology will only get better much like Stagecraft but im glad the Just Indigenous are getting there due on the big screen and are no longer racist Stereotypes.Great Score By Simon Fraglen(The Magnificent Seven) & Themes By The Late James Horner(The Amazing Spider-Man) , Cinematography by Russell Carpenter(Ant-Man) , and Direction By James Cameron(Titanic,Avatar) Awesome Techonological Breakthorughs as well Indigenous Representations but Couldve Condensed The Runtime of this Long Awaited Sequel 8/10."
This movie was beautiful and had a good story. I first read all reviews and felt disappointed to go watch but glad I went to watch. 1 I didn't even see them use bro to much it was maybe like 9 times they said it. 2 there was a good story a story about how family should stick together in order to survive. And they showed the consequences of what happened if they did not stick together. The movie showed conflict through the children of Jake's and also the conflict of the other people. People who gave this movie a bad review obviously have way beyond too high expectations. And I even have high expectations but this movie blew all of mine away. And the action in this movie was just awesome. And oh yeah watch it in 3d.
"So so disappointing. The film is all style and no substance. Yes, the visuals are amazing but all of that doesn't matter when you don't care about the characters. Character development is none existent and it's impossible for the first 2 hours to know who is who. The story and script are lazy and there's some real clangers of one liners.The film is way too long and the 3D format is dead. At one point near the end, it almost felt like I was watching Titanic. Sigourney Weaver's character is silly and I didn't even know Kate Winslet was in it until the final credits.Overall, the visuals are great but we've seen it all before.Snoozefest. Avoid."
"Well the bar in the first movie is so high, and sometimes this is the problem with the sequel to match the expectation. The movie has the stunning visuals with the imaganarity world, but other than that stopy seems to be copied from bits and pieces from the first part itself, the only difference that it was on soil and this was under water. The story is quite slow and considering that it is 3 hours long, it acts as a double edged sword. I am sure that coming from the backdrop of the already established imaginary world with the remarkable visuals and having an advantage of 10 years advanced technology, the only thing was required here was a gripping story."
"It's never easy to talk about ""Avatar"" because for the average audience it seems to be a masterpiece of cinema... Indeed, the Avatar saga in general is a masterpiece but not of cinema, it's a masterpiece for the effects but if we have to talk about cinema let's say that there is better on the market. Avatar 2 is spectacular for the eyes but does not leave the magic that the first chapter had left, with this I am not saying that it is not a beautiful film, on the contrary, in my opinion it simply does not deserve all this success. It's a normal science fiction film with an above average budget that tries to surpass the first chapter but fails in its intent, at this point I wonder if it's worth seeing another 2 chapters of this saga that focuses only on the visual aspect and little about a functional plot construction. Without making too many spoilers this film leaves too many question marks, this is a marketing move that works but you have to ask yourself :""how much longer are we willing to wait to get all the answers?"". Finally I want to say that as a film it is very, very beautiful, I admit that in one particular scene I cried, but surely the collection it is making is excessive in my opinion."
Even though people say Vfx are good but no one want to watch more than 1hour of national geographic blue water documentary in theatres and this is what you are getting in the movie. About story is below average. The fame of avatar will go down as you start watching movie in theatres. You look at your watch every fifteen minutes when will the movie will end. So basically the Vfx are good but story s**ks. And watching on digital platforms will good as you have option to skip many parts. I will just give six star as for me spending so much money and time is not worth it. So think before you watch.
"This is what took 13 years to make? Seriously? Who directed this like a videogame and overly sped-up action scenes-horny teenager and where have they buried the real James Cameron? I will definitely not go back to the theater for any more Avatar movies after this fiasco, I will wait for them to stream or not watch them at all. I didn't even feel the 3D as much this time either, it was a fairly flat movie with a few moments of 3D when projectiles were flying at me or particles floating in front of the image. No more proper pacing, no more slowing down some scenes to create actual awe and wonder, everything is fast-paced like it's made by a complete maniac. What a let-down, wow. It's not even a ""visual spectacle"" this time because all the plants and animals look like plastic figurines in a videogame's cutscenes (which is only made even more obvious and jarring if you see it in HFR), so it failed even at its most basic task. And as many have said, the writing is also bottom of the barrel stuff, again like the ""script"" for your average videogame between-missions cinematics. Considering this and the Dark Fate fiasco I'm starting to believe James Cameron is actually dead and has been replaced by a lookalike just to keep the marketing going."
"Once again, the strongest element of the second outing is the visual effects. I don't believe I've ever seen CGI look this good, so good in fact that it puts many other modern movie blockbusters to shame. The action scenes do not disappoint and are surprisingly pretty brutal. As far as the story, I found it to be a little refreshing to see more personality in the characters and it was nice to have that family dynamic between Jake, Neytiri, and their children. Colonel Quaritch also has a bit more dimension to his character and will likely continue to be explored in future films. My biggest gripe is that the story feels a bit too thin for a movie this long. Some noticeable plot holes can be a bit jarring. Some problems also carry over from the first film to this, like the heavy handed environmental messages and the lack of nuance which prevents potential interesting ideas from being explored that could add depth to the story. As the credits rolled, I found this film to be an improvement, not a massive one, but an improvement. Final verdict: 7/10."
"If you do you're falling for the banana in the tailpipe, and the funny Hollywood math. First of all this movie is not good enough to make that much money. Secondly it's just mathematically impossible. You have to spend $100 million on your own ticket, or corporate spent a billion and 4/5 come and let you spend the rest. Hollywood thinks you listen to anything they say. They think you're stupid. Since their mainstream media whatever they say goes in your mind that's what they think. Are you really going to go for that? It took Star wars A New Hope, 3 years at three dollars a ticket back in the day, to be the biggest legitimate box office success in the world. You haven't invented a math that explains what they're doing these days. It's just not possible. I'm going with the flow. It looks like I gave it 10 Stars. In reality I give it zero Stars."
"No doubt the visual aspect of the movie is amazing! Beautifully done.However, the story is just an insult. 5-10 minutes introduction where you can see that now he has a family with kids. Then the villain of the first movie seeks revenge and another war starts. There is no difference from this to some stupid low budget fight movie. If the surroundings were not that beautiful and the species was not blue, it would just be another dumb revenge movie. I cannot understand why this movie is highly rated, especially by older folks. As a kid, I would have certainly liked it as well. I was so bored that we left after the first half. I was devastated as I really like the first part of Avatar a lot. Was one of my favorite movies."
"Visually stunning, with great sequences that, thanks to the 3D, feel life-like. However, that's basically the end of it.There seems to be a bit of plot going on in the first third of the film (theme of revenge, family struggles, adaptation to a new world/body) but after that there is barely anything going on, apart from visual scenes that drag on for way too long (5-10 minutes over what is needed), and the whole movie basically drags on forever and ever (including an ending that is ""neverending"" ). Plus, there are several plot elements that are basically forgotten and therefore quite useless.If it had been at least 45 minutes shorter, or better yet, 1 hour, it probably would have been a decent sequel. Sadly, it wasn't the case."
"Overall it's an okay film, for sheer spectacle and grandeur it is immensely impressive, cinematography and effects are very good and show it to its true light seen in imax in 3d( I normally do not like films in 3D but made an exception for this and it works fairly well in 3D, but not as much as the original.More should have been made of some of the new characters, esp Grace's daughter definitely more to come there
However despite the spectacle, the story line was fairly weak, and I couldn't help feeling it was just more of the same
The original Avatar back in 2008 was genuinely original
And I loved it, this really seemed like more of the same and it was too long by around 30mins( found myself looking at my watch a few times, they never happened with the first one)
Not sure I'll bother with no3
Go see the original instead frankly it's much better."
"Come from the latest film by James Cameron and what he delivers is really made for the big screen the 3d is on a completely different level, the images too, from the colors. For me, it's a masterpiece and films like this should be seen in the cinema, that's what cinemas are made for. If you have the chance to look at it in Imax, be sure to see it, because it unfolds its full potential. The 3d and cgi is not oppressive like some of the other films here it is very pleasant. What you notice, you really shot under water, you can totally see that in the film. The film is multifaceted and deals with many topics, such as family or how you feel, being an outsider and much more. The film builds up slowly and doesn't change too quickly, you take your time for the individual characters. Thanks to James Cameron for this great film and the 190 minutes fly by, rather not as long as you would imagine. I forgive, a 10/10 because everything fits, I'll watch it again on Wednesday in Imax in 3d. Watch him in the cinema, on the biggest screen your cinema has to offer."
"How this endeavor has garnered positive attention just smacks as to the engine of the masses being asses. This thing bloats its way via very predictable narrative to inevitable non-conclusion. And for what?The paper thin story dressed up in all its CGI remains that same paper thin rambler. No amount of window dressing can foster interest in any of these unremarkable characters. You. Will. Yawn. A lot.Cameron's heydays have come and sadly gone, so why the emperor's new clothes treatment here? No idea. And there's more sequels in the pipeline? Why!? Save your precious time, and avoid this sequel.Production value is aces. Everything else? Hard pass, hence the deuce."
All I have to say is that this is one of the few movies from this year that I actually felt strong emotions. I was all over the place seeing Pandora again and seeing Jake and Neytiri with their new family.This movie uses that family well to convey deep emotions inside you. You get to learn more about them as characters and get interested in their roles for the later movies. You feel their deep bond. And I feel like that has been lacking in movies a lot for blockbusters. It's a nice fresh of breath air to follow this family and get into their struggles.Please see this movie so that they'll make more. I want more movies that make me actually feel things again.
"The first thing on my mind when I saw this movie was how terrible was spider (played by Jack Champion). The acting was worse than 8th grade children play. It was really annoying. I Dont understand how and actor like this could end up in such a big budget movie.The visuals of the movie are ofcourse stunning - the vfx is on another level. But the script is really shallow. It has been in the making for 13 years - and the most important part seems to be have forgotten. It is an average movie at best.They Dont take time to develop the back story, tell us about the land or its habitants. The first movie actually was a lot better.."
"Fantasy action adventure, with amazing 3D visual effects.This was practically a repeat of the first movie, this time the theme was water, underwater, seascapes, etc, rather than trees, forest, and a jungle setting.Remember the original military antagonist, well, they manage to manufacture a contrived comeback. You can predict mostly everything that will happen, a couple of plot twists would have improved.192 minutes was way too long, the average 12-year-old might struggle to engage throughout, as would many adults, editing 60 minutes from the middle would improve.Not bad, not great, this is mostly an amazing visual spectacle but with a lame plot."
"Expectations were high. The film is visually beautiful. There are a few places where the CGI looks unrealistic or strange. Overall, the film is definitely stretched too far. I wanted to rewind the film more than once. It was hard to sit still. I think a 2 hour running time would be perfect. There are a lot of unnecessary and redundant places. The plot is boring, predictable and has been seen before. There are a lot of similar events where it just seems to be copied from the first part and something slightly changed. I will definitely not try to watch it a second time, and if there is a third part I will definitely not watch it in the cinema."
"Story is good enough to keep you bounded along though not close to intense to call it great or a masterpiece in the sense that movie does not lingering in the mind as part 1. Also, 14 years later vfx does not create similar impact as it did in 2009.Transitions smoothly from 1st part - nicely dropping 'unobtanium' word from part one which sounded light.Moving from jungle to ocean is nicely done and with very human touch can be felt & seen.Great cinematography and scenery - a feast for eyes.Great sound mixing.Continued from first part on 'integrated life'' in jungle to 'integrated life' in ocean and added on top of it - integrating people from different tribe; strong message with very subtle in approach."
"After seeing all the hype and trailers for this movie well in advance there was no way I wasn't going to see this at the cinema. I liked the first one as it was original and the creativity and imagination was amazing. The creativity and imagination for this one in relation to the cinematography was again, amazing, but.... I am quite glad I didn't pay extra to watch this on imax or anything.Much like some of the other reviews say, the picture itself was so clever and pretty in places, but for a film that lasts over 3 hours I expect some development of a story that immerses me in the emotion and tension of something as well as just the picture.I found that I predicted pretty much what was going to happen in the first 30 minutes, and I hate to say it, I was right and got a bit bored in the end.If I heard the words ""a father protects his family"" one more time I might've actually walked out!!It is a real shame that the story didn't have anything more than a basic and superficial storyline, in my opinion, and didn't really develop the avatar world from the first movie."
"Avatar: way of the water is the best film since interstellar personally.I had gone and watched it with my partner and a few friends and was blown away.It had brilliant use of the new technologies that james cameron has been waiting for and/or developing. The story was clear, understandable and beautiful. My only criticisms is that some certain characters could of had more development and it feels like JC bit off more than he could chew with notable cuts to keep the allready long movie short. However, despite this he has created a beutiful and emotional piece of art. I truly believe that he is invested in this film series and can't wait for the next.We are allready booking to watch it again and i hope to bring my grandfather as he loved the original film."
"If the essence of cinema is to create a cinematic universe in which reality can be transformed, projected, enlarged or distorted, 'Avatar: The Way of Water' is a great success. After having seen the film, each viewer will understand that the story is about so much more than mankind destroying the beautiful planet Pandora and its friendly inhabitants, de Na'vi. Lots of hotly debated issues are part of the story. The message about ecological destruction is very clear, but the film also deals with the refugee problem, racism, the obsession with youth and health, religion, and the importance of the nuclear family. There's lots to talk about afterwards.At the same time, this is a blockbuster movie, and providing entertainment has clearly been the first priority of the film makers. The messages are there for those who want to see them, but they are not in-your-face as they were in, for example 'Don't Look Up'. There are many magical moments in the movie, but other scenes made me cringe because of their simplicity or sentimentality. I also was a bit annoyed by the simple good versus bad theme that dominates the screenplay.The movie is a showcase of the limitless possibilities offered by computer generated images. Many scenes are jaw-dropping. But at the same time, it struck me as too big, too exaggerated, too far removed from a simple, human scale. Only afterwards I realized that the teenage girl Kiri was played by 69 years old Sigourney Weaver. That's because I didn't see Weaver herself, I saw a computerized and distorted version of her.So is this a great movie? Yes. Anyone watching it will be amazed, will have a great time and will have something to talk about afterwards. Did it dissapoint me? Also yes. Because it prefers to be spectacular instead of sophisticated."
"For my review I would like to expand on 3 things:1. The Visual Spectacle: Needless to say this film is probably the first one in recent memory that truly blurs the line between what is real and what is not. Enhanced by the amazing 3D, the audience is transported yet again to the lush jungles and oceans of Pandora! You forget that what you are watching was filmed on a production set and believe that what you are seeing was filmed on location!2. Family: The Way of Water has a refreshingly strong theme of family. It is almost as if the film had grown up with the people that saw the first film who by now probably have families of their own and can relate on this theme. Each of Jake's children had their own story to tell and the 3hr running time lended itself well to allow for them to develop their character.3. Environmentalism: Most are aware of Cameron's love for the oceans, and we get to see just how much in this film. From beautiful ocean flora and fauna to heart wrenching scenes inspired by what's happening right here on Earth, Cameron makes us care for this new dimension of Pandora and by extension our own Planet Earth's oceans.I believe these 3 themes are the core pillars of why this film stands above the first film and sets up a whole series of films in the coming years. People who see this in the big screens are sure to keep coming back for more!"
"Reading reviews on here really reminds me of the literary folktale written by Danish author Hans Christian Andersen, about a vain emperor who gets cheated by 2 swindlers purporting to sell him invisible, magical clothes. When the emperor walks amongst his subjects, the townsfolk uncomfortably go along with the pretense, not wanting to appear inept or stupid, until a child blurts out that the emperor is wearing nothing at all. The people then realize that everyone has been fooled. Although startled, the emperor continues the procession, walking more proudly than ever ...Anyway excellent cinematography but i would like my 3 hours back please."
"While not perfect, Avatar 2 is an incredible, confident return to Pandora - and one that literally delves much deeper into the nature and culture of this fascinating alien world. A continuation of Jake Sully's story that adds fresh new characters, a new environment, and in all ways enhances the world laid out in the first film, Avatar 2 was well worth the 13 year wait.The film is not without flaw, but these flaws can be easily accepted and moved past in the wake of everything great the film does bring to the table: a visual feast of beautiful shots, incredible special effects, unique and interesting characters, an exciting soundtrack, and an emotional depth on par with the first film.Some of the plot line may seem re-used from the original, a few moments can feel cheesy or predictable at times, and the message on nature conservation is definitely too on-the-nose at times, but the film as a whole more than makes up for those moments with everything it does bring the viewer.Watching in 3D was a visual treat, as the 3D was used to enhance the visuals and add depth to the shots, without overdoing it (nothing flying out of the screen at your head). Perfect use of 3D that never once tired my eyes, even after 3 hours of watching. THIS is exactly how 3D should be used.The 3 hrs 12 min run time flies by and there is never a dull moment. The whole film flows so fluidly that it never really feels too long.Overall, Avatar: The Way of Water is an exciting, beautiful return to the incredible spectacle that is Pandora. A perfect balance of exciting and emotional, action-packed and fun, violent but still family friendly. I only wish I could see it for the first time again."
"A breathtaking visual masterpiece. This movie lived up to the chills I felt watching the trailer, it lived up to the pedestal I had placed it on, it was honestly incredible. The plot of the movie wasn't anything new or really fresh, it was the classic protect the people, protect the family but built on characters I loved from the original Avatar movie whilst introducing new characters I grew to care for. Thankfully there wasn't this strong plot armour I'd initially expected so studios could make more revenue from both the established and newer characters as the movie does show real loss which I felt added to the depth of the story and made it all the more compelling. Hearing so many sequels in the works, I was worried we were entering a ""Marvel-like"" state where it would be built on gimmicks to lure viewers in to bolster James Cameron's box office successes but I'm pleased I was wrong at least in the first sequel. The way new characters were introduced helped me the viewer learn more about this fresh new aquatic Pandora landscape and made things much easier to grasp rather than just being thrown straight in. I felt James Cameron captured the performances of the cast extremely well with Zoe Saldanas' Neytiri being my personal favourite showing great range throughout. The movie certainly isn't perfect but when pitched against other releases this year, it is more certainly a standout and felt very fresh leaving me reeling in anticipation for any further sequels. I do want to mention the score for the movie along with the trailer as it was brilliant and was partnered well with the scenes to give off emotional cues on the severity of what was going on. I'd highly recommend giving this one a watch and would suggest you try to ignore the box office performance and records and give yourself the room to really dive in and let the the film take you to a different world."
"After 13 long years of anticipation, we finally are able to take a return trip to Pandora and the magical world that James Cameron created. While 13 years is a long time to wait for a sequel nowadays, it's amazing how the breathtaking experience of seeing 'Avatar: The Way of Water' triggers the same sensory overload experienced when watching its predecessor for the first time.Sure, it's not as groundbreaking as the original, but 'Water' is well worth a watch thanks to the way it advances the story, introducing us to new characters, reuniting us with old friends and foes, and exploring many more wonders that the planet has to offer. Of course, the star of the show is the CGI, which is unparalleled. Even though there are a few scenes that look like they could have used a bit more work, it's hard to complain about the eye candy that the entire film is.While this alone makes 'Water' seeing, there are still some weak spots, including the dialogue. Some lines feel extremely forced and cliched enough to make George Lucas blush, but again, a masterful script is not expected here. There's also a feeling of less attachment to the main characters, even though the inverse should be what you'd naturally expect. Still, the story is well set up to continue into the coming sequels.In short, 'Avatar: The Way of Water' is one of the few follow-up entries in a franchise that has the power to grow its audience due to its ultra high quality production value."
"I waited 13 years for this sequel and it finally came. The visuals are stunning, the acting is great and i loved that they showed more of pandora and its inhabitants. The story was very light tho and i found some things which didn't make much sense to me but otherwise it's awesome. I particularly loved the new characters such as Kiri (which i believe it's Pandora's messiah or sort of), even thought the voice of a 70 year old woman is a bit off for a teenager. The production is even more brilliant than the first movie, they did not only create a whole new language with grammar rules but even a sign language, which is a great form of inclusivity. I need an ikran now."
"Avatar: The Way of Water (2022) follows Jake Sully and his newfound family as they fight to keep their family together and protect the moon of Pandora. I was incredibly excited for the release of this movie and it did not disappoint! I love this film even more than the original and cannot wait for the next films in the franchise.This movie is definitely one of the most visually gorgeous films I've ever seen, if not THE most gorgeous. The CGI is once again absolutely flawless and really helps to improve upon the world building of the first movie. Every shot took my breathe away and it's such a brilliant film to experience in a cinema for this reason. There are such a broad range of eye-catching colour palettes that feel pretty hypnotic at times.The sound design is well-crafted, and it makes great use of the surround sound. The score itself is mystical and really helps to immerse the audience into the world of Pandora whilst also including the parts of the score from the original that are instantly recognisable to the Avatar franchise.One other thing that impressed me about this film is the characters, and how well written they are. I cared for all of them deeply, and I feel this movie really helped to flesh them out further. The actors give such strong performances, especially Zoe Saldaña as Neytiri. Every emotional she portrays hits so hard and her performance is completely captivating. Also, the dialogue is very well written, with a lot of heart and meaning.Lastly, the movie is paced very well and kept me interested every second. I was a bit skeptical, with this film being over three hours, but after viewing I believe it makes use of its time perfectly and has enough going on for the film to be consistently engaging. It has a nice blend of slow and fast sequences that piece the film together well and make it a very enjoyable watch."
"James Cameron is a master at creating follow-up films that capitalize on the excitement, tension, and innovative technology of the original films. He is a superb storyteller as well, mixing in Titanic and The Abyss the majestic immensity of the oceans and the cold depths of the deep.Avatar: The Way of Water, which features echoes of all those earlier movies, is a very entertaining sequel to the 2009 sci-fi eco-thriller that is still the highest-grossing film of all time, so it should come as no surprise to anyone.This $350 million sequel's narrative sophistication and, more importantly, its dialogue are virtually as simplistic as its predecessor and, at moments, downright weak. Nonetheless, the extended, biodiverse world-building captivates you, the visual extravaganza has your attention, the environmental consciousness is stirring, and the combat is as visceral and thrilling as any multiplex audience could hope for.The Way of Water is most amazing because it offers a strong argument for CGI at a time when most VFX-heavy films go for repetitive efficiency, which has robbed movies of much of their beauty. Cameron flourishes in the artifice of the digital toolbox, in contrast to other filmmakers like Robert Zemeckis and Ang Lee who have occasionally allowed technology experimentation to stifle their creative inclinations.DP The aesthetically striking Avatar 2 uses High Dynamic Range at 48 frames per second to offer an immersive 3-D experience. Skeptics might not be altogether off-base because the surreal giant-screen experience is gorgeous to look at.Depending on how interested you are in a sci-fi survival story that borrows elements from classic Westerns while raising the stakes with the possibility of genocide, you'll decide how much you care about the destiny of a group of oversized blue people. In any case, this is a substantial film-even monumental-that merits its lengthy running duration of more than three hours as well as its enormous budget.In Pandora, Jake Sully and his warrior wife Neytiri have raised their family, which consists of their adopted daughter Kiri, Neteyam, Lo'ak, and Tuk, a preteen sister.Spider, a human infant left orphaned by the ""Sky People"" battle and too young to be put into cryosleep at the conclusion of the first film when the colonists and their military security force were sent back to Earth, spends more time with the Na'vi than he does in the lab with the science nerds. Although having a strong bond with the Pandorans, his conflicted loyalties make him a living example of the conflict that will inevitably arise in later chapters. It doesn't take long for his father's identity to become clear.The Omaticaya clan, led by Jake, lives in peace, but when the invaders return to Pandora with plans to mine the moon for ""unobtainium"" and build a human colony, their way of life is threatened.After giving orders, General Francis Ardmore vanishes from view in an Amplified Mobility Platform, an offshoot of Ripley's exoskeleton loader.A security team led by a larger, faster Na'vi avatar and a group of redesigned big-foot blue troops is under the command of Colonel Miles Quaritch. A Marine cannot be killed, but Quaritch cautions that they will reassemble in Hell.With his new form, Quaritch has little regard for the Na'vi people, and his contempt for ""half-breeds"" makes him even more like a villain from the Wild West than before.Jake gives up his position as chief of the Omaticaya tribe and moves to a remote group of islands inhabited by the Metkayina clan, who provide refuge despite the danger to their society.Aonung and Lo'ak disagree, but Tsireya is a kind instructor, and Kiri adapts to her new surroundings easily. Kiri inherited Grace's love of the natural world and her deep ties to Eywa, the Na'vi god.The sequences of domestic family life and adolescent interaction are genuinely captivating, even though the Na'vi adults speak in a strange accent and their children seem like they've wandered off the set of a CW teen drama.With the Metkayina people, who are physiologically different from the Omatikayas and have adapted to ocean life, Cameron pays homage to the Indigenous people of New Zealand.Technology, creativity, and craftsmanship are skillfully combined in Simon Franglen's score for Cameron's 2009 film, but what truly sets it apart is Cameron's sincere faith in humanity."
"If you thought the first Avatar was visually beautiful, the sequel to Avatar (2009) definitely takes the visuals up a notch! Every location was stunning with vibrant colours and diverse settings.The returning cast did great in their roles, as well as Sigourney Weaver returning in a new role, as one of the Na'vi teenagers who seemed to have a strong connection to Pandora's spirit, Ewa. The new cast also seemed interesting and did well in their roles.The ending was pieced together quite well with a major plot twist linking to the eventual third Avatar.My complaints of the second Avatar had to do mainly with the plot, pacing and dialogue.The plot was a little weak at some points, such as how the story was focussed on irrelevant features and the way the story telling of Kiri was conducted. The pacing was poor, the middle part of the movie dragged; such as when Jake's family reach the island camp and train for such a long while. One of Jake's kids had a brewing friendship with a whale which was nice, however these scenes could have been shortened.The dialogue was laughable at best in some scenes. The teens in the movie said ""Bro"", ""Sick"" and ""Cuz"" a lot. If this is Cameron's team attempting to appeal to younger audiences, I don't see much of a problem with it, but it felt a bit unnatural on how it was written in and maybe should have consulted younger people on how it should be written in the script. Yet better, it would of been cool if Cameron's team came up with their own Na'vi language slang.Otherwise, it is a sequel that is worth watching, even if it is the only one time."
"Graphic: It's okay. But we are not here just for 3 hours of National Geography, aren't we?Story: Non-existent.Dialogues: Too much ""bro"", bro. Cliché dialogues such as ""I trust you"", ""You must be strong"", things like that, but because there are no cohesive story behind them, after a while, they just becomes background noises for you to focus on watching alien creatures do the bare minimum for human's cinematic entertainment.Character: The only thing that I think has potential to centralize the story around is the fact that the daughter has ability of listening to larger than life whispers or something (because other than that, nothing is different from the Avatar universe background from 1st version), but it was not leveraged well in the storyline or character development. It was just there - like you are a 160 IQ genius, but all you do is calculating money changes in 0.000075s for customers at McDonald's instead of curing cancer.To summarize: It's like that Tiktok meme: ""Hope you are hungry... (from the success of the 1st Avatar) for nothing"" - And, I am so bored. And this movie might be perfect to sum up 2022 - a year full of disappointment and economic instability."
"The movie ""Avatar: The way of Water"" is simply beautiful to watch. James Cameron created an amazing spectacle of beauty and magic. Technically the movie is perfect, both visually and soundly.Cameron's great cleverness at this time was to transport the plot from the world of forests and mountains to the sea, and he is an expert in filming at the water of the ocean. I admit that my interest in the movie was not the plot but rather the technical magic that Cameron delivers in his movies and boy, I was not disappointed.Please do a favor to yourself and watch this movie on a big screen, 3D and all the apparatus in the movie theater."
"So much unnecessary shooting and explosions. I was bored the whole second half of the movie. That time could haave been better spent on building up the characters. The plot is without twists. Everything was predictable from the point when the family arrived at the island. The parallel with the first movie when Jake learns about the forrest ways, is very clear, but the annoying thing is that the newly born military clones never had to learn anything. Ever time I hoped the shooting was done, it was just a coffee break. Talking about breaks, I'm wondering where did all the water aliens disappear from the battle. Effectively only Jake's family + 1 were involved. The first part of the movie does deserve an 8, but the rest is just zero."
"After more than a decade of waiting, i finally got to see Avatar: the way of water. Watching it at IMAX in 3D was an experience like no other and the movie is absolutely breathtaking and I was blown away by how amazing it was. It's an experience i recommendHowever, like many people have pointed out, the story is a bit boring and too similar to the first movie. Dont get me wrong, the characters, the lore and the world built by James Cameron is absolutely amazing, and I cannot wait to see more. But the actual progression of the story is so extremely similar to the first one, it was very dissapointing. Especially after all the hype Cameron did before the release of the movie. It also ends in a way that makes it seem like this exact plot will be repeated in the next movie, which is just so disappointing when it has takes years and years to perfect.The movie is beautiful, the characters are great, the world they have created is a masterpiece. The plot, is boring and predictable."
"Hands down, the best visuals I have ever seen. I was in tears through the whole movie. The visuals of Avatar: The Way of Water define it, and it delivers on the magical yet awe filled atmosphere that reverberates within the first movie.Yes, this movie is essentially the framework of the first Avatar, with different characters in the same scenarios, and the plot doesn't create any significant change to Pandora, but the sequences are shot and compiled with a power that brings tears to your eyes. This film defines the very essence of the Avatar franchise: Family, love, hate, exploitation... humanity.Avatar: The Way of Water is touching on every level and sets an example for the ability of modern filmmaking in the digital space. It defines the essence of what it means to be human, just as the first movie did.This is, hands down, the most BEAUTIFUL movie I have ever seen, and I will be watching it again."
"The sequel to AVATAR, the first movie of which took the world by storm and we waited thirteen years for the second movie, is finally in theaters and I had the chance to watch IMAX by sitting in a very nice position on the night of the first day. Just like the first one, this movie was either loved or found unnecessary and was not liked at all. Needless to say, some audiences have always seen AVATAR as an uncomplicated, fantasy superhero movie. (Don't get me wrong, I love superhero movies, but usually they're all based on a certain math.) For these people, AVATAR was just about visual effects and action. On the other hand, after reading terrible comments from some of the audience who loved AVATAR, including that this movie spoiled the effect of the first one, the characters were badly written, and all expectations were in vain, I entered the theater and started to watch the movie with a lot of stress.The first impression; Director, not CGIAVATAR: The Way Of Water started with excellent visuals just as everyone expected and as a really big AVATAR fan I had goosebumps staring at the screen. However, the beauty that took my breath away wasn't the CGI (computer-generated images and visual effects) that everyone was talking about. Of course, you won't notice much at first, but especially in the second half of the movie, James Cameron show off with his directing skills. As a man who created the best action and fantasy films since years, I think Cameron showed his best performance in this movie. The point where CGI developed the most for me was the point where it combined with the Motion Capture technology used on the players. With the motion capture used in the first movie, the Navi's, which look a little more like computer game characters, combine with advanced CGI this time and look real as if such a race existed. So much so that this technology has made the facial expressions and identities of the players and thus their performances stand out. This change will make Avatar: The Way Of Water a strong nominee not only for the visual effects awards, but also for the acting awards.MusicThe soundtrack is the crown of a production for me. Soundtracks makes most cinema effective, including movies that seem very simple and do not tell a very moving story. However, music was not among my high expectations in this movie, which I went to watch with the excitement that had accumulated in me for years. The reason for this, of course, was that we lost James Horner, one of the few composers in the world and the creator of the unforgettable music of the first film, in 2015. But I must say that Simon Franglen did a good job in this movie. Even though we often come across a new version of old soundtrack, he brought the emotional intensity of those scenes to the top for me by putting new compositions that he personally composed at the most crucial points of the film. The new The Weeknd song ""Nothing is lost(you give me strength)"" played at the end of the movie was a really good song to end the movie.ScenerioOne of my favorite directors, Cameron is definitely not a strong name in the screenplay. Most of the time, he uses a typical but audience-impacting math that is not too complicated, including the first movie of AVATAR. Cameron came to the fore not with the story he wrote in AVATAR, but with his innovative technology, the world and visual show he designed, So naturally I also expected that from this movie. But when it comes to cinema, I love unexpected surprises, especially a one like this! It was a well-written script, reminiscent of the tempo and integrity of Lord Of The Rings, written in an unhurried formula that made you say ""I would have watched it for another hour"" over the three hours and twenty minutes. It was far from the American clichés you see in many of Cameron's works, it was less predictability, and it was well balanced. The character scripts were pretty good, contrary to what I've seen in many of the reviews, that by the end of the first half of the movie I was already hooked up to all the Sully family members. These intense feelings that the audience feels for the characters become a director's most powerful weapon and so he has you in the palm of his hand. AVATAR: The Way Of Water is a very good example for this. I can't say that Avatar has a structure that makes it feel like it will be a sequel, but this time, Cameron skillfully showed that the movie we watched is part of a great story and an epic production which will go on. When the movie was over, there were many stories left that I was curious about and wanted to watch the rest of. It would certainly not be wrong to say that the script was written much better than the first movie.FeelingAVATAR: The way Of Water, as Cameron say; ""This movie is very personal to me."" It is a film written entirely on the concept of family, in a way that we can summarize with the word. If this concept is valuable to you, I can hardly believe you to be unaffected by this film. The fact that parents would do anything for their children, the fact that an older brother would always take on the responsibility of being the second father in the family, and the efforts of young people who felt inadequate or different to prove themselves were impressively scripted. In the movie, the characters' reactions to situations and their movements were incredibly realistic. That's the strongest feature that separates AVATAR from any superhero movie. No character has artificial perfection. Even the movie's big names made unexpectedly emotional and naive decisions, immersing us in a story that felt very real.Social justice warThe films that deal with the topics that are widely spoken in the society and that takes the trend topic material as their sorce material have become the films that today's art lovers despise as ""box office films"". In fact, it is seen as an effort to achieve a high box office of a poor quality film. Maybe true for some movies, but such a generalization can never be made without really evaluating. James Cameron is a name who likes to include in his films today's problems that many people ignore, such as women's rights, equality, protecting our dying nature. And I think cinema is the right branch of art to present these subjects to the audience by blending them with good stories. Not every art film is one that you leave the cinema without understanding anything. Cinema is a very wide art branch. Just like Cameron did in the first movie, he made public outcries in an artist's manner once again.AVATAR: the way of water is a movie that shows that cinema has no boundaries and that if you are as brave as Cameron, you can become a giant. By taking a very wide narrative and scaling it to an intimate family level, it would certainly have drawn criticism from many viewers anyway. But except the first 45 minutes of a cute family portrait, and the last hour that was wild enough to be considered as PG-13, the middl part had a truly unique narrative, with almost no plot, just dwelling in the world, characters, societal deviations, and certain norms.Unless you're really trying not to like this movie, it will be an enjoyable 3 hours and 20 minutes. Enjoy watching."
"I was worried going in somewhat and through the first half hour, but then those all just melted away and I got lost in the wonderful world of Avatar as cliche and cheesy as it sounds, that is what happened.Too many movies and series today suffer from weak writing, imo this isn't one of them. Yes the story is nothing original and not the strongest but its compelling and tugs at your heartstrings so above average.Visuals are indeed great in many scenes but I found the 3D weak and not worth it at all, like pretty much every movie sadly. I don't remember too much of the first one but it doesn't matter too much this flick mostly stands on its own less a few tie-ins.Overall I say well done JC."
"I really liked the first movie. But this one, number two seemed very long to me, this film lasts approximately three hours and it seemed endless to me. I have to say that I kept watching it because my wife wanted to finish watching it. In my view it was the same original story but in the water, the protagonists have to relearn how to use their means of transportation but instead of the air in the water, the part of the monster that saves one of the children reminded me the story of Pinocchio where the monster swallows Gepetto. In the end the bad guy is saved after being strangled and drowned, he revives out of nowhere and they save him for the saga to continue, it looks like looney tunes comics. That's all folks."
"I don't get why anyone would make such a visually stunning movie with a storyline a ten year old can put together. What was James Cameron thinking? The plot was so weak, by the end of the excruciatingly long three hour movie of the same thing again and again - I just didn't care what happened to the characters. The main characters were weak and there were confusing plot holes. It could have been 1.5 hour movie max. If I wanted to watch something that was based underwater, I would watch David Attenborough's Blue planet or even Finding Nemo. At least, they have decent storylines ! What's going to be in Avatar 3 & 4? More of this pathetic drivel? No thank you."
"While the overarching plot may leave you wondering if the writers thought things through, there is enough subplot, action scenes, and pretty scenery to make a rough framework into a meaningful and emotional journey. The spiritual essence of the first Avatar film remains, and the character relationships in the film feel genuine, although there is quite a bit of loose ends left to definitely entice for an Avatar 3.The subplot consists of a teenage Na'avi coming of age story, as Jake Sulley's son finds his own sense of belonging in a new clan much like Jake did. He finds a spark of romance, a creature to bond with, and a difficult relationship to resolve, this time with his father as he is second son who is too often stepping out of line. The character journey feels familiar, but it is different. And there is the sense that much lies ahead for the character in any additional film, probably as the franchise's new protagonist.And a good move too, as with the film's heavy CGI use it sounds feasible to expect another lengthy wait time. And as Avatar 1 and 2 makes clear, an aging cast puts some constraint on how long the movie takes, as there was some de-aging special effects going on. If it takes another number of years, perhaps it's for the best to involve a new cast.While Avatar 2 sort of feels like two different projects merged into one (the sequel to the first film, and the basis for a third or an offshoot film), it is still a James Cameron film, and has classic moments within it. There's the merciless mechanical action like on Terminator, then claustrophobic sinking ship sequences like on Titanic. Some snappy one-liners, ethereal music, and of course, an ending credits pop song...I did also see this movie in an imax 3D movie theater with 3D glasses. That was a fun and immersive experience as there's lot of swimming fish, burning embers, some holographic screens, etc. Nice but not absolutely necessary."
"I enjoyed this sequel much more than I remember enjoying the first Avatar film back in 2009. It's not that the storyline is anything fresh or mind blowing, but that there are so many elements to the movie that are done so well. As expected, it's a visually captivating film. I made sure to see it on the biggest screen possible. I wasn't disappointed. The underwater sequences in IMAX 3D made this movie more than a story, it's an experience. There were times when it really gave me the sense of being under water. James Cameron knew he was giving us something beautiful to look at, so he made sure there are plenty of scenes just showing off the scenery, colors and interesting sea life. But The Way of Water is more than just a treat for the eyes.When the action really takes off during the final third of the film, it's thrilling. I would even describe the battle action as epic. It's surprisingly brutal given its PG-13 rating. The story even managed to make me a bit emotional as my eyes welled up with tears a couple of times. The Way of Water has a daunting 3 hour and 12 minute runtime, but to its credit, it didn't feel that long. I was very pleased with how well this sequel works as a standalone. I haven't seen the first Avatar film since that first time in 2009, but this film made me want to go back and finally watch it again. I think this may be a case where I will like the original film more as a prequel to this one."
"If you are a person who doesnt go to the theater very ofter like me, this time you should go out and enjoy this marvellous movie. Trust me there is nothing boring about Pandora. All the scenes are crafted to perfetion. And if there is not so much action like the first its only because Cameron keeps it for the next movies. I believe they will make sense in the end. This time the plot moves to the sea and its beauty and emphasises the dangers we humans create. Only reason i dont give a 10 is because none of the characters felt important. Actually in the end i ve come to like the bad guy!Apart from that i ve had a blast. Every few minutes there are moments of unmatched artistry. This film is way ahead of its similar budget marvel movies so im kinda dissapointed that it seems it wont cross them in the box office."
"What can one say about a much trumpeted movie which is visually spectacular, full of VFX, but falls short of presenting a gripping screenplay. . One feels that 3 hour 12 minutes run time could be one reason for it to sag at many points but then there was the same director's Titanic at 3 hour 14 minutes which had a captivating story and which was hugely entertaining and absorbing. Compared to this movie, the earlier ""Avatar"" at 2hr 45 mins was well made and universally liked by audiences This movie needed to be trimmed by at least 30 minutes but I find writer cum directorJames Cameron listed as one of the 4 editors, so probably this was difficult. However every James Cameron movie is always a path breaker and a cause for celebration due to it's scale and presentation including this one minus its shortcomings.If someone were to give an example to show that high class production design, mesmerizing spectacle and jaw dropping special effects by themselves ( minus a strong story , dialogue) cannot make a riveting movie , then this would be it. Not possible that an intelligent director likeJames Cameron is not aware of this aspect. The plot struggles to get on the rails for the first one hour and the last one hour is one long extended adventure on the sea. The pace is slow in most places and emotions of the characters ( though understated ) keep running high. There is some amazing underwater cinematography but then again the excess of blue hues ( blue water, blue men, women, children) becomes jarring after some time. The adventures of the sky people in the earlier version were better than the reef people here. The scenes here were predictable and clichéd too and so was the action which was highly familiar.."

Then I heard there was more movies coming... I won't bother with these till it's on Disney+Basically make new stuff not sequels to films that don't need it. Disappointed in James for even doing these and not spawning something newer."
"They jump into the story too quickly and it took me awhile to figure out who was who. Navi look alike.The best part of the picture is the midsection where we have the sea and it's fascination. Precious little violence. The bookends are much the same. One guy's revenge pursuit. Plenty of action all reminiscent of the old westerns turned on their head. Bad white guys pursuing good Indians. The Indian mythology wears a bit thin. As does the bad humans theme. The dialog was so ""American"" and slangy that I wondered where the Indigenous folk had picked it up from. ""Bro?"" It's eye candy that rings hollow."
"Avatar: The Way of Water is a lot like the original Avatar: a visual spectacle with some of the best (if not the best) CGI at the time and fantastic action sequences set in a truly remarkable alien world. It also suffers from some of Avatar's problems: it's characters, story, and ideas are definitely lacking and keep the proceedings from being truly memorable.Yet, Way of Water doesn't suffer *as much* as Avatar did. Take the characters; Cameron made the right decision to keep the humans and the adult Na'vi off screen for most of the movie, focusing instead of children and teens as they explore the aquatic lifestyle of the Metkayina clan. This was such a good decision; you can expect more whimsy and wonder, more childish conflicts, more heightened emotions. It doesn't come off as bad writing when characters need to have things really spelled out for them.When we do see the humans, it's honestly refreshing and a reminder of the bigger world outside of our characters' bubble. Hell, the one human character I was certain I'd hate, Spider, (played by Jack Champion) a human born amongst the Na'vi who speaks like how an adult thinks a teenage boy would speak maybe 20 years ago, was surprisingly compelling as a character. Stephen Lang's return as an Avatar was not only surprising but a great decision; he ended up given the villain role a bit more of a personal touch and it heightened the eventual confrontation with Jake Sully towards the end. Neteyam, Jake Sully's son, is effectively our protagonist and he was a genuinely good one; I can't tell you the last time I've seen fatherhood and brotherhood explored in a big budget blockbuster in this way, and it's no wonder this aspect of the story resonates with people.So yeah, there's some good story telling in Avatar 2, even if this franchise has yet to find its Luke Skywalker, Harry Potter, or Iron Man, the characters aren't going to be remembered and are still more ""reasons"" to get to the visuals and set pieces rather than compelling people.And, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that this story is essentially the same as the original film, almost beat for beat. I think I can forgive this film for doing this given the 13 year gap. But the next Avatar HAS to improve in the story area. I'd love to get the human perspective more; them being cartoonishly evil, yet always seeming to be the underdog in every confrontation will inevitably get old. There are also a lot of logical issues in the movie; why are the humans so obsessed with Pandora? Why can't they just send Na'vi super soldiers into the battle and conquer the planet from afar? Why are the Na'vi just constantly portrayed as perfect and in tune with nature, don't they have any internal conflicts? Couldn't the Na'vi have technologically adapted in the decades since the first film?Also, we need to acknowledge how bad of a decision it was for the clearly senior Sigourney Weaver to play Kiri, her in film daughter, given that she well, sounds like an old woman portraying a teenager. It gets flat out hilarious towards the end as Kiri speaks more and more and it becomes weirder and weirder.But, Way of Water really excels when it comes to the visual spectacle. In a lot of ways - and I mean this in the best way - this film feels like a video game. We have lots of downtime just exploring the world and meeting characters, which reminded me of open world adventure games. The set pieces punctuate the film and are truly glorious, and the entire time, I could see how easy it would be to turn this movie into a pretty fun video game.So yeah, Way of Water is better than the first, but it's still quite lacking in the story department. I think i can speak for the majority of audiences who will give this film a pass, but really don't want to see the same thing again next time. We need more complexity. More plot, and more interesting characters."
"I had been waiting for this movie for years just for it to come out the day I started quarantine in china, but two weeks later I've finally gotten the chance to see it. When the first avatar came out the visuals were unprecedented and James Cameron set the standard on that front; it was hard to imagine he'd repeat that feat but he has. Everything is bigger and better, you can see that it was all put together to look cool because almost every scene was visually captivating. As a result of that the story isn't mind blowing or on par as the visual effects. It was also the first time since covid I watched a movie with a mask on and 3d glasses together and I get why people who wear glasses complain about them fogging up.I loved that it still had social and cultural commentary just like the first which was 'inspired' by the conflicts between natives and European military groups in South America during colonial times. Everything the first movie did well, this went 3 steps further. I loved the children's characters arcs, and to a lesser extent the history with the main antagonist despite being unimaginative villain. They must really love Stephen Lang to keep refusing to let him die. Spider felt like a late addition, didn't care as much for him even though his character was meant to play an integral part it always felt he was an afterthought when he showed up, underdeveloped.I am a die hard avatar fan but I do still see flaws, and I preface this with that the visuals made up and make the flaws seem more minor for me. As I said everything the first movie did well is done even better; same can be said for it's shortcomings. Story and characters are underdeveloped and that coupled with how cliche they are doesn't bode well, so for the many of those who didn't like the first avatar for such reasons won't be impressed with way of the water. And of course it's a ridiculously long as well but I enjoyed every minute of it. Plot wise it could literally be an hour shorter but why, I wouldn't want that, I wanna awe at pandora as long as I can, and even though the pacing isn't as good as the first I was still at the edge of my seat for all of it. It just happened that the plot was pretty lazily written. However with three more movies lined up in the making, they really need to step it up in the writing department, can't keep leaning on the visuals. Acting was great from everyone but the chemistry between characters could be written better to actually exuberate the emotions; the only reason I knew the characters cared for each other is it's narrated to us that they're family.Everything the first movie did well, The Way of Water did better, and everything that was underwhelming about the first was once again repeated. James Cameron only worked on avatar's strengths so despite being bigger and better, the movie still is more of the same. Felt like style over substance but the style was enough for me to overlook what it lacked."
"Finally got round to seeing ""Avatar 2"" after a busy Christmas, hearing mixed things about it and not being sure I could handle the 3 hours sitting watching it. But I've got to say I'm on the side of those praising it. Thinking it's equel to the first.The effects are of course still up there, and there's some excellent bonus underwater stuff. But it's a better story and the characters are better. The beginning is a bit of a stretch. But I got more into what was going on overall this time around. So it's got what any effects movie should have plus the great visuals on top of that.I was invested in what was happening to all the new kid characters here. As I knew there was too many of them for them all to make it. I usually can't be doing with too many annoying kid characters in a movie, but they all made for a less predictable plot.Plus I'm always won over by a good bad guy and this one has that great snarling villian. They're also the best character done in motion capture. Really adding an extra something to the movie."
"I've always really struggled with 3hr movies as you don't have that home comfort at the cinema, but on this occasion it was so engrossing end to end that it seems like a two hour sitting.Stunning visuals throughout and beautiful underwater scenes.Not too much action like those silly comic movies, elegant overview of native life, and more importantly a life lesson on the brutal invasion of visitors whom true to choke and bully the native residents into submission, while ironically calling those natives, savages.True insight into what happens when capitalism is left unchecked/moderated by leaders with integrity."
"No matter what people say, I enjoyed Avatar 1 both visually and story wise. I really got connected to the characters. This movie is just visually very great but after first half it feels like where is the twist, like visual experience get normal after few minutes as it's what we had expected but the story is what people need to engage to 3hrs10min movie. Story wise i really got bored. If you want to show visual effect just make a documentary of 1.5 hrs including avatars. Don't ruin the movie arc for the people, just end it on a good note. Many plot holes are there which was very irritating, it feels like they want to just finish this movie."
"I loved this movie. The CGI was amazing and the plot was even better. Would definitely recommend to anyone, regardless of their preference in genre. Performances were emotional and compelling. The natural wonders of Pandora were beautiful. It did not feel like a three hour movie. Definitely a movie to see in the cinema. I saw the HFR version in 3D and it was fantastic. So good to see an amazing movie in a full cinema. Would definitely go to see another Avatar sequel if it was as good as The Way of Water. If you read this review and have not seen this movie go see it in a cinema. It is worth ti!"
"Visually its a 10/10 experience- you need to see the Film in cinema in 3D -to Fully embrace the experience.But the Story is 0815 and very simple - there are also some major plotholes and if you are thinking about them during watching the movie you May dislike the movie. Its a movie to see one time only in cinema for the visuals but you probably wont have the need to revisit the movie. 10/10 visuals but 5 or 6/10 storyline, because you have seen it a 1000 times already.In conclusion the Film left me with a bitter taste because i really wanted to enjoy the movie - but the Story is not developing at all from the 2009 movie..."
"Avatar the way of the water has definitely met my expectations, and I enjoyed every single moment.This movie is visually stunning and straight up gorgeous, every single movie shot has your mind blown. The storyline itself is great but it's nothing you wouldn't expect. The characters had good depth, but there were some characters that felt a bit unnecessary, like spider. Spider did set up the next avatar movie but it felt like that was his only purpose. The acting work was great although it's hard to rate because of the cgi.Overal a beautiful movie with some mind grasping moments, looking forward to avatar 3."
"Avatar is a film you attend purely for visual immersion. It's sparkly and magical like the first film, but with more water this time. Narratively it needed a good 45 minute trim, about two less kid characters, and the addition of coherence. In the first film, the evil humans were relentlessly after magical ore to meet our energy needs. In this film, the humans are back ... but to colonize Pandora, since we've apparently trashed Earth. Moving on from this mission well into the second act, the focus shifts to whale hunting, for the purpose of getting anti-aging oil. Except these are the same humans that can download our entire memories into a computer chip and rebuild a new alien body that is capable of reproduction. Also, the military will spend millions regenerating an unhinged colonel whose only purpose is personal revenge, entailing the death of dozens of other military and para-military types and the loss of their armada and supplies in the process. There's a lot of this type of convenience plotting that does nothing other than to move characters to one crisis from another. Don't go for any insight, just go to imagine how cool it would be to ride dragons."
"No wonder, it took them 13 years to come out with this, as I pity all the computers that had to render the visuals. Everything from the last and the most negligible details looks real. It is soo good that from all the 4 stars I gave for this movie, all 4 of them is the CGI and the way that it looks. The story is 90% copy paste and I know we have to pay attention to the envirement nowadays but in a movie this much recycled element is a joke. The dialouge is bad. And I mean atrociously bad. The characters are week as hell. Either you are good like Jesus Christ himsefl or you are as evil Darth Sidious. And we got the same exact villain with on of the weekeset motiation I've ever seen. The kids are cringy as hell as always in a hollywood blockbuster, but this movie has a lot of them in it and they are kind of the main characters so expect a lot of suffering when seeing them on screen. And the duality comes from here because you are blown away in the opposite direections at the same time. You hear them interacting and acting but you are looking at such a great CGI that you won't know what to think.If you watch this at home in a year, you are going to laugh how bad it is, but If you want to see what our technology can do nowadays with visuals I think it's over the moon in that regard."
"An event! This 3 hour story should be treated as such. Sink in and get lost in the story. I know the length is a source of contention, but some movies are worth the minutes. Some movies need the minutes. So often I watch an hour and a half long movie and I'm thinking 'what, we've missed so much.' Don't get so caught up in the time. You've likely sat through many 2hr30minutes+ films before. Plus, it's the generation of binging anyway.Maybe it was predictable, maybe it didn't dive real deep (but actually it did ha!), but it was relatable. Family, changes, standing up for good, fighting for good when needed, and a reminder that each life is so important.Also, a reminder that selfishness / over using of resources is such a careless move. It's clear as day when we show it in a fictional story that spans 3 hours, yet it's difficult to understand in lives that last 100 years but are only focused on the next 10 days.Anyway, what it lacks in predictability, it makes up for in beautiful visuals and good acting.I enjoyed! I was amazed by the water ties and loved each character. No character felt like a fill in.I would love to see more from Kiri and more about what happened to the Forest clans. I think there was so strings left untied that may lead to more movies. I'll be buying tickets again."
"The story is about humans wanting something they can extract from the planet to sell back on earth as it's valuable. And sully, the main character, goes to this tribe to learn their ways, such as how to hunt and rise their local animals. It all ends in a big fight scene where one of the local animals that's bigger than the other ones defends the Navi.Sorry that's avatar 1. I meant to review Avatar 2. The story is about humans wanting something they can extract from the planet to sell back on earth as it's valuable. And sully, the main character, goes to this tribe to learn their ways, such as how to hunt and rise their local animals. It all ends in a big fight scene where one of the local animals that's bigger than the other ones defends the Navi.You catch my drift. It's basically the first movie."
"I see this not as a traditional movie, but more of an experience. An emotional and visual ride. A dive back into what it's like existing in and experiencing Pandora as if it were the first time. It's like traveling to a foreign land... leave expectations behind and let it take you on a trip.The story is actually quite simple and it really is all about family. Like in the first film, I really connected with the aspects of what it's like feeling like an outsider.There are moments that drag a little and could've been edited shorter. But all in all I found myself audibly gasping at how stunning some scenes were to behold and I also became very emotional at specific moments. The acting is superb especially from Zoe Saldana.If you enjoyed the first film this is a must watch. It's worth it for the jaw dropping visuals alone. Watch it in IMAX 3D if you can."
"Another visual masterpiece from James Cameron. The Avatar films have been ones that I see for the visuals themselves and not the actual story and once again, the visuals are absolutely incredible. I'm glad that Cameron decided to hold off on making this movie until the technology was there because it really shows but it can be weird at times. Whenever the characters go underwater, it feels like the film was shot on the world's best IPhone. I mean that as both a positive and negative. The visuals look amazing but the frame rate is different and makes it feel weird. As beautiful as the underwater scenes are, it can be jarring when we go back to the surface as the frame rate is different. As with the first Avatar as well, the story is okay. In fact, the story is a little bit worse here as it feels like a 2 hour movie stretched to 3. The characters and acting are kind of all over the place here quality wise. Some of the acting is good like Zoe Saldaña and Kate Winslet but other actors like Sam Worthington aren't doing a great job but Sam Worthington's character is great here but Kate Winslet's doesn't feel important (for now). While the story is just okay, I'm not going to an Avatar movie for the story and I'm going for the visuals and since the visuals are so good then I feel satisfied with the movie. If James Cameron keeps making visually spectacular movies then I'll keep showing up. If you enjoyed the first Avatar or want a visually breathtaking movie then I would definitely check this out."
"We saw Avatar 2 last night and was a bit dissapointed. Basically there was nothing new. No deeper story - just a kind of copy of the first movie. Too much war and no deeper story.There were some errors and strange decisions. In the end the water tribe helps them fight the sky people, but suddenly they were gone. Where did they go? Same with the outcast whale. Helps in the beginning og then it dissapears.We also wonder that the water tribe in the end says that Sully and Neytiri now are a part of them. So what about Neytiri's family and where she comes from?When Kiri gets sick - out of nowhere Norm just arrives. But how? Sully and Neytiri were long away from home.Spider is unnecessary. So the cool army man just gets a kid with another woman? Unprofessional and strange.We saw the movie in 3D, but there were no cool effects.Hopefully no 3 will be better, else it will be buried."
"You can hate all you want about the plot or characters not being good enough, it is a must-watch in 3D in a cinema, it's a great experience and the ""bad"" about it doesn't drag it down to it not being worthy to watch that way. You could argue if the movie would still be that good without 3D, but neither is that the recommendation I am giving nor was it an experience that I had. The production is on a very high level, if not the highest we have at the moment. Action scenes were visually stunning and not repetitive. I don't think any character was cringe, they all played well. Towards the half of the movie it felt a little bit dragging, but it got better. Maybe if you are jaded with 3D movies you could give it a bad rating, but all I can say is that I had a great time and it is awesome to see what is possible with the technology we have nowadays."
"After waiting for more than 12 years, I expect something more. Honestly, the story is not creative and boring. I understand that Pandora is beautiful and the graphic is the strength of Avatar, but I don't need to see it for more than 50% of the movie duration without moving forward to the plot. There are many interesting things that add to the story that can be answered or simply cut the duration. Many things don't make sense anyway. The premise that leads to the 'way of water' is ridiculous. The movie is too humanized, predictable, and has no creativity. James Cameron was one of my favorite directors, but this movie changes everything."
"In most of adventure/action stories there is always an element which either doesn't get enough exposure or doesn't quite gel with the setting.What is most remarkable about Avatar, The Way of Water is how seamlessly this story evolves. Everything is tuned to become a quite complex thread where story lines, acting, photography, special effects, sound and music all have the same importance and exposure.Considering the length it took to produce a much improved follow up to the initial Avatar, it is incredible how everyone involved has managed to keep so alert to avoid any mistake. A recurrent problem when working for a very long time to the same project.Presumably the project vision of the Director must have provided always the right direction.It is well worth going to watch the 3D version although in some screenings a 4 Extreme show is offered and I guess that it is not going to disappoint.I enjoyed every moment of the fully immersive experience of Avatar, The Way of Water and although there are stories on a much smaller scale which will be able to transport you in fantastic worlds, if there is a title which will stay in the story of cinema as what such experience is , a journey in a story which will make you forget about everything else in a theatre with strangers, it will be Avatar, The Way of Water."
"It was a great experience I dont want the story to be so complex but I want the movie like this only this set a bar for movie experience nothing can be capaired with this.i like the ""amrita"" mention which is a sanskrit word from India my country I like the way James Cameron's mind works and he imagines these places landscape and love the way Jake sully and family shown in this. I want to watch more of this world. And if they can also show some if the earth that how earth is not habitable for humans anymore and how human are coming here with that kind of advanced technology and also who discovered the pandora."
"The most important thing about the movie is the lack of plot. I mean it has no meaning at all and it's so predictable! The dialogue is at best poor with repetitive phrase like ""I see you"" and ""the way of water"" to try and give us a deep meaning for no apparent reason. Also,
The effects are not up to the hype that has been created. I didn't see any meaningful difference in the 3D way, it felt like 2009 again. In addition the 3D wasn't constant, some scenes were like there was no 3D effect. Lastly, the duration of 3 hours + serves no purpose for that weak of a plot.All in all, I don't thing I will ever see any avatar again as it cannot ""give"" you anything at all!"
"The follow up to the original where Sully's family moves to the water tribe to avoid drawing danger to their people.There is a lot this movie does right: world-building, thoughtful character and creature designs, pacing, family dynamics, the focus on the kids, the way parallelism with real colonial history, setting up for future instalments.There are things this movie does wrong: not enough focus on Jake or Neytiri, bringing back Quaritch, maybe too much action.Overall, I think it is a very slight improvement over the original. On one hand, this movie is a little less focused, but it is more enjoyable - which is why most people go to the movies anyway."
"I would have given 10 but with its length I think it overstretched by at least 1 hour. So 3 star deducted .James Cameroon i felt overdid this time on length .story wise it has referred to 5 elements according to hinduism .First one he covered earth now water with remaining 3 to come in it can very well focus on fire,wind and space .Story wise it turned out to be personal revenge story rather than focusing on destruction of Pandora this time water .Visually no one can counter this movie .a spectacle to watch .Had director reduced the length by 1 hour it would have been an ideal watch.However hats off to magician James Cameroon only he can pull of the winner in this 5 part mega movie series ."
"I read a lot of reviews from multiple sources before watching this and so expected somewhat of a let-down from the expectations that may have built up over the years.So the review title says it all. I guess I have watched the first Avatar movie about 5 times after watching it at the cinema all those years ago. I will NOT watch this one again though.I watched Avatar 2 at IMAX full laser screen. I was surprised how the 3D seemed in no way better than the first one .... I actually kept noticing poor sharpness and definition regularly and remembered how in reviews, some people advised to watch in Dolby laser screen, but that option was not around for me. How has it taken 13 years to make this cartoon which seems no better in technological terms than the first one?There where a lot of annoying cliches.... ALOT....and I found myself putting my head in my hands at times or laughing at things that were supposed to be serious and sad, because of the cliche aspect.I almost walked out a few times.....the first half I felt that I was glad to have finally made the choice to watch the movie, but the second half became just overload of explosions and military stuff in a child like way. I'm a 46 year old man and I can watch military movies, explosions etc.....if the movie is good. But when it's full of childish cliches and childish script writing......it's just tiresome and takes a lot of energy from the human body with all the loud explosions and shouting and 3D activity of more explosions etc. I closed my eyes for many minutes on multiple occasions during the second half.I found some of the acting good and certain aspects of the movie or characters very interesting and well done and there were a few valuable life lessons in the story....mainly for children to understand that not following a parents safety advice repeatedly, can have serious repercussions.All in all, because I was tired from a hard physical workout this morning, I feel it was worth going to the cinema to watch this. But still.....something in me also feels I lost an afternoon of life, where I could have been practicing meditation or something. So it's a proverbial strange cup of tea.....a mix of some quality ingredients and some poor and overall it doesen't really work and doesen't really leave one feeling satisfied, especially given what it might have been if a less commercially money orientated Director had been at the helm. The movie really does feel over-ally designed for commercial purposes."
"3 hours of pure joy.I am so surprised by the lower ratings people have given for this film. I was worried from some reviews that I'd be disappointed in this movie, but I left the IMAX 3D cinema crying (I cried around 7 or 8 times throughout this film). It was perfect from start to finish! So much better than the first one, and so much better visually, it was stunning. I've never given a movie a 10/10 before but for this one I had to as I could not fault it. Incredible filming, directing and scoring. Action scenes was spot on, the storyline was excellent and the script was great. I can't wait for the next one to come out!"
"I had options, to either watch this movie or to visit the national museum..i chose this movie over the museum...well...to put it bluntly, i feel like i was watching 2:30hrs of screensaver playback, the remaining minutes' filled by the storyline and post credits. I was anticipating it's release for quite sometime, but i feel the story line's too thin. I was also trying to gather, for the earlier part of the story, who was who (apart from Jake and his wife). In the whole of the movie, i found no climax. Was i expecting much? Could be, the visuals were great..but for a long time coming, the story could have been better with more depth and a better ending. I was truly disappointed. I should've gone to the museum instead."
"Watch it for the CGI cartoonish visual eye candy and turn the volume down so as not to let the sappy story line spoil it. The story is predictable and frankly the visuals are not much better than the first Avatar. If the dialog only could be silenced only that would be an even better version.Avatar is a great example of how Hollywood is addicted to computer generated visuals with voice over dialog. In this case, once again, man bad alien good. Predictable, sappy, lazy, too long and boring. A real sleep inducer.The only real difference between 1 and 2 versions is #1 is go'ith by land and #2 is go'ith by sea. A 5 rating is generous."
"Very long film, boring and dry in areas. Good final fight however in general, predictable and elongated. The story line is based around the family and the longer term film franchise vision, it doesn't really pack any punch. The middle area of the film is incredibly long and dry. The beginning and end are the best parts. It's a shame about this film as the first hosted a great platform however the 2nd certainly fails to deliver. Cameron has produced some stunning visuals but ultimately, great visuals does not make a good film. In ways, the components of the film were there however they were not put together correctly. Maybe I'm wrong.... But I'm harsh on films...."
"The sad second edition to Avatar. It is truly magic for the eyes as the production crew create a truly beautiful world. This is the only highlight of the movie. There's zero emotional connection to the characters who never seem to develop in any way. One character in particular was especially painful each second they were on screen. Sadly, the dialogue was poorly written and poorly executed - Jake's children say ""bro"" at least 50 times like their at Bondi Beach and not on Pandora. Jake remains the only character with a memorable name in the whole movie. Odd moments through the film ruin the overall story (which is totally predictable as expected) - why are the whales so important? Why does a girl have epilepsy diagnosed for a scene which then never returns?A movie you'll never want to watch again."
"Despite being incredibly beautiful the movie showed great meaning and did a good amount of story building setting up for what I assume with be a super intense final two movies. I understand that people may not enjoy the fact that less happened, but I like to think of it as a stepping stone. Only parts I did not enjoy were the the big fish, not the friendly big fish and you'll know what I mean, scene just looked bad. I also did not like the character spider one bit. Horrible acting and it was a mistake to have him so integral to the story. I think that having no true main character was something that made the movie feel organic. It was a surprising thing during the movie but after a while you just don't think about it anymore because James Cameron has captivated you so intensely!"
"After over 13 years, James Cameron finally makes his return to the big screen, with 'Avatar: The Way of Water', the sequel to the highest grossing film of all time. And after seeing the film a few days ago, I would say that this film is a visual marvel, and a breathtaking experience. However, this film does have its share of issues.One thing I loved while watching the film was the experience it provided for the audience. With the visual effects team, James Cameron's directing, and the score giving it their all throughout the film, it makes the experience of seeing it almost unforgettable. Experiencing the Sully family adapt to the Metkayina's lifestyle and learning what is considered 'The Way of Water' was a visual treat. The film didn't even feel that long. I did feel the length briefly at some points, like when Lo'ak being abandoned at sea. But for the most part, this film had me hooked for most of the film.The finale of the film, while derivative of Cameron's other works (via 'Titanic'), it's still a visual marvel, and was immensely more intense than the first film's finale, and had more stakes, due to the death of Neteyam. Even while I saw this film in a regular format, it was still a fantastic experience, thanks to the visuals, the directing, score, and the sound.I may sound like I love this film, but I do have some issues with it, mainly within the script. My main issue with the writing was how it was derivative from the first film, and the plot did feel a bit repetitive. It took many of the same beats as the first film, like the family adapting to the Metkayina's way of life, Lo'ak acting impulsive, and a brief conflict between Jake and a tribe.It also felt a bit repetitive at points, with Lo'ak constantly taking risks, Jake Sully lecturing his kids, and with them facing conflict with the Metkayina. It didn't completely take me out of the film, but it did bother me a bit.Even besides his problems, Lo'ak did grow on me throughout the film, due his character arc being realized near the end, Kiri and her conflict involving her abilities, and Zoe Saldana's acting.Overall, it's a flawed film, with a repetitive and derivative script, but was a great experience. Easily one of, if not the best movie-going experiences of 2022."
"Avatar: The Way of Water is a great Sequel to the groundbreaking original. Masterclass cgi and a solid story fullfill the high expectations.Story:
The Way of Water introduces the Water Tribe to the audience which is created with a lot of love. They have their own rituals and traditions and that is shown perfectly. This movie is not the last of the series so dont expect a big climax here. It has a solid finale and helps to build up the climax that will come with Avatar 5 (!). Therefore that it is 3 hours long the pacing is great. (7/10)Acting:
Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana in the main roles are great like in the original. The antagonist is also well depicted. With all the cgi it is not as easy for the actors to show their talents, but it is though satisfying. (6/10)Music:
Well, the soundtrack of the movie is good, but a blockbuster like this deserves more. In my case the cinema I watched the movie played ""Victory"" by Two Steps From Hell before the start of the movie and this is how a masterclass soundtrack works. They should have hired Hans Zimmer or so for such a big event. (5/10)Visuals:
Well this movie sets the benchmark high in case of graphics. The Last Time I saw this beauty in a movie would be 2020's Dune or 2019's Rise of Skywalker. Unfortunately nowadays the graphics are getting worse (Yes, I mean you MARVEL!) so it is great to see this quality. It's quite as good as the cgi in videogames!Genre:
As a science fiction movie it has a great world, we already know of the original. But it expands this world with the water tribe and you have the feeling that every creature or technology was created with love and makes sense. (8/10)Verdict:Avatar: The Way of Water is far better than I have expected it to be. In my opinion it's even better than the original. James Cameron proved again that he knows how to make blockbuster movies!(7/10)"
"I have to be upfront with you: I am a huge fan of the original Avatar film. So even these 13 years of excruciating wait and several release reschedules couldn't separate The Way of Water from its predecessor for me. This will undoubtedly create a bias, and people who saw TWoW without seeing the original film might view it differently. Still, it is a sequel, and I am evaluating it as one.First, the good stuff. The film is absolutely gorgeous! Moving from land to sea gave Cameron the opportunity to put his imagination to work and use his obvious love for the marine world to create a vibrant and mesmerising underwater universe. The original Avatar made many of us shed tears of pure joy and fall deeply in love with the living and breathing world of Pandora, and I couldn't deny TWoW a few deserved tears of bliss from just letting myself be immersed.And this is where the problems begin. If The Way of Water was a BBC documentary, I'd give it a solid 10 for showing the beauty of this dream planet. But the first film was so much more than that. Its plot might be predictable, but it had genuine characters, believable drama of their interaction, ups and downs that took us through the whole gamut of emotions, from absolute happiness of a childhood dream coming true to anger and rage of witnessing cruelty and atrocities beyond redemption and forgiveness.And this is exactly where TWoW feels surprisingly detached. At first, it's not even clear why, as the film clearly tries to play a very similar tune to its predecessor's. If you watch the sequel when your memory of the original Avatar is still fresh, you'll notice those reflections immediately, from iconic moments like freestyle flight sequences or merry interactions with harmless but whimsical wildlife, to the soundtrack fragments and even catchphrases like ""You're not in Kansas anymore"".But something's still missing. And, in my opinion, it's the characters' relatability. The first Avatar showed us an alien world full of alien creatures, but we saw it from humans' perspective, even if those humans were acting through their Pandora-verse counterparts. Jake Sully, Dr Augustine and others, they were still embedded in the reality that we recognise as ours, and this created a much deeper sense of compassion, empathy and even tragedy when you could see a person twisted and pulled apart by his physical nature and emotions and feelings stuck somewhere between the two worlds.In TWoW though, (almost) all characters are alien. Not just because they are tall and blue, but because they belong to Pandora now. The tie is severed, and no amount of adopted human weapons and gadgetry can change that. They frolic underwater or partake in the communal drama, but it's no longer an ""us and them"" type of story, it's mostly just ""them"". The filmmakers try to bypass this alienation by legitimising English as the default language, but instead of making things better it just blurs away the contrast between humans and Na'vi even more, akin to that old movie tradition of making the characters speak the same language regardless of their origin, something that modern filmmaking tries to stay away from to make the diversity more pronounced.Moving from the forest environment to the water one doesn't help either. We humans are mostly land species. Polynesian fishermen tribes might disagree, but I'm not sure if there's an IMAX theatre anywhere near their villages. And those who can appreciate Cameron's new work probably found sounds of a rainforest more soothing and whale songs in a distance. Which makes TWoW even more of a ""peculiar customs of a far-away land's dwellers"", that is, even less relatable. The final battle scene does attempt to bring back our engagement, borrowing from other cult stories such as Moby Dick or even self-citing Titanic or Aliens, but this feels so artificial and contrived that I couldn't help but cringe a little.I am sure that Cameron was aware of this obvious distance between the story and the viewer, so several characters were introduced in attempt to bridge it. Kiri, a female nod to the immaculate conception story, will probably play a more central role in the upcoming sequels, but at the moment is hardly more than a confused ugly duckling picked at by its tribe. And a reincarnation of Quaritch, a bit of a soot and tar caricature of a villain whom the story tries to imbue with an inner complexity but so far uses as a mere tool to create something that resembles a conflict to propel the story forward. Maybe the investment will pay off in the future, but so far these characters are seriously inconsistent, underdeveloped and, to be honest, quite flat.And finally there's Spider. The only human that makes sense and makes a difference this time. A boy who's almost like a wayward tree spirit that just hangs around for some reason, he's the only link connecting ""us"" to ""them"" that seems to work. His actions are erratic, motivations unclear, but most of us can relate to this semi-feral boisterous and fiercely loyal kid. Spider is the kind of sidekick that enables the protagonist and makes him or her believable, and, if not for him, I'm afraid we'd be completely lost in the world of TWoW without a reliable interpreter.There's more to be said about certain story inconsistencies that are too apparent in this film, regardless of your willingness to suspend disbelief. But that's mostly nitpicking compared to the main issue I have with TWoW. Which is that, unlike its predecessor, the film didn't take me on a magical ride that would be worth waiting loyally for more than a decade to see the next chapter. Luckily, we don't have to do this kind of waiting anymore. So, while I'm not astonished in awe of what I've seen, there is still hope that there will be more in stock for Cameron than pretty luminescent imagery and self-repetition."
"Wow...I had such high hopes for this film after 13 years. I was let down at every turn. The plot...if you want to call it that is just a revenge story that should have been scrapped after review. Seriously. We had 13 years and 3hrs and 10 minutes to craft a badass plot and we get nothing. John Wick has a better story. There was just too much time spent on the wrong things and there was never a return to the original theme of mining the planet for its resources. The film is visually stunning so much so you tend to forget the characters are CGI. However, there is no story after all this time. I was expecting more."
"13 years, and I think it was worth the wait. But the next one would need to come a bit sooner please! It's the world of Avatar that is amazing.Visually, the movie is just breathtaking. The amounts of details and how they made everything work. Hats off to all the visual creators, staff and the actors that went through all that hard work to making it!It was a real treat and the world of Avatar never felt more alive.With the story. The introduction of new characters was super well done, you felt for every character there and seeing Jake, Neytiri and others back in action along the new characters, just felt very in sync!It's a long sit, but very worth it. Some might think it's too long, but this also gives time within the movie for downtime, where it doesn't need to be always on the fly and in action. It's good to see they took time to make the viewer be part of this visual spectacle.Can't wait for the next one!"
"Well, this movie was a disappointment.I liked Avatar 1; it had a thin story, but it had some character-developement for sully and revolutionary fx, so it was engaging enough to be a good flick.But Part 2 is an empty shell storywise. Fx are still great, but you have seen it equally nice in other movies. But the story..., oh boy...
No nuanced characters, no character-arc, only exposition in the dumbest way possible.The story is extremely boring, combine that with a 3-hour runtime, it was almost torture.I guess there were too much characters to ever have time to get connected to anyone, even in 3 hours. Less would have been more.If the story was at least mediocre, i would rate this film 7 Stars; sadly the story is a a lot worse.I would rate this movie as one of the worst i have ever seen.Despite i like Cameron-Movies, i definitely wont see part 3."
"Unbelievably long. Seems more a recording of a random video game session than something that started with a plot.The beauty and tension of the first movie is transmogrified into a smorgasbord of scenes - including a cruel paraphrasing of a whale hunt - with gratuitous violence with no sense, a story with a thin plot, lots of money thrown at special effects, a score that doesn't add anything meaningful. The physics in the movie seem to ignore fluid dynamics, and some avionics aerodynamics could have been more credible. The underwater scenes are nice as in surreally nice, but other than that...In summary, a movie designed by a committee..."
"Really looked forward to seeing this movie, very disappointed. Following interesting first 10 minutes it just seemed like an inferior copy of the original, albeit with new scenery & characters. There were around 20 customers sat within hearing distance of me and 12 departed within first hour. I did suffer to the end but wish Mr Cameron had used at least some of his budget to issue The Abyss & True Lies on Bluray, at least those movies were worth repeated viewing. Have to admit it is the very first James Cameron movie I have not enjoyed and wished to see again but this time I am not alone with my verdic."
"Despite having some cliches in the film , it was gorgeously done and it's absurdly watchable , it's gut-wrenching , sad and adventurous. I didn't expect some bad things that happened which got my by surprise and emotional , but I understand it made the story of the film stronger , it is a film which definitely makes me hate human race. The story is simple , but that's okay for me, it's beautiful , and the scenery is stunning and I'm at a loss of words by how much I enjoyed this film , I highly recommend it and support this movie entirely , it may not be perfect , but it's one of a kind , it's simple and yet complete , what else could you want from this masterpiece ?"
While Avatar 2 has a great worldbuilding and visuals it lacks consistency with the source material Why would eywa not attack the sky people as soon as they landed as eywa has seen jake sullys memorys and how the sky people destroyed their own world? In my opinion the sky people should have used graces finds of eywas biological makeup to make some type of wepon that wuld disable the global biological network that binds Pandora together and then eywa culd manifest in graces baby exsplaing her powers and allso seizures since anny vesal probely wuld be to weak for Eywas power . After this the story could have played out much the same but instead of Jakes son dying of a bullet shot he could die as one of the hostages showing that miles means business miles had so manny opportunitys both to kill the hostages and jake. Jake and neytiri allso had the opportunity to attack miles together later in the movie.
"Three stars for the visuals, which are impressive. However, the story is straight trash. It's boring, cliche, and redundant. You need more than impressive visuals if you suspect people to be engaged in a movie for over three hours. By far the most frustrating character is Spider, who decides to save the main antagonist (which is sorta/kinda his father) of the franchise who will almost certainly continue to incite violence against every living thing on the planet in the next movie installments. He is a character that wasn't needed and feels very out of place. He is both a scared helpless child and a boastful braggart at other times, literally laughing in face of his captors who have him at gunpoint."
"Well, I expected the movie to be bad, as the first Avatar I considered nothing but a benchmark, but this gotta be one of the most dull and boring scripts a movie with this budget was capable of producing.You can tell a story in many, MANY ways, but they chosen to tell in the most dumb and childish way humanly possible. Dull characters, boring dialogues with a plot that does not develop well and barely makes any sense at all.If you like going to the movies to see a bunch of GPUs being used then this movie is for you, but if you're looking for a rich story and interesting narrative, then you are in the wrong place."
"Whoever wrote the plot of this movie is never invited to parties.Excluding the rest of the movie, which was incredibly beautiful and probs the most realistic one I've seen, my biggest problem is the villains design: they're not realistic, they're not organic, their choices don't make sense, instead they sound like the fictional arrangement of someone who never interacts with us, now political. The motivations of the villains are never realistic, it is said that they colonize this planet to get ""humans"" to live in: implying that earth is inhabitable.Pessimism is not awareness, it's a virus."
"Director focused so much on the VFX that he forgot about story, Story is all about personal revenge not related to the alien and human fight to vital extent. They focused more on the family drama then the action which the viewer would expect.Story evolves around the family matter of one person.If you watch in imax or in good 3D theater you will not get bored but after the end of movie you might feel terrible that the hype this movie has made. You would expect to the last minutes that some exciting alien vs human fight will happen. Ya upto the last minute but they have made this as a link between the 2009 Avtar and Avtar part 3. Ending was so boring."
"So I watched this movie 2 times in theatre today, the first time I watched it I got so distracted by the sheer amount of visual insanity being put up on the screen, honestly couldn't focus on the story at all. On my 2nd viewing tho, the movie got even better for me.Ok let's get the elephant in the room out of the way first. The Visuals - y'all know already this is a gorgeous looking movie. Anything I say will not justify how good each and every frame of this movie looks.Any scene that showed the underwater lands of Pandora looked unlike anything I have seen before. There are legit some shots in this film that I have no idea how they achieved, I didn't knew a shot that complex was achieveable even with morden technology, don't wanna think about the render times it's scaring me. From a visual standpoint, it's flawless. But this is the obvious stuff.What I wanna talk about is the plot. It's not the plot that I expected. Now that I have seen the movie 2 times, I realise that the story itself is actually really on a small scale. It is a very personal self contained story painted on the biggest canvas humanity has ever seen. The best way I can explain it without spoiling stuff, from a story stand point it felt like I was watching a really good episode of TV show.A majority of this film is all world building and honestly the story of this movie can be easily shown in like 2h 20 mins. There is about 30-40 mins that could be cut as they don't contribute anything to the story but I am glad they weren't because I will take all the time James Cameron allows me to stay in the world of Pandora.A major negetive I had with the first Avatar was everytime the movie focused on the humans, it got boring. But to my relief 90 percent of this film is blue people. There are barely any humans and there wasn't a point where I got bored, the pacing was better than its predecessor. The last 1 hour of this movie is absolute insanity, that's the only way I can describe it.Overall, the first time you watch this movie its an experience and it should be inside a movie theatre. Watching it on a small screen will absolutely not give you the same ""eyegasm"". From a visual standpoint it's flawless, but from a story standpoint it has its flaws but still it's an enjoyable ride. What it lacks in story, it makes over in ten folds with the visuals."
"After viewing the trailers and teasers, I was not thoroughly impressed and to me it looked like it was just a remake of the original Avatar with a slightly different plot. I waited three weeks before I bought a ticket. I'm so glad, I saw this movie and wished they had an IMAX version (minus the 3D because those glasses don't go well with my progressive lenses).Loved the visuals and the storyline kept me glued to my seat. Reintroducing the characters that died in the original movie was a novel idea and it totally worked. Same villain with the same vendetta but in a different body. It was fun watching Edie Falco play a badass."
"While I saw it as a child and rewatched it before seeing this film, I never cared much for the original Avatar. It was fine and impressive at the time, but it feels like watching a video game with a green screen nowadays. With that in mind, I wasn't expecting much from the long-awaited sequel. However, I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed it despite its very evident flaws and oddities.With technology having vastly improved, this franchise once again holds the title of having the most impressive visuals in cinema. Its hyper-realistic characters and scenery legitimately made me forget I was watching CGI motion capture rather than the actual actors.Ultimately, this movie recycles a lot from the original. Put simply, it's once again an exploration of a unique area of Pandora with a unique animal that the Na'vi are connected to.I did find the water tribe and the sea to be infinitely cooler to explore than the forest in the first movie. The relationship between the Metkayina clan and the Tulkum is very beautifully examined. Everything during this large chunk of the movie is so distinctively fascinating. I expected the movie to drag, but I didn't even check the time until the third act when it became more focused on action rather than world-building.To my surprise, seeing the film in IMAX 3D also made it vastly more immersive. This helped make scenes like Lo'ak being alone in foreign waters frightening.Another part of the movie that is blatantly rehashed from the first is the antagonists. Quaritch and his group being reanimated in clone avatar bodies feels so random. It's definitely one of the weirdest aspects of the movie. Equally as outlandish and out of nowhere is Grace's daughter Kiri, whose entire existence and seizure plot is left with nothing but unanswered questions. I'm convinced there must've been some deal to bring back all the stars from the first film that resulted in Quaritch and Grace returning.Spider's yet another inclusion that comes out of nowhere, but I do enjoy the character. He's a cool fish-out-of-water type, but him saving Quaritch was really annoying. The fact that he has now had two death scenes and is probably returning is dumb and repetitive.The recycled Quaritch drama inadvertently caused the aforementioned final act of the film to be a bit boring despite its high-budget action. We've seen this all before, but it's still cooler because of the inclusion of the Tulkun in the battles and the family aspect raises the stakes.The whalers do introduce a plot hole with when Amrita would've been discovered and brought back to earth, and it just seems weird they replaced the now unmentioned unobtanium. Between the plot holes and unanswered questions, it's clear this movie focused more on spectacle and reintroducing Pandora for the upcoming sequels.Frankly, I think James Cameron's confidence in making this a franchise resulted in a thin plot for this as a stand-alone movie, even though it still improves upon the first in every way. Despite how slapped together the script is, I can't stress enough how much I enjoyed the beautiful first two hours. The story is secondary to the amazing world James keeps expanding and the movie still has beautiful themes.It's a classic case of ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it."" I can't recommend the film enough just for the pure beauty of it, but I have little confidence this will continue to work with the upcoming sequels set to release 2 years apart rather than 13."
Brought the family to watch it and we all enjoyed it. Can always tell an entertaining movie when we all talked about it afterwards on the ride home with no down points about it. It's a beautiful movie and really doubled down on family bonds which was a breath of fresh air. After the disappointment we had with black Panther 2 we were all worried about the runtime and horrible story telling but it was just perfect amount of both. Every moment was justified and was building up a new future to look forward to in the world of Pandora. Even with the long runtime we all are ok with going to imax to watch it again but this time in 3-d (tickets were sold out). Keep them coming we are on board with this style and art of entertainment.
"Many years following the events of the first Avatar film, Jake Sully has built quite the life for him and his family, but when a familiar threat returns to Pandora they must take refuge with a different clan.I watched the first Avatar film for the first time last weekend and I thought it was good. I felt that visually it was incredible but from a script perspective it was ok. So my only real hope for this film was that it gave me a great theatre experience with a more organized and thought out script. Did it do that, let's see.First and foremost James Cameron is the man when it comes to visually pleasing audiences. Every single shot of this film is extremely well crafted and is probably the most visually pleasing film I've ever watched on a big screen. The underwater shots in particular were phenomenal. I had a hard time telling what was CGI and what was not, which is just another testament to Cameron as a director.The action sequences looked incredible and I couldn't help myself from comparing the action in this film and the action in the latest Black Panther. Both have major action scenes on and in water as well as a whole lot of blue people. The difference here though is that the action in this film is substantially better than in Black Panther. They used every aspect of the environment and created some epic action scenes.The other thing James Cameron excels at is immersing you into this world of Pandora. All the different elements that he showcases with his incredible cinematography are mesmerizing, he makes you feel like you're in the movie.From a writing and storytelling perspective I thought it was much improved from the original. The story focuses a lot on Jakes kids, which are all very compelling characters and the development was great to see. Jake and Neytiri take a little bit of a back seat, Neytiri far more so than Jake but I was intrigued enough by the kids that it didn't bother me. That's not to say we don't get some great moments from Jake as he has to balance life as a father as well as a leader. The antagonist was handled far better this time around, he was actually given some development outside of the regular ""kill them all"" mentality from the first.I did feel there were a couple of under developed storylines that seem to have been important when they were introduced but by the end of the film didn't seem to have that big of an impact. Obviously this is spoiler free so I can't share what those subplots are but I think viewers will notice them. My other issue with the story is once the film is done there didn't seem to really be a resolution. We get this big conflict and that specific conflict does end but what the movie was setting up was not resolved. It felt like a midseason finale more so than the end of a film.Overall Avatar: The Way of Water was an improvement upon the original. With James Cameron providing a phenomenal theatrical experience and a better written story fans of the first should be excited to watch this on the biggest screen they can find.8/10."
"Ok heads up, this is a biased review, because I love avatar. The first movie is one of my favourites.I really really liked this film.Quaritch was incredible. Probs my favourite part of the movie was his brilliant villainous portrayal. But blue 😂
Next. This movie is stunning. That's it. That's all I have to say about the visuals. But definitely go see in cinemas.I feel like the movie was mainly about jakes children, making great character development. But I wanted more jake and neytiri.The first act felt a bit slow but brought us back into this beautiful world well with a good back story.The subtle details on each avatar and in the world is another perfect addition. Such as the physical advantages and disadvantages between different biome avatars. But the final act oh my... is great !Now to be critical (although I don't have much bad to say about this film):
There were some plot holes which didn't make sense and were skipped over. Some annoying characters and unoriginal scenes but Yh. Not much.Brilliant film.9/10."
"Avatar: The Way of Water is a stunning visual experience that is a must-watch for families. The 3D technology used in the film truly immerses the viewer in the fantastical world of Pandora, making it feel as though you are right there alongside the characters. The vibrant and lush landscapes are breathtaking, and the attention to detail in the creatures and flora of Pandora is truly impressive. The action sequences are exhilarating and the story is engaging, making for a truly unforgettable experience. Overall, Avatar 2 is a movie that should not be missed, especially in 3D. This is a must watch."
"I don't often write reviews, but such is my disappointment, I sort of have to do it.I really enjoyed the first one. Yes, Avatar was light on story, but it looked awesome. This new movie is tremendous technically sure, but the story is weak, with opportunity of investment in the characters too low. There seemed to be a lot of 'stuff' happening with no real connection to one another, and all the swimming about got a little boring after a while. It's like they got carried away with what they could do under water, and wanted to do more of it for more of it sake. It's been a while since I wanted a movie to end so much, a very looong 3 hours that I thought was going to be immense. In the end, I still didn't know what one was Kate Winslet."
"It would have been nine stars if it wouldn't be for the two super annoying characters of Spider and Tuc in it. These are mostly responsible for the somewhat pathetic and over the top ending. The movie could have been a liiiiiittle shorter, let's say 20 minutes, and that would have made it a total masterpiece! Nevertheless it is of course highly entertaining and visually powerful like nothing else you have ever seen. If you have the chance watch it in 3D. It is visually stunning, it absolutely is. The underwater scenes put you into another world and another level of cinematography. Good to have such a blockbuster back in the theaters after the pandemic...!"
"This movie, about Jake Sully who lives with his newfound family formed on the extrasolar moon Pandora, is a phenomenal sequel to Avatar (2009). It was not as fast-paced as Avatar, but more of a pleasant exploration of a new world - the way of water.The story is simple, but yet appealing because of the incredible universe. We met a lot of new characters, which are often a risk to a movie sequel, but it definitely worked in this one. It was great with something fresh - that we got to explore the world of seas with incredible life and spirits, like in the forests in the first movie. The seas surprised a lot! You just want to dive deep into the water, and hold your breath as long as possible to explore the smallest details in every corner.Many of the new characters were Jake and Neytiri's children, and they were great additions to this sequel. They were very similar to each other, but they did also have different mindsets. At first, I thought the children were gonna be too much for the story, but they nicely developed throughout the movie, and I got really excited about them. Lo'ak was the main character of the children, and he had an important impact on the story, but in the second part of the movie I got very interested in the story of Kiri. She was kind of different, but in a surprising way. She had a special relationship with Eywa, and I loved the interaction between them. Powerful and beautiful!The visuals are the best visuals I have ever seen in a movie. Even though Avatar was incredible in 2009, I'm glad Avatar: The Way of Water had even more improvements, as expected in 2022. It looked gorgeous from start to finish!After the death of the composer James Horner, I was a little worried of if the music was going to be not very Avatar-like, but composer Simon Franglen did a great work!I liked almost everything about this movie, and the visuals of this beautiful universe made me forget the small, negative things. The story developed in a good way throughout the 3 hours and 12 minutes, and there were several scenes that I think were extra impactful, like the explorations in general, Neteyam's death, Neytiri's instinctive reaction after Neteyam's death, Kiri's interaction with Eywa, and Jake and Neytiri's flashbacks of Neteyam. Perfect scenes!To conclude, this movie contains of beautiful explorations of a new world were family matters the most. The technical aspects are greater than ever before, and it can affect any audience. A masterpiece among the world of movies!"
"The story was a perfect example of zero creativity. It was pretty much a recycled version of the first movie. Even the same villain. With no expectations whatsoever I was so excited to watch it, and it end up being a huge disappointment. The story is confusing and poor. So in the first movie humans come to Pandora because of unobtainium and now there's a new whale juice and it's a completely different reason? Also they were weirdly focused in killing Jake.I'm giving it a 3 because visually, the movie is amazing and you can just watch it without sound and probably it will be a better experience."
"Visually beautiful as expected... beyond that, story was surprisingly bland, sadly. Just zero emotional enterprise to the WHOLE 3 hours. Huge letdown for storyline IMO. Not sure how no one didn't impress upon James Cameron that the story was vapid and simple, merely extending it 3 hours was for visuals over story. Why?For such the cost permitted, allocated and implied, the story should f course leaves open at Tory still untold. It appears there's a paired investment into revealing more 'environments' in the upcoming films, but JC needs to rediscover the empathy, pain and flavor of excitement that one over the world with the first one. This just didn't deliver..."
People that saw this movie expecting an extremely complex story with deep characters clearly missed the point of the avatar franchise. I enjoyed both avatar movies because of their simple but emotionally effective stories with jaw dropping visuals. And that's ok. It's good to have a movie where you can just be immersed in the world and in awe of the visuals. It's relaxing to see how incredible the water looks on a big screen. This is the type of movie where the cinema experience transcends just sitting in a chair and staring at a screen. Way of water lets the audience get lost in it's world for three hours straight. Pure escapism. I wouldn't want it any other way.
"Avatar The Way of Water is the long-awaited sequel to Avatar (2009), 13 years in the making. For a long time, I thought this movie would never come out since it's been delayed so many times. Now that it has, I can definitely say it's a sequel to Avatar in the sense that it's more of the same from before. That's not necessarily a bad thing depending on your opinion of the original. If you're someone who liked or loved the first Avatar, you'll really enjoy Way of Water. Even people who just thought Avatar was okay I would say give this a chance, because in many ways it's an improvement over the first. However, many of the issue with that film are present here. If you're someone who really didn't like Avatar then you shouldn't bother with this, as this won't change your mind.Now, I'm someone who's a big fan of James Cameron's early work. The Terminator is great. Terminator 2 and Aliens are among my favorite movies of all time. I enjoy True Lies. The Abyss is okay. Those films prove that Cameron can write a great script and memorable characters if he wants to. Then we get to Titanic, which is a mixed bag for me. I enjoy the second half when the ship is sinking. However, the first half I find to be pretty slow, and I've seen better romances. The original Avatar is a movie I did not like at first. I never got into the immense hype the film had when it came out.After watching it again recently, I can say it's definitely not a bad movie. I had more fun with it than I thought I would. It's a mediocre film elevated my amazing visuals. I still think the film was overhyped and did not deserve to be the highest grossing film ever. But this was when Cameron clearly stopped caring about storytelling as much, and focused everything on the visuals, which is a shame. This film follows suit on that for the most part.The effects are still stunning, even more so than the original. What this film does better than the first is that it barely focused on the humans. Avatar gave half the focus to the Navi and half the focus on the human side, whilst Way of Water focuses primarily on Jake and his family on the Navi side. So, we get more exploration of Pandora in this one. I imagine someone who really got into the visuals and worldbuilding of the first film will probably enjoy this one even more. The action scenes are also impressive, as expected from a Cameron film.I will even say the characters are improved in this film, if only slightly. Aside from Neytiri, there was no one I really cared about in the original that much. Here I actually like Jake. I got into his character arc of him being a soldier coming into conflict with him no being a father trying to keep his family safe. Even the main villain is more fun to watch in this. He as a bit of depth to him here, rather than just being a one note villain. It's not much, but it's at least something.The biggest issues from the original have not gone away though. The film is extremely long. It's significantly longer than the first, which is already bloated. For such a simple story, there is no reason for the film to be as long as it is. I felt the length in places, particularly the third act. The final battle, while well-executed, does drag on too long. It's every bit as preachy and heavy-handed as the first.It's the same story of Navi versus humans. I would have preferred there be no humans at all in this. I would have liked a movie where it's just Jake and his family exploring Pandora. The main threat should have been a rival tribe or a natural disaster. Nature can be just as destructive as humanity. The humans could have made a return in the third film. That's just me though. As it is, it's still enjoyable enough, as the humans are less of a focus in this.Overall, like I said, if you go into the first Avatar then there's no reason not to check this out if you haven't already. I will say it is better than the first, despite being more bloated. I'd give the first film a 6 out of 10. This one I'd give a 6.5, rounded up to 7 for IMDB. I just hope that Cameron can channel his old self and make a great story, as well as a visual spectacle, in the inevitable third movie. I'm pretty sure Avatar 3 will happen even if this film doesn't do well, since Cameron supposedly filmed Avatar 2 & 3 (and possibly Avatar 4) all back-to-back."
"I love James Cameron and he always has a wonderful cast both in front of and behind the scenes. He works with the very best. You'll love the sci fi tech and stunning visuals in this movie. The world building is exceptional.That said, we saw this script before. Same bad military jarhead guys doing the same bad things to haunt and torture the peaceful natives. This story needs to be told, because militaries and resource hungry countries have always invaded relatively defenseless countries under the guise of saving or helping them, only to steal their resources. But this retelling is almost exactly the same as the last avatar, down to the same bad guy. And the story tellers beat you over the head repeatedly with the family dynamic. So the writing was really lazy and it shows. And the way it ended, I am expecting more of the same from avatar 3.They need new writers with a new dynamic story. Sorry James. It's technologically beautiful but intellectually lame. Go anyway, but don't expect anything different from Avatar 1."
"AVATAR : THE WAY OF WATER ..... Wow what a visual treat for the eyes this film is amazing too look at even more spectacular then the first film , the colours the depth the 3D are all AMAZING and i absolutely loved the fist two hours ....!! But then if i'm being completely honest i had had enough and looked at my watch and realised we had over an hour left of the film and i thought to myself wowsers this film is too long and couldn't wait for it too finish ....!! I was thinking towards the end that it is not even going to end because there are more film to come in the next few years .... saying that i did like the film but can only score it 7/10 because it looks amazing but was far too long i just hope the next films are not as long as it could put me off watching them ....!!!!"
"One word review, spectacular. Everything in the film is eye catching, the visuals and the direction is one of the best thing to watch this movie.The story is little bit slow but still it keeps you riveted throughout the movie and till the end. You connect with characters on emotional level and feel their pain as well as joy.The level of efforts have been taken to make this one is clearly visible with the visuals especially those under and above the water scenes those are just unmatchable. James has proved he is a Alchemist of the Cinema in thw whole world. Nobody can match his level of imagination and visual story telling. This is the best one."
"Incredible experience. I know it is very long, and overstuffed, but even being overlong and overstuffed, this is still an incredible experience. If you can't sit through long films then simply don't watch it.The storyline is still fresh, and follows up the story of Pandora, the Na'vi and the avatars in inventive and fresh ways. The storyline is a little flat, but this is a film that is more about watching for the visual experience rather than the storyline.Incredible, emotional, innovative, groundbreaking, should win multiple Oscars... This is a must-see for anybody who is able to sit through long works of cinema."
"When even the characters get self-aware during the plot. All in all beautiful visuals, but at the end of the plot there was still so. Much. Movie. Left. Would have loved to be a fly on that writer's room wall when they pitched the idea of a 190! Minute special-effects wet dream with the same plot-lines on repeat. And sometime during the last 10 years someone threw a ""HOW ABOUT HE BECOMES BESTIES WITH A WHALE WHO IS BULLIED BY THE OTHERS"" into the mix.3 hours of water, explosions, and a little bit of motion sickness due to the IMAX experience.In the end the plot-holes hint towards a potential third part to the Avatar series. Can't wait to see which memory stick they are going to use this time to resurrect the ""bad guy"". Apparently they have a whole bunch of them lying around.Don't hold your breath for this one. Literally."
"Personally I loved it, it was long, but only realised this once I left the cinema and looked at my watch and checking that my individual avatar tee shirt did indeed glow under ultra violet light - but I digress. The story does pick up just after where the original left off and you see Jakes family grow in a short series of historical time line. Then Mr. Bad guy rears his ugly head again, hell bent on killing Jake (but the twist is he is now an avatar). Anyway.....on the story goes, with the full 4DX experience I was there, every explosion with flashing lights around the auditorium, puffs of air around your ears as arrows literally fly past, the seats were rocking up and down, I was in that battle. Then fast forward to the sea shots, where you feel the flow of the water, the light spray on your face as one of the characters encounters a sort of whale (where in another little story emerges). Eventually the climax, which If I am totally honest I felt just a teeny weeny bit let down, but realise that there is going to be Avatar 3, 4 , 5 (I hope they don't drag this story out too much as I can see us die hard fans may get impatient). Over all the experience came as a close second to the flight of passage ride in Animal Kingdom Orlando, and the story line I felt was perfect, I cried, I squealed, I laughed - exactly what I would want from a movie."
"I really don't know what to feel about this one. All of the hype and the expectations surrounding this long awaited sequel to the highest grossing film ever only served to doom this film. So I'm sympathetic but also the substance of the film is still lacking.James Cameron almost has a reputation for making great movies now. So the myth of James Cameron and the lofty expectations and planned sequels all cloud your perception of this film and I think it is incredibly unfair. This isn't a bad movie and I know the think pieces and studios will consider it a failure if it doesn't get top 10 highest grossing films in history. From what I have seen though the critics and audience receptions aren't as harsh as I expect the decision makers will be.To my opinion of the film, I will start with what I don't like. I watched this in 3D because I'm stupid. The 3D makes everything look worse but I researched the first one when it was rereleased in 3D so I wanted to compare. It certainly looks better here but that is kind of a low bar. I absolutely hate 3D and this film is no different. It makes everything look worse than normal cinematography. I have no doubt that I would like the look of this film had I not watched in 3D. It felt so much like a video game, everything felt fake and that is including the scenes consisting entirely of humans (though they are in a green screen room).Also nothing Jake Sully does makes any sense and it felt like James Cameron just wanted to take the world to the water, a place on Earth that he is amazed by (understandably so). Also the Na'vi don't really make logical decisions either.An aspect that I like is how it didn't go into white savior mode as much as it did in the first film. The world is cool and the spirituality and commentary on imperialism and environmental destruction are decent and interesting (if you don't pay attention to how anything works).I like that James Cameron has taken his expertise and tried to produce stories that make a positive impact on the world. I don't think he has a firm understanding of the things he portrays but he isn't by any means being disrespectful (at least not intentionally anymore).Overall it's a decent film and some day I hope to watch it in regular old 4k or even HD. So maybe I can enjoy the beauty while trying to ignore the illogical nonsense."
"A sequel to the most commercially successful movie of all time, and this one's even more epic and beautiful. This guy knows how to make movies for the big screen. He's the master of commercial cinema. And Avatar 2 is just another testimony of his greatness.One of the most beautiful films you'll ever get to watch on the big screen. Filled with jaw dropping visuals. It's a visual masterpiece. I was in absolute awe of every scene in the seas. It's hard to believe that everything here has been created by CGI.Avatar 2, in typical Cameron style, overtakes its predecessor in terms of visuals, plot, and characters. The writing is not that great, but still an improvement over the original. Felt more connected with the characters, whereas in the first film, I didn't care about a single character. Even though we don't see any of the actors on screen, the whole cast really did a good job, especially Zoe Saldana. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous. Cameron's storytelling doesn't let the 3 hour runtime feel like a drag, even with a mediocre plot. In fact, a lot of the scenes that doesn't hold much importance, were my favourite scenes because of how gorgeous it looked. I wouldn't have minded if he made a 3 hour film with only those underwater scenes.Avatar 2 is a cinematic experience that will stay with me for a long time."
"Avatar is a unique film, in that it is, in fact, the highest grossing film of all time, but nothing since has really come of it, other than a land at Disney World. James Cameron has not directed any movies since. Way of Water therefore is a sequel 13 years in the making, originally planned for a 2013 release. The result is a film that is ""more"" than the original. It's more beautiful than ever before, there's more and better action, but the story and characters are more bland than in the first.In terms of visual effects, they were as perfect as one could ever ask for. Cameron, perhaps more than any other director, knows how to put on a visual spectacle. With the likes Terminator 2 and Titanic under his belt, he really is the king of visual effects. Avatar: The Way of Water is quite possibly the most impressive visual spectacle in the history of cinema. Everything about Pandora is stunningly beautiful. The familiar ecosystems of the forest and the floating mountains are great, but the reef is mindblowing. No underwater scene ever has come close to the sheer radiance of the Metakayina home. (Cameron really loves water, doesn't he?) The brilliant colors, creatively designed creatures, and each and every little life form make the world of Pandora feel so alive. Seeing this movie in IMAX 3D is quite possibly the best experience I've ever had in a theater. It's hypnotic. In 3D, you don't see Pandora. Pandora comes to you. The action scenes, of which there are much more than before, are also great. The big epic battle is upgraded from the first, with some new ways of fighting added in. Not saying anything about that for spoilers.One interesting aspect of the visuals is the frame rate, which has sequences run at 48 frames per second (most movies are 24). While it may not sound like anything special, it really is. It's difficult to describe, but it's very noticeable. The results of this are mixed. It looks jarring to a certain extent when it's humans on screen, but it flows fluidly when it's scenes with the Na'vi. When it flows well, it really adds to the effect. While Way of Water is not the first film to attempt this, it mostly works, adding another technical feat to Cameron's portfolio. However, not the entire film is 48 fps. This results in some noticeable frame drops, which is not something I ever anticipated saying about a movie. Usually that terminology is reserved for video games.The story is meh, at best. Avatar should really move on from the entire ""humans versus Na'vi"" aspect. In the first movie, the humans are like a window for us viewers, as Earth dwelling humans, to enter the world of the Na'vi. We don't need that anymore. Taking the humans out of the movie will open the door to explore the world of Pandoran culture much better. But instead, Earth and Pandora are still at war, and Colonel Quaritch from the first movie returns as a Na'vi. It is an interesting dynamic that he hates the Na'vi but yet becomes one, which is something that the story does right. And him coming back is dumb to us, but at least it makes sense when it's explained. The dialogue is also an issue, it's really bad. It is disappointing for the story to underwhelm, especially given what we know James Cameron is capable of.The other characters, both old and new, aren't really much to report on. Jake is a strong family patriarch now, which is a natural progression from where he's from. Neytiri really hasn't changed any since the first film, but she's still the same agile fighter that she was before. Spider, a human who wants to be a Na'vi, is a new character that's conceptually interesting, but nothing noteworthy in execution. Neteyam and Lo'ak are a typical big brother little brother duo. Not really much to say. Kiri is an interesting character, but her voice was really weird, because she's canonically 14 years old and being played by a 73-year old actress.And yet, when it focuses on the Na'vi and Eywa, there's a certain comfort in the simplicity of the story and characters. Avatar is not a film in which to be invested in deep lore like Lord of the Rings or even Marvel, but rather a different type of immersion. There are no volumes of Avatar lore, what you see is what there is. There's a certain mysticism to it. The character of Kiri is like the audience that way. She is connected through the water to Eywa, but cannot really explain why. She can feel Ewya's heart, which the audience can too, somehow. And it is indeed mighty. This is the beauty of Avatar; we can connect to its fictional world on an emotional and even spiritual level. This is something that can be said of very few movies."
"The plot is very standard American. Guns, violence, American culture, calling your dad 'sir', etc. But it's an American movie så fine. But I still feel like the plot were as basic as it could have been. Felt like they just picked stuff from every other worlds end movie.But it's a very beautiful movie and it should totally be watched for the first time at the cinema. I love the facial expression of the characters, I love the water effects, love the wet effect in the enviroment. Absolutley adored that we meet other ""Avatars"" and how they approach eachother.I can't give it a higher rating because of the half assed plot. But I can't give it less since it really is a watch worthy movie."
"The special effects are good. There is a decent story there. But, when you get down to it, it is little more than a war movie with interminable firefights. Also, some of the typical cinematic techniques, like switching quickly from ""scene to scene"", don't work well with 3D. The backgrounds on 3D are very blurry (to create the depth of field) but by the time your eye finds the main focus point, the film has moved on - leaving the feeling of ""what was that?"". The movie obviously attempt to appeal to virtually everyone - those looking for something ""morally uplifting"" and those wanting a good action flick. I'm guessing it went on so long partly because of that and partly because they spent so much money on the special effects that they could not bear not to use them. They made a movie with much potential quite boring. I think I'll skip the obviously forthcoming sequel."
"As we all know about James Cameron is such a versatile director, AVATAR (2009) not only show us what cgi and vfx can do but also what nature means to us. You can say the story was awesome and visual effects were so cool but for me I saw it like james wants to show us the importance of nature in our lives. And in AVATAR 2 (2022) he showed us the new world that lies in the ocean and the harsh reality of Human Beings, as we are hunting innocent animals for food and benefit, we are the real monster here. This is what I like the most about both the movies, you can't argue about the visuals and cinematography. James is a gem, people can say it is a long or sometimes a stretch but it is what it is I like you must see this in a theatre it is a life time experience. I loved the movie, got my exams still managed to watch this gem. Love YOU JAMES:)
AVATAR <3."
"The Way of Water comes out after 13 years
to represent significant advancements in the possibilities of special effects, which is just stunning and i just had to write a review as i just came home after seeing it on the big screen.Immersive storytelling, although not ground-breaking, with a message of the meaning of family and the portrayal of a strong father and mother protecting their children combined with amazing 3D effects, that it sometimes feels like you're sitting next to the characters and feel them, which this time add more depth to the story as some might think.As sequel it amazes again with every shot beautifully in perfect CGI but also PG rated as some younger children definitely should wait as this time it is more action and violent packed.Big emotions are just as apparent throughout the movie with Cameron's passionate storytelling pulling on our heartstrings and every scene feels just right from the beginning to the end. The movie could go on for another 30 minutes and still wouldn't be boring in any way.The second movie with the new characters, new tribes and animals surprised me, as it was way better than expected and feels much more evolved than the first movie, which was almost great.This time was stunning
probably until the next movie when Cameron will revolutionize and top it again (!?).For those who would like to escape again to the wonderful world of pandora and also any other movie lovers, it has to be seen, and not from the comfort of your couch or on your phone in the airplane, but on the biggest * screen you can find!(* IMAX recommended - as you get 25% more screen)"
"I saw the movie in REAL 3D, and that is perhaps the minimum one should see the movie presented. The 3D adds so much to the movie, and most of it is subtle. The sky people return to Pandora, with a vengeance. And target #1 is Sully and his family. The sky people have learned a lot since they were forced to leave, and they bring with them a twist. Since the presence of his family is most important, Sully flees to hide with the sea people. So the movie becomes a story of family and acceptance of a different culture, as Sully represents the forest people. One is introduced to a whole new world on Pandora, that of the ocean. And this is done visually stunning. There is a cultural tension. Yes, the movie is very long, but it really doesn't drag and the heavy action is towards the end. This is a movie that really has to be seen on a big screen, and the bigger the better. The special effects are in service to the story, not the other way around."
"Took my young grandchildren to see this at the movies which was a risk being such a long movie, but they sat there glued to the screen the whole time.I also found it enjoyable.My only knock was dragging out the ending a bit much.The visuals were stunning, even more so than the first one.Story touches on many issues which would normally draw 'woke' comments for some parts but they did it in a way that such comment is not applicable.Hard to judge the acting being avatars and not humans. Although it's more an experience movie than an academy award winning masterpiece (which aren't usually done these days for the general public to enjoy)If it's still screening go see it as it won't be the same on a TV."
"I loved Avatar. And I liked this one. Which sucks because I wanted to love this one too!I mean it's all there: everything we loved about the first, except that's just the problem.It's EVERYTHING we loved. The conflict the character arch for the younger cast members. It's plays very close to the first.And what it does change is great and fun and new, but sadly when the credits roll I was left feeling like I just watched a 3 hour preview for Avatar three, four and five.The movie doesn't take itself too seriously which is nice, even mocking itself once which made things better in my opinion (you'll know what part when you see it)In total, decent film, but probably won't be seeing it as many times as I did the first one."
"There are few movies that 'wow' you in your lifetime. When you come out of the cinema you feel like you've come out of a different place. It can be due to both how visually engrossing the movie is or because of a great screenplay and characterization. Avatar The Way of Water definitely falls in the first category (goes without saying) and how. I think I can definitely say that this is the BEST visual experience I have had in a theatre.I had my reservations about this movie when I saw the trailer. The trailer didn't feel much different than the previous film and also considering how so many movies come with high budget visual effects these days as compared to 2009. But when you watch this on an IMAX screen you will realize why the trailer wasn't really impressive because you'd need the visual medium to go with it. This movie felt like I was watching a game and in a very very good way. Back in 2009, Avatar had impressed me visually but I hadn't seen it in IMAX. This time around you'd have to give it to James Cameron's detailed efforts and the movie visually justifies all the research and time he has put it in. The movie starts in Pandora and it immediately takes you back to the familiar world which we had seen 13 years ago. However, the movie goes to a whole new dimension when the world (or should I say way) of water is introduced. The underwater visuals are mind blowing and it is much better than what I thought they would be. A few scenes are beyond a human mind's imagination. The people who walked in late in front of the screen in the theatre post interval with their food and beverages looked underwater, that's how good the visuals and 3D effects are! It is safe to say that James Cameron has started another revolution in the movie making this one.Avatar's (2009) plot wasn't a groundbreaking one but it still was gripping and many characters had a great emotional arc. The Way of Water's plot is pretty simple and straightforward and also continues from where we left off previously. There are many moments where one can easily guess what happens next and also what caused something. The set up for the sequel is pretty obvious as well, unlike the first one. This movie finds it very difficult to establish an emotional connection between its characters and the audience. There are way too many characters (especially teens and kids) and some are written for a very obvious role. Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana almost kinda play the supporting roles here and I really missed their chemistry which was seen in the first movie. Stephen Lang and Sigourney Weaver are back again (you'll know why) but this time their characters don't really make the impact as much as the previous one. I would have definitely loved to see some changes especially with respect to those two characters. Apart from that there are many supporting characters and some usual suspects who try to bring the humour and the classic 'human' overconfidence. There are some great goosebump moments in some frames, however the same cannot be said with respect to the action sequences. Some of the new animals introduced this time probably connected with me better than the speaking characters :P Although the background score is pretty good, I feel there was some room for the element of surprise. I wish there was one classic theme associated with the movie like how the Terminator, Star Wars and Indiana Jones are remembered. However, all these shortcomings don't affect your viewing experience in any way.Avatar: The Way of Water is groundbreaking (literally and figuratively) in many ways for a modern day cinema where every other movie comes with top notch visual effects. Unfortunately a lot of experience is dependent on one watching it in IMAX 3D. I believe that it wouldn't be the same if one watches in 2D or at any average 3D screen. So I'd recommend you to wait for the chance to get to see this on an IMAX screen in case you don't have easy access to one."
"James Cameroon pulls no punches when it comes to creating movies with niche technology. I was very pleased to watch it in Dolby Vision 3D with 60fps (yep 60 not 24) and the motion picture was so crisp and sharp with true HDR color, and the sound system screamed in my ears beautifully making sure that feel every beat.The story is engaging from start to finish. The music is captivating. It will be a real shame to watch it in normal theaters.James did it again. I would recommend this movie to everyone from age 13 and above 👍Watch part one if you don't remember the story. Can't wait to see the upcoming sequels."
"One of the most awaited film of the past decade and boy does it live up to expectations! The visuals are INSANE! There is no shred of doubt that a masterpiece has been created. Is it a flawless film? By no means. The writing as cliche as the first film, but it still manages to engage and keep you hooked right till the end. There's a point in the film in the first third where the protagonist makes a questionable decision to move his family that makes no sense. But if you let that slide, there's a plethora of action sequences and heart wrenching drama awaiting.The CGI, the performance capture, the cinematography and all the detail over and under the water is just impeccable. There is not one pixel that has been left neglected. I forgot within seconds that most of what I was watching was computer generated and the whole deal seems plausible just like watching a nature documentary. Especially watching the film in 3D on a Dolby screen is extremely immersive. I found myself holding my breath whenever the action went underwater. And what marvelous action it is! And I'm not just talking about the fight sequences. Every time the characters go underwater it feels like an adventure that kept me on the edge of my seat. The score has been bettered from the first film by Simon Franglen. It still uses some of the motifs from the first film but felt more engaging. The editing was a bit off on two occassions when ""Tsireya"" played by Bailey Bass speaks which was really weird and it made me question whether there was some censorship involved. The bluray release will tell.Overall I really loved the movie and will try to catch it a few more times while it's still running on the big screen."
"Which doesn't say much since I expected more from it, but at least it's a pretty fine movie if you want to spend some quality time in this holiday season with your loved ones and has nothing else to do better than laying around and scrolling through your social media feeds in your home, cause that's what this movie is all about: family, without having the need to autistically tell it to the audience like Dominic Toretto always does every single time he's on screen. CGI's pretty hollywood standard to me, nothing special, the messaging is simple, not to politically lean to either side of the spectrum, draggy at some parts, dialog's okay, the interactions and the dynamics between the characters sometimes felt too rushed despite this movie being more than 3-hour long. It's pretty clear from the ending and the mystery box Cameron put in this movie that there will be a third movie, though I'm not pretty excited for that (dunno, hollywood fatigue maybe?) and I think the first movie is still better in delivering the story and the worldbuilding aspect, this one overall feels like Cameron needs to tell you what happens after the first movie without so much expansion on his Avatar-verse."
"This review relates to the 3D versionAVATAR: THE WAY OF WATER is the long-awaited sequel to James Cameron's sci-fi classic, Avatar (2009). This time around we follow the Sully family - Jake, Neytiri and their kids - as they face several challenges to remain safe. Set more than a decade after the original film, this instalment brings 3D entertainment to the next level.The narrative follows the Sully family as they navigate a world of danger and uncertainty. We witness their battles to stay alive, their lengths to protect one another and the tragedies that befall them. All these elements are intertwined in an amazingly crafted 3D adventure.The narrative of THE WAY OF WATER is a prime example of how 3D can be used to create a detailed, captivating story even though the narrative is nothing out of the ordinary. The visuals are stunning, the action sequences nail-biting and the characters are easy to relate to. Plus, the use of CGI enhances the visual spectacle even more.The acting performances in THE WAY OF WATER are also noteworthy. Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) delivers an emotionally charged performance as the head of the family, while Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña) and their children are equally impressive. The acting is even more impressive when you realise that the scenes shot underwater were actually done underwater with innovative new techniques and technology developed for something never done before! James Cameron has excelled once again with his directing and the entire crew has done a tremendous job in bringing this ambitious project to life.There is a plethora of themes explored throughout such as family, courage, and determination. The issues around colonisation and environmentalism also feature although avoiding the preachy clichés of some other sci-fi films.Although AVATAR: THE WAY OF WATER is a little too long (over 3 hours!) and drags slightly in a couple of places, it is a splendid example of how 3D can be used to craft an unforgettable story that draws viewers in. It's gripping, visually stunning and emotionally engaging with captivating storytelling and performances - making it a must-see for fans and newcomers alike. Highly recommended! And make sure you see it on the biggest possible screen in 3D if you can!"
"Not sure what happened with this movie. In the first avatar, we follow Jake Sully as he learns to appreciate and come to love an alien nation on a human occupied planet. He fights for what's right and to protect his new family, friends and lover. He never backs down. He fails but keeps trying, never giving up and eventually becomes the clans most honorably fighter and leader through his courage and daring to fight for what is right.In this movie, we see Jake Sully become a father, both biologically and adoptive. He also forfeits his membership with the clan to flee. Yes, flee from a fight. His clan had hoarded many wins and human weapons, explosives and aircraft with his leadership, but when the colonel from the first movie returns as an avatar, he runs. He doesn't run to somewhere stronger and more defensible. He flees to a clan without aircraft, guns and explosives. He character arch has degraded to nothing more than a begger seeking refuge. He claims its to protect the clan, but he drags his family with, keeping them in danger, and now endangers a hesitant new clan of strangers who offer to take him and his family in so long as his promise they won't be hunted and followed is true and that his family adapts to their unique life.None of that happened. He ends up being found because an ally aircraft comes to render medical aid (which didn't help nor was needed) and they left the gps on and was tracked. Sure. Jakes children and adopted daughter adapt to the new clans ways, but sully... he was barely able to hold his breath during the climatic fight and escape at the end. So, what did he do this whole time his kids were learning to swim and hold their breath for copious amounts of time? Nothing but mope, sniveling and begging for forgiveness. His alpha male leader and fighter role from the first movie is gone. He is now a begger and refugee. A hippy.Now let's touch some very gaping plot holes. Like how the military career focused colonel had a baby at some unknown point during the first movie. On a planet he himself said was the most hostile place to be. A baby. Yup. Makes sense. I feel forced plot though, and now we have spider. Also, at some point during the first movie, he copied his brain onto a hard drive and sent it back to earth so he could return as an avatar. Forced plot. He died. Cameron couldn't come up with a new villan? Further more, we also have Grace. Her avatar apparently had a child. Which leads to she either got frisky in her avatar body at some point, or most likely what I sense is coming, a Jesus style birth. Not conceiving, but a pregnancy created by eywa. This was never clarified. But hinted that her and Norm may have hooked up? I hope not, because the deleted scenes showed Norm and Trudy were intimate. But like I said, I forsee a Jesus thing happening, and given Grace's offspring has a very odd relationship with things plants and living creatures of pandora, even focusing eywa to an extent, seems more evidence that she is the Navi Jesus born of eywa.And lastly. We have forgotten the shiny rock the humans were there to collect. We're now hunting whales for a bottle of goo that makes humans stop aging. Thats out of the blue, pun intended.The whole movie seemed focused on ruining existing character development, forcing the plot, and oooo LOOK! Cgi everywhere, look what we can do with computers! 13 years we waited for a sequel, and this was what we got. How disappointing."
"James Cameron has done it again. Avatar: The Way of Water is a visually stunning adventure that you have to see on the biggest screen possible because the visuals are spellbinding and you get totally immersed in Pandora. Surprisingly, it's not just the spectacle, there's plenty of emotion in here and I cried twice. And oh my the world building, the alien creatures in the ocean he has created are nothing short of extraordinary, and jaw dropping to look at. Coming to it's main weakness, which is the storyline- It's an extremely simple story which is mostly a typical good guy vs bad guy...could have had some more depth. Especially on rewatching the first movie I feel that one had a better storyline. Hopefully avatar 3 can combine great visuals with a great story which would make it a masterpiece."
"I knew what I was getting into watching this movie. First avatar was transformative. I didn't watch it in theatre. So when watching on small screen it didn't justify the movie.Avatar 2 is an experience worthy of theatre. Every shot is framed beautifully. There is a big emphasis on family. Since last avatar, there has 13 year gap. Naturally there was a need to introduce entire new generation of characters to keep the franchise going. There are 2 strong characters from new generation.But you don't go to avatar for story. You want epic worldbuilding and escape into fantasy. Avatar 2 world is even better than avatar 1. Do watch it even if it costs an arm and a leg."
"Wasn't expecting much, apart from some blue people running around in gorgeous graphics. What I got was a pretty engaging story about a family finding its way in the world. It did take me into a new world and the underwater scenes were very convincing, had me thinking about my attempts at diving, I was subconsciously holding my breath at times. For a 12a it did seem a bit graphic, with lots of killing which did become a little tiresome for me as an adult. I much preferred the interactions with nature and tended to switch off when the shooting started. Some characters seem to add nothing, spider was one example. A long movie, so make sure you are in huge reclining chairs with some drinks."
"Terrible story, built on hate. Very shallow. I was hoping there would be more talent in the writing of this movie but alas, to no avail.it would be wonderful to see them put the time and effort into a story that makes you feel good and walk away with a positive message. When will this lame entertainment industry figure out that people want positive entertainment and not empty rhetoric.I will not continue to go to movies that just have beautiful scenery with no story to sink your teeth into. There are so many better writers out there. Why not look for one with an original plot and positive outlook on life."
"""Avatar 2"" is a great way to experience undersea life while being entertained. The score, acting, cinematography are top notch. Yes, it is 3+ long; Nevertheless, considering it's high quality, I find it to still be enjoyable.The scenes here go into detail on multi-apecies relationships. Characters of various species not only swim, but seem to be able to chat with one another, all shot and acted very realistically. It is amazing to see nature unite!Another thing I find striking about this movie is the fact this was released after being filmed years ago-only to be delayed a few times under various circumstances. This is an example of something standing the test of time. I recall seeing the first movie back over the holidays 2009, and due to my enjoyment of it, I was looking forward to watching this one all these , from what I can recall. Initially learned of sequels in some Scholastics World Records Book. For it to finally be released it's like a party getting something over with as well as someone getting to experience something.My grade: A-"
"The visualization is great, the real physics snd mechanical details are outstanding, but the story has redundant events and aren't connected.This part gets the kids involved and makes it more uncomfortable and unfair battles were expanded . The communication with the audience looks lost after 40 min.Also, the kids involvement in the conflicts and the connection to dangerous environment give sort of stress during the show.The first part has obvious spiritual meaning, like the connection with nature and with the animals, this part doesn't.. it's not worth to spend money and three hours for move you can wait to see after on prime or other medias.."
"Review: the story of Jake and Netyri continues as their five children also join the saga and we see the new Warer Tribe of Pandora! You will love the beautiful Colors and the Water Animals! If the first film was ""Star Wars"" then Avatar The Way of Water is no doubt ""The Empire Strikes Back""Takeaways:-As with The first Avatar...IT MUST BE SEEN IN 3D!! AT LEAST ONCE!!!-Though Jake (Same Worthington) and Netyri (Zoe Saldana) are very much still the lead Characters The Story is now less about Jake and Netyri and more about the Sully family in general.-Jake and Netyri are now parents to three biological Children, Neteyam (James Flatters), Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) and Tukitery (Trinity Jo-li Bliss)-Jake and Netyri are also parents to two adopted ones. One of them Kiri (Sigourney Weaver), was birthed with the DNA of the Late Dr Grace Augustine. Grace was revealed to be pregnant before her death, and basically Kiri was birthed from her. This is finally an explanation as to why Sigourney Weaver is playing her. She is Grace's Daughter.The other child is a human boy named spider (played by Jack Champion)...it turns out (in a brilliant Star Wars-esque twist) that he is the son of a villian: the late Colonel Miles Quarritch (Stephen Lang)Speaking of Quartitch..Stephen Lang does a great job reprising his role..sort of. He plays a Navi clone of the real Quarritich called a recombinant (Recom) and he wants revenge on Jake Sully for his betrayal. 18-ish years ago. He will most likely be the main villain of the upcoming sequels as well.Sadly the Sully's are on the run when the ""Sky People"" have returned to finish what they started Before Jake stopped them the first time: mine Pandora's resources by forcing Navi off of their lands..The Metakayans are the water tribe. Which I love because I love water it is my favorite element and I love the sea creatures (Akulas and Ilus) and blue is my favorite color.-Cliff Curtis (Playing Tonowari) and Kate Winslet (Playing Ronal) are great as the Mettakayan village leaders, who help the sully family Learn the mettakayan way of water.-Of course the real standout of theirs move are THE AMAZING SPECIAL EFFECTS CGI AND BACKGROUND!! We see the Beautiful Water Realm of Pandora Amazingly Beautifully realized!-People say The Story is Thin? I reapectfully disagree. I thought it was fitting for this sequel, and it continues the family tale perfectly.-IMDB scored 7.8? Lesser than Avatar 1? I'm sorry but I must respectfully disagree with that decision. This was more enjoyable than the first.In Conclusion: this briliant Sequel is only the beginning, and hopefully the third movie will be the conclusion of the Nav'i war with the Sky People. Avatar TWOW is better than the first movie and it is only going up from here!"
"This obv had better visuals and a tad bit better narrative but i felt that was mainly coz of the introduction of more than a handful of new characters, creatures and new environment and while Cameron showcased an immersive new Pandora region he also did utilize those newly introduced characters as well as the environment in a well if not in a complete manner and that along with the emotional & familial elements(all worked out well by those compelling & effective performances from the actors involved) of the movie made the narrative a bit better and watchworthy.Cameron's worldbuilding is just class, for me and i appreciated and made somewhat the same statement in my thoughts on the first one but his storytelling's just unoriginal and not at all impressive.It's a different world, it's a different species, it's a whole lotta different culture, yet it all felt always so damn familiar and that's just not something I can praise in any way. To create seems easy for Cameron but to actually make everything he created run to it's maximum potential and in a fresh manner seems almost impossible coz of the dryness in the creative jucie flow involved in the stuffs apart from worldbuilding.It's a bit of a disappointment that coz of this same reason I found myself immersed in just the world of pandora, looking all across the screen throughout at the various different vegitation, the sky, the creatures and characters, the detailing and designing of them and all more than the narrative as even without focusing on it,
it was pretty much easy to come to an exact conclusion to a major or minor plot point, thus a complete nobrainer on the narrative part.I just hope Cameron's not planning to deliver the next 3 sequels having Sully & Quaritch playing the cat and mouse game throughout the various different regions of Pandora while staying with different Na'vi clans.I so much want atleast one of the next sequel to be limited on action sequences and more on an original plot, character development, world exploration at it's finest and such (lol the demands a casual movie watcher makes....smh)I don't think I'd find the rewatch better than i did the first one as idk this was more action oriented I guess than it's predecessor and i think even while being better than it's predecessor it's still somehow didn't impress me any better than the original, except for the visuals part, that is.This was the best 3D movie viewing experience and the only one where I found the Dolby Atmos to be something that I found for the first of the many times I have experienced it, to be actually effective rather than just loud ( made me feel the impact every time chaos occured onscreen as well as made me feel present in the world throughout) and that's what the .5 (6.5 + .5) extra rating is for."
"It is impossible to go into hyperbole when praising this cinematic miracle. It is an unbelievably well executed visual experience bringing together cinematography, CGI and all kinds of technology and expertise invented just to create a reality that is, well, seemingly real. Albeit it should have been impossible for it to exist anywhere but in the imagination.The plot not so much. Hopefully the incredible visual experience will gloss over the couple of gaping plot holes or three.The dialog is simply infantile. That may be a problem unless the audience buys that in Pandora they speak Semper Fi, Inner City Earth Slang and Leave it to Beaver.Do not miss this movie, for the incredible and unbelievably good visual experience."
"To all of you : ""the story is weak! Theres to much visual scenery!""??????KNOW YOU ROLE AND SHUT YOUR MOUTHS JABRONNI!!IM GONNA TAKE YOU DOWN -REAL REVIEW- Boulavard!And Give it to you R-A-W!Who cares about a super detailed storyline with boring dialogue in an ACTION ADEVENTURE FANTASY FILM!!This is better than the first movie!IT starts out fast paced and keeps it steady till the End!There's Death ! Betrayal And Redemption!The Visual Experience is Masterful maybe the greatest EVER!(i saw it in 3D and highly recommend it)Just Go See IT! And Dont let the nit pickers derail you!10/10 in my opinion! Instant Classic!"
"First things first. Yes the visuals are awesome. I think most people will know that about the film and don't need a review to let them know that. Visually it did feel like I was there on Pandora. Although I will say that the 3D.. while technically very good.. just in some ways makes it feel less immersive. I feel like my eyes are being closed off and I can't see around me. Like I have blinders on. Seeing a huge IMAX screen feels more immersive to me.. but I'm getting off track.To me this really felt like a redo of the first movie. I did appreciate the extra work they put in the further develop the relationships and to give the kids some personality. But the story still felt pretty flat, predicable, and tired to me. A mostly re-telling of the story from the first movie. I had hoped for more on the story and script side. I was disappointed there.The actors all seemed to do a good job and they were compelling. I think Zoe Saldana really was better than most of the other actors she was working with.Overall I was disappointed and had expected more from the story and the experience on a personal level. From what I read about all the work they did on the script.. I had hoped it would have done more with it. The reasons that all the fighting was going on.. just didn't seem motivated or make much sense. The movie just wanted action and fighting it seems. Oh well."
"Some female writers would have really helped this dumpster fire of a script. We're really gonna have the female characters constantly ignored by their husbands with little to no consequences? Jake Sully is the most insufferable husband and father. Also, after 12 years they couldn't come up with a new villain? Really?I wish I could've enjoyed the VFX without some character ruining the moment with exposition every 30 seconds.But the visual effects really are stunning, and if you can see beyond the distracting exposition-driven dialogue that treats the audience like they're stupid, then you'll probably like the movie. I couldn't, but if you watch it for the VFX you'll probably like it."
"Yeah it had some decent visuals, at some points absolutely amazing ones, at others, it was so obviously rushed. Mainly when the metkayina are attacked and they all rush off to counter attack, VERY poor CGI in those scenes.The story was an absolute mess.I get that Lang wanted revenge for being killed on his last outing, but ffs that is a really really weak plot point that had zero requirements of being in the movie. It made literally no sense whatsoever for earth to spend a fortune on cloning some guys, and shipping them to space just to get revenge on a single guy who isn't even in the fight anymore.Spyders war paint is constantly being touched up in the beginning scenes, only to not be touched in the latter 3/4 of the movie, and yet it looks like it's permanently been freshly done.Wildly inconsistent on the water breathing made very little sense.I'll concede that it wasn't shown how much time Jake and Nyteri spent learning their new way of life, but the kids were definitely able to spend a lot of time underwater without issues, yet at the very end it was a seeming impossibility that they spend 2 or 3 minutes to get out of the sinking ship.To go along with this, all the wonderful animals that seem to respond to their daughter, she goes and snags a convenient air balloon backpack one, but doesn't think ahead in the slightest to have a half dozen or so follow her into the ship for her rescue attempt, because that simply wouldn't make any sense...The humans supposed reasoning for hunting the torkun, to get some magical life halting serum... OK sure yup totally possible that this magical serum exists, but how in the world was this discovered ????? Absolutely nothing about the whales was easy hunting, so first it's unlikely that the humans just happened to kill one, second, it's unlikely anyone happened to drill into it's skull 3 feet to drain a random fluid that up until that point would be just ""a fluid"", and third, who's testing out drinking or injecting random brain fluids for YEARS and evaluating that it apparently stops the aging process???? No one. Literally NO ONE. Because the odds of finding it are slim, and even slimmer that they'd be testing it for anti aging.The main thought I had during the movie was how much it mirrored what happened to native Americans. How new vastly superior technology was brought to bear against them.All in all it was a mostly beautiful film that made very little sense."
"Excellent cinematography and CGI. Visually stunning throughout even without 3D. Story picks up where first movie and book ended.Lots of family interaction and new habitats and creatures. Seems to have a target for Youth and adults with Avatar children engaged. The story could be better with a few more sun plots added. Seems to get a little stale and confusing in the middle, but picks up in the end.But there is a lot of fighting and graphic violence at times which could have been reduced. . Similar to the first Avatar movie. Probably could trim the film back by 15 - 30 minutes without losing content.Overall it's still a great movie."
"Jake Sully has to protect his family, and Pandora, from a huge threat.Sound familiar? The plot was thinner than a wafer's top later, but there is no denying the impressive visual feast that is Avatar 2.If you love special effects, action sequences, or simply have a sense of nostalgia for the original, I would recommend, however if you're seeking something new, you may find it a little lacking.I've read several of the reviews here, some comment about how it didn't feel long, personally I felt it was at least an hour too long, they could have easily edited it just a little, this trend for three hour long movies isn't for everyone, it can be hard to sit that long, especially when you get a little older.What concerned me, was the quiet screen, for such a highly anticipated film, the screen was half empty, was the decade long gap too much, or have people abandoned the cinema?Opinion: Worth going to see, support the cinemas."
"I've been ridiculously excited to see the long-awaited Avatar sequel since I first heard about its release, and I wasn't disappointed by it. From the moment it started up to the end credits I was in awe by how visually pleasing this film was and at times I felt as if I was transported to Pandora itself. The CGI and the performances in the film were what made it worthwhile. Unfortunately, I felt that the movie was let down by the script. In the film, Jake and his family are trying to protect themselves against the humans (sky people) as well as a familiar villain from the first film - sound familiar? It felt like the storyline for this sequel was an exact replica to the first one except this time they've thrown in a few new characters, creatures and scenery on the planet. As much as I loved watching several of the scenes in the film that followed Jake's family and their lives away from their home in the forest it felt like they were just written in the script to keep the audience captivated by the visuals and encourage them to forget that the plot wasn't really going anywhere. I only really felt gripped an hour into the film as nothing in the first half seemed to really be happening. I also think some of the characters could have been written better as many of them I didn't really care about. Regardless of a couple script issues though the film was thoroughly entertaining and awe-inspiring; I admire the people behind the film's ability to bring such a vivid and beautiful fictitious world to life. I'll definitely be treating the upcoming films with the same level of excitement and it's good to hear that there won't be 13 year intervals between each one! My only concern is that they continue to prioritise the 'human VS alien' cliche storyline in the future films that has already been used twice now and hope that they branch off into something a little bit different in terms of the script otherwise people might start losing interest. Overall, decent follow up to the first film: 7/10."
"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class..."
"The second film had a lot to live up to due to the insane popularity of the first, but it exceeded expectation! The visuals were stunning, the storyline kept me captivated, the new characters were the perfect mix with the original cast to keep it fresh but still have that same feel of the original. The acting was phenomenal and had me in tears a few times. Like I mentioned before, the visuals were so crisp, clear so accurate and puts you into the world of Pandora as if you're there. I'm curious to see what's next as I am now impatiently waiting after seeing this movie twice. It is long, yes, but absolutely worth seeing at least once!"
"I never watched movies in theatre anymore. The last time I've done it maybe some twenty more years ago with my wife when we haven't yet had any child.This move I know I wanted to see it on a big screen in 3D IMAX. I have some regret not watching the first Avatar movie (also Transformers series) in a big screen. Honestly I don't really care for the storyline crap or whatsnot, I just want to indulge my visual experience.So I brought all my family (except my eldest son who's in the college and lives in different town a few hundred miles away) to watch it in the theatre. And yes. It's really worth it.Storywise, while it was not that bad, it just mediocre. If the first avatar I rated at 7 this one maybe 5 or 5.5 at most. In fact I felt dissatisfied by those cliches and twists, eg. Like most of american movies, they rooted for an obvious ahole and troublesome guy, who with a cheesy redemption become a main hero, injustifically forgetting all of their previous sins (pretty much forcing a flawed/short-sighted christian ideology to us viewer); or one that obviously imitated from Games Of Thrones: they unchallantly killed the good one for some shock effect; or dumb twist to push over to the next movie which I really don't like; a movie should be fully content by itself, never hold on to the next one like some Mexican soap opera series.Overall if you care enough for the story, this movie is not for you. But if you wanted an amazing visual experience, you have to watch it best on the big screen on IMAX 3D."
"This brings me to the most important strengths of this movie which is all related to the visual aspects, Personally I considered this movie a tool for cleaning the eyes, Great visual panels second to none. And I see that in this movie and after 13 years and with the advancement of technology we will penetrate the magic and beauty of this world, we will see the old Pandora and a familiar side to us and a different and new side of this world. In more than one scene and more than one event I forgot that I am watching a movie scenes, I felt completely that I am inside this world. Also I thought that dealing with all that visiualizations will let them neglect the story side but they didn't Unlike the first part. The acting was amusing specially from Zoe Saldana I got her feelings in a wonderful way. Great movie that is worth seeing."
"I'm going to start of saying that this movie is a milestone in visual graphics, it is stunning and beautiful as well as impressive. The VFX team and the animators deserve everything coming from this point on.That is where it ends though. Cameron really wanted this movie to be 180+ minutes. The entire story could have been told in 120. It's obvious there's an extra hour or so of scenes just there to show the pretty visuals. The story is outdrawn and there are scenes that could have been completely left out and be told by short clips. The slaughter of all the animals is one of those scenes and a scene I'd rather not have seen.Then there's the whole accent going on among the Sully kids, it's ""bro"" this and ""bro"" that, in almost every sentence to a point where it becomes outright annoying to listen to their conversations and lose all interest in the characters, their story and what happens to them.Same goes with Neytiri and her screams and breaths, it sounds like she's had a cold that she never recovered from. I understand that's how the actress sound, but they could have fixed it somehow.Visually stunning with a story and characters that are easily forgotten. I walked out of the cinema not really caring when the next movie will be released."
"I've just finished watching Avatar: The Way of Water at the Harkins Cine Capri at the Scottsdale 101 Theaters in Arizona (the screen is on the scale of IMAX if not larger; the film shows at 8K & 48 fps; and the sound system is the best that Dolby Atmos has to offer).No one has ever done special effects and digital motion capture like this before, including facial expressions and body movements. It feels so real that suspending disbelief isn't hard (which is one of the major problems I had with Avatar I, I kept seeing it as a cartoon all the way through --- well, that problem is gone!).The part I liked best was the first hour, where the film just illustrated how the inhabitants live happily within a balanced and intact ecosystem. Of course, the last hour (of the 3-hour show) descends into conflict, and that is much less enjoyable from my point of view. Why not just devote 3 hours to happy beings living fulfilling lives on a bounteous and nurturing moon? (Pandora is a planetary moon, not technically a planet. The floating islands in the sky go back to Philip Jose Farmer, a scifi writer whom I used to read extensively.)All of this said, it's still very much a great movie --- I'm just the wrong person to drag through extended battle scenes, since I consistently find peace and harmony much more interesting and entertaining.WIthout digging into every corner of the plot, I think Mr Cameron definitely has an agenda he wants to drive home about machines vs. Nature. Despite the fact that he uses very fancy machines to make his films, he clearly sees nature as generally good, and machines as prone to be bad, so the idea that the natural world could overcome machines (in a battle-like way) seems to be attractive to him. However, I don't really follow along with him on that line of thinking!My view is quite different. I believe that machines and nature can coexist in harmony. I'll agree we're not very good at it yet, but I quite like machines and nature both --- in fact, I believe that well-designed machines can protect nature and make it more secure, integrated and beautiful.Despite my criticisms, Avatar: The Way of Water is quite a success as a film overall. I rated it 8/10, with the 2 points off for its overemphasis on violence and conflict."
"Avatar: The Way of The Water, is visually, spectacular. The glowing water and amazing animals, exhibits how advanced CGI really is. However, the story lacked emotion and was clearly focused on showing the beauty of their Planet and how their society works. I understand that James Cameron wanted this movie to be a tree hugging movie to captivate the audience, making them want to help our planet. Extreme creativity and current world issues don't go hand in hand. Making it so creative (which I love) defeats the purpose of tackling a real problem that Cameron wants us all to contribute to ending. I extremely respect his passion for ending climate change but placing this topic in a Avatar movie doesn't work. James Cameron is clearly very fascinated by technology in filmmaking. This has taken a toll on his love for story telling. The story telling in Avatar: The Way of The Water lacks emotion and just simple captivity. I'm not a massive fan of if 3 hour movies, but a movie of that length needs to captivate the audience and if it doesn't, it just won't entertain the audience. In conclusion, this movie is visually breathtaking but lacks emotion and basic storytelling needs for a movie."
"Avatar: The Way of Water is delightful to the eye, intense to the heart and unbelievable to the mind.It was a joyful experience to watch this movie on the big screen, you feel every little detail of this movie, every motion of the characters, with a dynamic and breath-taken photography.The actors are very well instructed of what to do, how to act, and the direction and writing paid attention to small phenomenal details in expressions and reactions, even the studies about indigenous people and their reactions to certain things.I don't think this movie have anything of ordinary, it's a stunning movie, with a great cast, fantastic performances and immense scale. You almost feel it is an open world experience, where you explore Pandora with the characters and suffers the same pains as they do.Please, give yourself the right to watch this movie, this is one of the few recent movies that is an absolute must see!"
"The good:The Avatar universe is amazing, and congratulations to everyone involved in making this world.It's very emotional, towards the ending, which made me cry. I did not expect the death of one of the Sulivans, simply. And then, to see him in heaven, along the encounter with his father, while fishing, in the present and as a child is so powerful. Also to see him as a baby. Damn it James!The less good:The movie is too long. 3 hours is way too much time, no matter the movie.Some parts of the story are way too predictable/cliches.**Tom sum it up, it was a long wait, lots of hype. The movie wins, because of the emotional side that, in the end, beats all of the technical quality."
"The story is sucked out of your finger. The beginning is so grandiose, there is so much equipment, scale, and at the end there is a war with one whaling boat and only because of the revenge of one do not understand why resurrected (which costs a lot of money) cuckoo driven psycho...
Jake is kind of a coward. It seems that family life was so affected, they ran away, abandoned the tribe, etc., other tribes scared from the five soldiers...
The music throughout the film is the same from the first part, intelligent whales that can talk, you don't understand where everyone went in the final scene, except for the main characters. No character development.In short, just because of the nice graphics... 3/10."
"Avatar: The Way of Water is a really amazing movie that has some really not amazing plot/story/writing parts. Overall, I think I liked the original Avatar better, especially in theaters as it evoked so much more emotion and feeling in me, however, the final/third act of Avatar: The Way of Water is some of the best I have seen in a while.The cons in this movie are kind of obvious. There is a sort of hasty exposition in a way, but it instantly pulls us all back to Pandora. However much of the exposition, and some other events/things in the plot are unexplained and just happen. There are also a few things that happen that only occur to make something else occur down the road and then are never mentioned again. I wish they could have spent a little more time setting up the actual story/beginning, but overall it isn't too bad. There are also a few odd dialogue decisions specifically with Spider, whose dialogue is quite poor, and he isn't a great/interesting character as a whole. One last thing is that one of the 'good guys' dies, and it is the character they spent the least time developing overall, so the emotion and sadness you're supposed to feel isn't that strong.What I really loved about Avatar 2 is I was always having fun, and I always enjoyed it. I felt invested into the story and I was amazed at the beauty and emotion on screen. Personally, I loved bringing back Sigourney Weaver as Kiri and she was probably my favorite character. I also enjoyed how time was spent developing almost every character we see onscreen and seeing them at their best and worst. I understand that we all expected a movie centered around Jake and Neytiri, and it is at times definitely their movie, but I think that it's more the kids, and at times the Colonel's movie and really about them as people.Avatar: The Way of Water is an amazing, fun, and exciting movie with beautiful technical aspects, that at times struggles with poor writing and set-up. While it doesn't quite live up to the first, this is more than a worthy sequel that is truly enjoyable and has one of the best acts in years, while also setting up what should be a really good Avatar 3. Definitely necessitates a rewatch!"
"This movie was a trip, not even knowing it was close to 4h long, i was engaged through the whole movie. As this movie is the best of all worlds where character relations and plot are at the forefront of this movie. You get attached to characters you never thought you would care for, granted even with the slow crawl of the beginning of the movie can put some off, it all comes to be worth it in the end. This movies is a journey where the beginning it holds ur hand and just shows and establishes a lot, then it let's go for you to experience the movie through any one character you care for, since theres one for everyone, personally i was hooked on all of them and seeing them all go through their own struggles and journeys really brings the movie together instead of making it feel bloated and overstuffed. It works masterfully to expand an existing world and make your mind wonder to what happens next."
"This movie is a perfect example of how it takes more than the latest special effects techniques, and CGI graphics, to turn the movie into a hit. While the visuals are notably spectacular, and the realism of the animated characters are very lifelike, the story lacks the essential elements to make this movie as much of a hit as the first one. The storyline seems contrite and difficult to follow. If you do not manage to grasp the concept of what Cameron is trying to convey in the first 20 minutes then you will be lost for the rest of the movie. There is no doubt this movie smashed the box, office records, but this may have been from the initial fanfare and newlywed relationship with it. I feel that once the publics love affair with the movie exits the honeymoon phase the box, office, receipts, will decline I anticipate this movie moving to a streaming platform in a few months from now. I am a very big fan of James Cameron's work and enjoy almost every movie he has made, but sometimes sequels don't hit the mark as is the case with this one. If you are a diehard Avatar fan, give it a shot, otherwise give it a miss. Hopefully this mediocre storyline will not set the tone for the upcoming Avatar 3 and 4 releases due to be released by 2025."
"I watched the first Avatar movie not too long ago and I understood why people loved it so much. The visuals were like nothing I had ever seen and it got me hyped for this second film. And after seeing it in the cinema I can say that I was not disappointed. Just like the first movie, the visuals are top notch. While the story is a little simple, I still loved the movie anyways. It does have some filler scenes in it but even the filler scenes weren't as bad as you'd think they would be. So should you go see this movie in theaters? Absolutely! Typical James Cameron, he was not able to disappoint."
"The most incredible movie I've ever seen. Cativating story, perfect and extraordinary visual effects (I mean, how did he do it?!?!). I honestly have no words. It's not a movie, it's an experience - and I wanna live it again and again (even though it lasts 3 hours). It makes you feel all kinds of things: excitement, sadness, happiness, frustration, fear, relief... And it's just SO BEAUTIFUL aesthetically! The saddest moment is when the movie ends and you have to go back to reality outside of the beautiful and amazing world that is Pandora. I felt like a teenager: impressed, excited about life and hating every adult human that destroy the Earth. And it also made me wanna go for a swim (and I don't even like swimming). It's a 10."
"INTRO:
When the first Avatar film was released in 2009, I was like 2 years old by then. But growing up, I repeatedly watched that film and it became one of my greatest favorites. For the longest time, I have been wondering when will there be a sequel to the film. But months ago, as I heard the sequel, I was very very excited. I really looked forward into the film.REVIEW:
Last night (Dec. 17, 2022), we watched the film, and my jolly it was my first time to see the IMAX cinema full (which unusually there are like few people). This was truly an exciting thing for me.I personally rate this as 9/10. The graphics and the immersion of the story is so great. But when it comes to the story, the story here does not always really catch up to my attention, unlike the first Avatar, but still the story is nice. So for me, its still a must to watch the film :-))( RECOMENDATION: Watch it on IMAX )"
"Wow! I'm impressed. This movie was really well done! I don't really have any complaints with the storytelling. Sure it hits similar beats as the first one, but this time most of it is told through Jake and Neytiri's children, and just like last time they spend a good majority of the first two acts expanding the world of Pandora. You thought it was beautiful just in the forests? Naw! The oceans are just as spectacular.Another thing that Hollywood has seemingly forgotten about is the family dynamic, which in my opinion is the high point of this movie. It's the main drive of the story, and it helps Jake and Neytiri grow as characters themselves.I'm excited for Avatar 3 and 4 and for what it has in store for us next. It was nice to revisit Pandora again after 13 years and I'm ready for more."
"Since this is a direct continuation of the first installment, this one is bound to a level of comparison. In the first Avatar we saw the ginormous tree of souls, it's grandeur and it's destruction. We saw the navi people gather in huge numbers like 20k plus and then some more with the help of ewa. We saw toruk maktow in all his majestic and fearsome nature. Well, the thing is we got nothing like that in this installment. Don't get me wrong, there's enough bone to chew on: good cinematics, good storyline, good acting, bit of comedy, 3 major action sequences it's all there, worth the buck spent on movie theatres and popcorn. The only thing is the installment is supposed to outshine the last one only here it's the opposite. Bit of a letdown if you ask me!"
"This was a very good and a bit traumatic experience after 13 years to watch the sequel
Good as it was a case of a sudden but ad dur to several budgetary and watching reasons . First let me focus on the bad reasons and skipping the budgetary. The movie has been watched in a regional city with only one multiplex cinema with small halls and quite low illumination. The Dolby glasses were very dirty. Cleaning them helped very little . Watching was relatively difficult and required frequent glass removals to calm my eyes.Now the good: as with the previous story this story is hugely CGI based though it was also 'filmed' in the sea, possibly New Zealand as noticed by other reviewers or in the trivia. Landscapes nicer than in the first installment and the ewier copesinto a totally new underground world. There is still some negative as most of the movie is near 2D that can be watched without glasses even partially... More than the 2/3trd has not deep scenes at least for this cinemaNow to comment to other reviewers :Movie is surely with some flaws with first and most possible reason to deliberately troll anyone. Think that as a kind of advertising that works even if negative as happens with the movie troll (my previous review) . Second the movie is mostly CGI based this work requires very long time to get in 2D add then the time to design into 3D and get thje satisfactory results required with possibly lots trial and error> I read in the trivia that the design was around 3000 hours long,Third has anyone seen on how many movies Cameron made in all this time in between? T a blink I measured 14 movies video games amd TV series in total in the mean time . Don't forgat that all of his productions are primarily strong action movies where text passages only help the story go far! IF someone is interested in movie with higher or stronger character arcs is better to watch another movie . I still think that there is some fair arc especially when they moved to the oceanic landscapes in the query of a new home .Amd also the emotional part: my daughter was deeply pushed by the story tearing in the end. AS teenage she is fan of mostly crap music and actions scenes but the story between the local 'guy' and mark's daughter plus the marginal but glorious winning against the bad humans made her cry. Possiby an easy watcher? She prefers of watching stories Instagram and tok-tok for quite long time everyday ...Another questions of trolling (read as flaws ): The Navis human behavior nearly similar behavior of the Metkayina a Maori inspired clan in the islands not to say the English language used for all the movie instead of designing a more tribal or just using a aboriginal . Also How the 'whale hunters' were found in this planet? How this family adopted teen could inhale in the jungle without mask or it is supposed to die as in the first installment ? There is something also hidden well in the story...The movie for sure takes the rate of 8/10 hugely based in the excellent 3Dlandscapes (5/2) with long story for pop scorn without requiring too much 'after sales' thinking."
"Admitted, I like a lot of what Cameron made, but ""Avatar 2"" is form and surface over substance. He and his team have almost 200 minutes, and sure, we get quite a lot: National Geographic nature porn as well as fighting galore. The visuals of Pandora and the new tropical ocean site are really beautiful, of course. Another given is that humans exploit and kill this beautiful nature for profit, which is indeed heart-wrenching.On the other hand, Cameron doesn't use the 3+ hours of runtime in a well-balanced way. So much time, but none spent on character development. Yeah, these are the kids of the great Jake Sully and Neytiri (and I really liked the gifts of Kiri), so we can infer the pressure and the danger, but we don't learn much about their personality-except for being rebellious, stubborn or whatever-to really care. And we only get banal truisms of what family life means. If only Cameron had given us more personal insights and a punch or fireweapon less ...By the way, the computer animation looks pretty realistic, but I'm really not a fan of HFR (high-frequency rate) projections. And some of the camera effects, like small whip pans, didn't work well for me. I would have liked a smoother camera."
The storyline mirrored the previous storyline. Jake Sully and his family join another tribe and learn their way of living. I am a fan of the overall plot that is based around family and what it means to be a father. The movie did also touch on subjects most movies would not (losing a child). This made me feel some type of way which is what movies are all about.James Cameron did manage to keep Hollywoods liberal agenda out of the film which is a plus. The CGI is absolutely amazing. I do think they could have went a hundred different ways with the story line but all in all I am pleased. I usually don't agree with bringing back an antagonist from the dead but this seemingly fit well in the story.There were some holes throughout the film and I do need to watch a second time to truly get my full opinion.
"Left the movie theater phased, this movie really did so well it's so hard to explain! The detail, the story, the scenes everything!! I'd go back to see this 3 more times!Left the movie theater phased, this movie really did so well it's so hard to explain! The detail, the story, the scenes everything!!

"I could see why they consider James Cameron a visionary and genius ! If you want to make a documentary about a planet that doesn't exist and make it feel so real to the degree that you start personally relate to it and yet create great battle scenes , fights and also emotional reactions between the inhabitants of that planet ! Have at it because that won't be easy and yet James Cameron did that in both movies !! I don't know what's wrong with the people who are complaining about the movie not having a good story yada yada , He wasn't trying to remake Shawshank redemption ! Personally I enjoyed every moment of the movie and it was of the best movie experiences in my life , better to watch in 3D though, It's mind blowing how real it felt and how good were the effects were !!!"
"Sure, this movie is visually stunning, and kudos to the special effects team, that probably spent the yearly budget of a small country, in creating the jaw-dropping special effects.But the story, is strung out and for the most part cookie-cutter boring. There is no real purpose or meaning behind the story except for.. ""bad guys return, and try to ravage our planet, and destroy us.... again"".And of course, we can't have a ""new bad guy"" we have to (much like a Jason Vorhees or Michael Myers film..) resurrect the bad guy, to have him have yet another crack at our band of do-gooders.I think this is, by far James Cameron's worst cinematic effort yet, and makes other movies I seen this year, look that much better. Films are supposed to elicit an emotional reaction from us, get us feeling and thinking. All I got from this 3 hour and 15 minute movie was the feeling to snooze.From this film maker, who has created some of my most favourite cinematic memories from Aliens, The Abyss, T2 to Titanic, who even self-declares himself as being ""able to do what others can't..."".... I expected better... much better."
"I liked this movie.Yes, the story is simple and the characters aren't especially complex, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The story was still gripping to me and I actually liked the plot slightly better than Avatar 1.Not that this movie doesn't have its own similarities. This one had moments that reminded me of James Cameron's Titanic. But the similarities of Avatar 2 did not feel as on the nose as they did in Avatar 1, which felt to me completely like Blue Pocahontas in Space.The children (very often I find that child characters are badly done in action movies) did not annoy me either. There were actually moments when I liked them too, so that's good as well.Naturally, the most important thing about this movie is, just like the first one, its visuals. I have no complaints about them this time either, but the truth is that the 2nd time around the technical aspects were not as impressive or awe inspiring as it was the very first time I experienced it, so there's not much more to say about it than ""we expected it to be great and it was""."
"Maybe one day humans get to understand that they don't go anywhere with money and fame and power. Everything we get on this Earth stays on this Earth. We get to leave with what we came, and if we understand a few things, with so much more on a soul level. Hopefully the next Avatar will be different, and the film will make a change in the world. This one only fed us with even more violence, revenge and fear, things we already have had lately. I expected something different, but I only got very bored during the film and regretted that I wasted my time and contributed at the gains of an industry which really needs to change."
"If you liked the first Avatar, you will love this one.Visually stunning - the effects are simply astonishing in their realism. Each frame is gorgeous to look at.The story has more emotional impact than the first film. The careless devastation wrought by humans on a beautiful ecosystem is on full display. The impact on indigenous people is front and centre.Unobtainium is never mentioned, but has been replaced by another McGuffin material (essentially whale brain fluid). The comparison to rhino horn or bison tongue is obvious.As with the first film, the story is as subtle as a brick, but that is not necessarily a bad thing.And we get to see Sigourney Weaver playing a teenager!"
"Immersive, fun movie going experience! Don't understand the people who hated it, if they know what the first film was like. To each his own! Avatar 2 had a lot of heartfelt moments, some of the best, if not THE best graphics of any film in decades, and great action scenes as well! There weren't huge plot twists, or the best humor of all time, but I thought the family story and spectacle more than made up for that. The film looked best on Dolby Cinema 3d, and I also watched it on Imax at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. I'll def watch it again! So far I've seen it three times.I am a James Cameron fan, and just rewatched True Lies, and def the humor hits better in that film than in Avatar 2, and you can see in Avatar that the family dynamic has become much more the focus of the story, along w/ making the next generation the focus. I think they did that more successfully than in Top Gun Maverick (which I loved overall), but felt the young pilots were mediocre characters. In Avatar, upon multiple viewings, I really came to like the character of teenage Sigourney Weaver (this is not a spoiler, as it's out there everywhere).Don't miss this film in 3d in the theaters, as you don't know when there will be a chance to catch it again."
"First of all, this was a visual tour de force, although the unnatural blue skin takes some getting used to, and almost imparts a cartoon feeling (as in the Schroumps), broken only by the seamless integration of apparent actors in the flesh. The technical and artistic aspects were unparalleled. There was also two-dimensionality to characters, save for that of Sigourney Weaver, and the second son.From a moral and philosophical viewpoint, there was no novelty. A) Man spoils the earth, and wants to move to a beautiful but toxic aired planet already occupied by eco-Indigenous, b) Enormous heavy arms and two-dimensional depictions of soldiers with no conscious or common sense counterbalanced by the few sympathetic humans and the noble ""savage"" indigenous. C) A highly interconnected planet with shared consciousness between Navi, plants, animals, bird/dragons and marine creatures.I think there should be no more sequel, but the mad soldier killed in Avatar 1 remains the baddie thread as he had been resurrected into a Navi body, and, even in Avatar 2, he is saved so that an Avatar 3 screenplan would keep the crazy violet conflict going.This is too much of the neverendum franchisum Hollywood disease. There are no themes left to explore (Man killing earth. Man violent and sociopath; Scientists good, military mad, merchants greedy; Indigenous very primitive tribal society but domestication of animals obviate technological need.) Nothing new in themes from Avatar 1.The action scenes were too much a central feature of the narrative. There was little balance with other human interaction or ""being interaction"" other than the cartoony ""family togethernes"", right vs wrong simplicity, and ostracism of those ""different"". The final act in the sinking hydrofoil battleship lacked logic. The protagonists had no reason to keep trying to reach air as the ship rolled over and sank; surely, they could have held their breath and called their marine steeds? It's also unlikely that guns that shoot bullets faster than the speed of sound could be outdone by arrows. In addition, what happened to the masses of water Navi who launched the final attack? All we see afterwards are the protagonist family until the ending scene back at the village."
"Feel like I've seen it all before. A long winded story - and not much story. Same old same old American army mad man and his minions. Ridiculous now all seems a little out of date still hunting and slaughtering, like we've learnt nothing over the last few decades. And an hour too long.story is weak. Three hours to catch jake. With some whale chasing thrown in the middle of it all. But for some reason I couldn't careless about any of it with the ridiculous stereotype army major ruining any sense of realness- and seems unfortunately he will be back in the next movie. Production was as you'd expect with the 3d version giving some amazing could and beauty. Shame there just wasn't more of that."
"Have a feeling James Cameron should have kept Avatar to the one film...Knowing that there's another 2 films to come is a bit farcical.I thought the film was quite slow in parts but you'd expect that from a 3 hour flick. You can't fault the graphics, it's what the film is known for. And I highly recommend seeing in IMAX Theatre.I would've like this to come away from let's call it Avatar 1. With a few of the same characters but not the same ""villains""...also why they transformed them back into new Avatar just seemed like poor scriptwriting to me. All seemed a bit rushed, failing to see the big picture for the rest of the film series."
Yes James Cameron has done it again. Despite the controversery that the first Avatar movie was made box office due to it being the first 3D film and with motion graphics he has proved it that's not the case. Second only to Top Gum Maverick now it is the highest box office movie in 2022. I was very eager to watch it after so many years and was happy to see that they have not changed the feel and the emotions attached to the first film. The only changes were the duration of the movie and the incredible effort done by VFX. I was so stunned by the underwater effects it felt so surreal when compared to other movies. The only two issues were where were Ronal and rest of the sea avatars when Jake Sulley and rest of the family were fighting since their daughter Tsireya. Was helping them too at the moment. And I felt the middle part of the movie should have had an action sequence. Overall the performance by the actors and actresses were outstanding. The emotions felt real. Thanks for such a beautiful masterpiece.
"A beautiful film that was really worth the wait, the story wasn't very well written, as if it was just a different starting point.However, in terms of this year's films, we got one of the best sci-fi films along with Dune.Also, I really liked that they wrote new and interesting characters, but didn't really flesh them out, like Grace's daughter...
The symbols are very well thought out, I like for example that Grace's daughter is like Jesus, born with an immaculate conception and that she can control the moon's ecosystem. I hope in part 3 there will be more emphasis on them...
And in the end, after the movie I felt like Cameron was just preparing us for the third part, because for me this movie just introduced the new place, the new characters and the ""new"" conflict... Nothing really happened but that's ok, that's how good this movie was.(This movie will make you cry)"
"Yes this was a simple story. Yes this had cliched and one dimensional characters. But you know what, I don't care. I don't remember the last time I felt that inside a movie theater.James Cameron does it again. Avatar 2 is a visually stunning masterpiece. Jake and his family will make you root for them. You will laugh and cry. This movie makes you face humanities worst but also shows you humanity should be about.For 3 hours I was lost in another world and forgot everything else. What a phenomenal experience. You are not doing this movie justice if you are not watching it in IMAX 3D. Ignore the reviews and go watch it."
"Avatar 1 was a cinematic marvel. It was unique a true experience of an outer planet never shown before. Star Wars and Star Treks were just dumbed down versions of outer space. No wonder it captured the world's imagination and went on to become the highest grossing film ever. How do you beat that experience ? Cameroon knew he has to deliver the audience with another new unique experience.Smartly after long research he delivers the water world of Pandora. I bet you it's the most realistic under water shots you ll ever see in cinema, no one is even close well may be National Geographic or Discovery but not in 3D. The last 40-45 mins of action sequence is masterfully crafted and you cannot get anything better than that forget John wick. But is it enough ? Let's find out.Just like Avatar 1, the story takes lots of inferences from events in real world and Cameroon's own films. Avatar 1 dealt with Mining and land protection, tribal rights, tribal uprising and climate change. Avatar 2 carries the same theme forward but now it's focus is towards the family as well as a little towards animal cruelty. While it adds emotional connect with family angle but it also disconnects us by not focussing on the more global pressing issues which affects humanity on Earth that first Avatar did. The first Avatar let us feel the pain and loss of a community caused by human greed and what happens when community fights back which the 2nd missed. Hence the emotional connect is somewhat lost or you may call it diluted.The first hour of the movie was a little incoherent and long setup. They could have cut that by at least 20 mins. In the first movie the actual villian was not Col Miles but it was human greed however in Avatar 2 they actually made col Miles
the villian which I felt was a downgrade from
first one. He was a totally one dimensional character. I would not have minded that if Cameroon could have explored the diplomacy angle of Earth. No one gets to world dominion with all guns blazing. A huge part is played by diplomacy and soft power. You cannot just abandon it after one revolt.The water world looks great but the details is somewhat kept secret. Whatever is shown is shown at the surface level. There are literally no conflicts shown except within the kids. Kate Winslet and water world had no major role in final showdown. The Titanic themed last 10 mins was unnecessary and felt like a forced nostalgia.The last but not least, like in all Cameroon films the writing is borderline terrible. Most conversations end with a phrase or sentence containing the least words possible.You must be thinking I have listed mostly negative points yet I gave it an 8 why ? The answer is the movie is long but rarely felt slow. The visual prowess of this movie is breathtaking. It can easily trick you to ignore the negatives. So why the negatives ? Because those points if not improved upon might haunt future Avatar movies. Reinventing visuals in every sequel will be very very difficult. Law of diminishing marginal utility will kick in. Good writing can enhance the story to next level with less incremental improvement in visuals.Avatar 2 has now crossed $ 2 billion. I am predicting Avatar 3 to be under $ 1.5 billion as I don't see anything significantly new in this front. Cameroon needs to hire good writers he has the vision. He should take up the visual director role and let the good writers do what they do best. Avatar 2 was mostly a copy of Avatar 1 event wise. The movie could have been 30 mins shorter but the studios can't tell that to a successful Cameroon.One more issue is that most audiences worldwide were not able to experience the movie on premium screens. Most theatres and by most I mean 80% are still on 2K 3D with very low brightness. It looks awful knowing that premium screens are in 4K and brighter.Most negatives above are an after thought. It would have elevated the experience and probably let Avatar 2 cross the $ 3 billion mark if those issues were not present. I'm giving it an 8 as it still manages to wow you but you can see the faint cracks on the strong surface of $ 2 Billion."
"James Cameron has done it again. This movie is entertaining from start to finish. You'll be flooded with gorgeous visuals for every second of this movie. Not just visually beautiful but also emotionally and thematically. This movie uses its story to deliver a great message about protecting your family and protecting your oceans. And a movie that succeeds at telling both deserves all the praise that it warrants. The movie does not drag in it's run time. As soon as I realized I was in the third act I thought the movie had only past the hour mark when I was actually past the 2 and half hour mark. If that doesn't tell you how much I enjoyed it, i don't know what does."
"""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is an impressive movie from start to finish. The story is exciting, with complex characters and an impressive world. The cast is exceptional, with impressive performances from the lead actors. James Cameron's direction is impressive, achieving a visually stunning experience with incredible special effects.The film is a continuation of the first avatar, and takes place in the world of Pandora, its story is spectacular and full of profound messages about the relationship between humanity and nature, respect for living beings and the importance of preserving the environment. Ambient. Environment. The movie also has a great message about the importance of community and the fight for freedom.In summary, ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is an impressive film that does not disappoint in any way. It's exciting, visually stunning, and full of deep and exciting messages. Without a doubt, I give it a score of 10/10. This is definitely one of the best sci-fi movies I've seen in recent times. I would definitely recommend watching this movie at the theater for the full viewing experience."
"Ok...Many people will come here and attack this. This is my opinion only and what I feel about this movie. Visually, this movie is a masterpiece in how to engage an audience on what is happening on the screen. I loved how the worlds melded into a reminiscence of the original. The Tech behind and in front of what my eyes saw on that screen was incredible and stunning.That being said....this was a movie with only ONE audience being catered to. Where was the credible and believable plot?? Why was the destruction by ""some!!!"" Government and Marines glossed over when they first landed???. Why was that needed in this story? Why was there total destruction when they landed???How does this make the one country on Earth who is rep in this conflict look good????I'm sorry Guys. You can spend 100's of millions of dollars on a movie, and make make a Billion+ on it but...this movie was not for me. I loved the first one, this one missed the mark, by a long shot."
"The first five minutes of the movie confused me. All sorts of new thing's implemented to the Avatar planet without ANY context. Visually stunning?! Yes of course, I was captivated by the first battle scene. Could've used more of that and less chopped up, half assed character building moments. It felt like they were trying to create three seasons of character building within 3 hours. Overall, my 5 star rating is based around the following:-Subpar acting (too many one liners)
-No sense of true direction
-Great visual effects
-Laughed more than a comedy showFor what it's worth, my rating is about the dragged on scenes that felt like on repeat."
"Watching Avatar: The Way of the Water on the big screen was very enjoyable I must say. To start the film looks beautiful. I guess I wasn't overly impressed by the visuals as you see them all the time in movies now. They sorta looked the same as the first one.Let's start by talking about some of the pros.Of course as I've mentioned the visuals are definitely good and probably the main reason I was convinced to go see it.More expansion and a deeper look into Pandora. I liked seeing the Water tribe and I thought they were really cool. The connection between the animals and creatures was strong throughout the film.Character development was really strong. I thought they did a good job in introducing characters without making them annoying like other films. Apart from characters like the little sister or the older brother who didn't get much screen time or focus everyone else had their chance to shine.Throughout the film I was engaged and it was incredibly easy to follow (not that that's a good thing).Now onto the cons.Story. Oh dear. I have to say the story was pretty weak. I was expecting something a lot bigger with a lot more oomf. Stephen Langs character comes back as an avatar and wants to seek revenge on Sam Worthington. Meanwhile the Earth is dying and humans want to come over to Pandora and kill all the natives there (because as always humans are portrayed as mindless brutes who just kill)Emotional attachment. I didn't think that the film did a very good job at building up emotion and attachment. Maybe to some other people an alien whale dying will make you cry but not me. I just sat there waiting for the scene to end. When the older brother died I didn't feel anything. Zoe Saldanas character always does that eat piercing wail every time something bad happens. When he said ""I want to go home"". I mean come on James Cameron. How cliche is that. They couldn't have thought of a better line that hasn't been used a million times before.At most points in the film especially during the middle it felt like a documentary. A lot of people have also said this. Not that it's a bad thing its just I would've liked it bit more action to get the pace flowing.The film was really long but I enjoy 3 hour films so that didn't matter.It is worth a watch if you like avatar. It definitely feels like a sequel and a lot of foreshadowing was portrayed. Stephen Langs character looks like he will become a main ""villain"" in the franchise. I'm not overly excited to the other 3 movies that will come but it will be cool to see how the writers play around with the story.Hopefully they'll come up with something a little more creative.Not bad but not a showstopper.7/10."
"Slow start that led to an amazing story about family. The most visually beautiful movie I've ever seen. Epic ending with emotional action that made the 3 hours feel like it was too short, 13 years in the making well worth it.In Awe of #AvatarTheWayOfWater visuals & emptions. @JimCameron is surely decades ahead of time with Technology & NarrationYears of hardwork, passion and vision is now giving a surreal BIG Screen experience. Enjoyed every second, loved every frameKudos to entire team.The true MVP of AVATAR: THE WAY OF WATER in my book. Loved Kiri, and this was genuinely the best Sigourney Weaver has been in probably a decade. She was such an interesting character and so well realized."
"I went to cinema without high expectations. I thought it's gonna be visually beautiful but I didn't expect it to be on level the first movie was. And I was mistaken. This part is amazing if not better than the first one. Maybe I am still under hype cause I just saw it, but really this movie is wonderful. James Cameron really know how to do scenes under water. He knows how to give you heroic moment of each character. He spent years developing each character and he did it well.I am so excited to see another part. This is really a movie you will want to see again. Can't wait for another part to hit cinemas!!"
"Graphics are the best but the dialogues the story lines or not upto the mark so maybe that's not the best of his, something that good to top the IMDB chart but good enough to watch only because of the graphics and graphics only. If yoy are looking for something something amazing you may be disappointed because the story the suspense the action that all is missing just the visuals. We can't say in Cameron disappointed us because as expected and and as Avatar is known for is basically for graphics. And in the first movie at least much of the story line suspense, a bit of action sequences which were much better than the second one. So if you have never been to any aquatic life like Andamans in our country this movie might be a chance to that view."
"Before I start explaining what I liked and didn't like in Avatar The Way of Water, I must say that I was afraid that the movie will be much inferior to the 2009 movie. But after watching it yesterday, thank God, all what I was afraid of has gone far far way.In Avatar The Way of Water, everything deserves praise. The visual and sound effects, cinematography, soundtrack, use of colors, performances of the cast (especially Worthington, Saldana, and Lang), addition of the water world and Metkayina clan, action sequences, direction, screenplay, and emotional weight, all deserve praise in every sense of it.What deserves praise also is that the movie had no boring minute, even if its runtime is 192 minutes. On the contrary, I wished that the movie was longer.Regarding the flaws, the only thing that I criticized in Avatar The Way of Water is the story because from my point of view, it wasn't bad, but it did not add anything new to the world of Avatar and Pandora.Avatar The Way of Water is one of the best movies that I watched this year, not only this year, but also during the last 10 years. That is why regarding the score, I gladly give Avatar The Way of Water 9 out of 10."
"I enjoyed this movie as much as I enjoyed the 1st one, but this one having more stunning visual effect and fantasy.The 1st one tells a lot about definition of the Avatar and the story is more than the 2nd, but the 2nd is more enjoyable on the amazing views and the story does not run as deep as the 1st one.3 hours just passed without we even realize, means that we just keep watching and awaits another suprises (on the view, scenery and other detail aspects). So the CGI or whatever the technology used to develop this movie is just awesome.The story is easy to follow and enjoyed and not to emotionally shaking as the 1st."
"First ... CGI it's so gorgeous so it crashed Cinema City projector.I could get over but soon I was pissed off by the unbelievable event where , the main villan from Avatar 1, was resurrected in form of avatar colonel. Pointless and stupid. Colonel failed his mission right ?! No logic to send him again.Never seen water on Avatar 1 , but for some reason, on a planet where mountains are floating in the air, there are oceans floating too. Ok , my mistake ... It's a fantasy movie.But why copy pasting same story from Avatar 1 ? For some moments I thought I'm watching a Star Wars sequel.Be aware, that this movie have too many avatars tied to fences. Many times ... for dumbest reason.Don't liked this movie and I'm big fan of Avatar 1.Just stay away from this one because it's really bad."
"As so many people are saying, this film has incredible VFX. This aspect of the film has not disappointed audiences.As a massive fan of the first film, I absolutely loved the subtle and not so subtle hints and references to the original. Everything from big plot points to reused shots and lines, it helped include the first film into the rest of the saga. But this strategy is risky for James Cameron.The risk lies in the episodic feeling - it seems as though The Way of Water has been written as if it is an episode of a TV show. Leaving ends untied and not addressing some things leaves the audience confused. Whilst this works well for a TV show, it doesn't work as well for a feature film intended for cinema.The mystery in a TV show increases its bingeability and allows audiences to pick up on subtle hints in one episode which may turn into a big plot point in another episode. It appears that this is also the case for The Way of Water which dropped hints that will most likely carry over to the next few films. It seems clever on paper and, from a business stance, would encourage audiences to continue to watch the coming films. However, it is clear that it has not been received in the intended way.It was a big gamble to write the film in this way and if it had worked, it could have changed a lot in the filmmaking industry. However, it's not a lost cause, the next few films might put The Way of Water into perspective. Only time will tell.Overall, I loved this film. I think that the foreshadowing throughout the film, the references to the original, and the VFX created an incredible experience. I am excited to see what the next few films hold in terms of storyline, but I only wish each film's plot was kept separate."
"It's visually stunning. You go to the big cinemas for films like this. I saw this in an IMAX 3D and it was extremely worth it. 3D works particularly well for films that take place in weightlessness and in water.The story is no better than the first part. The villain was so good for the makers in the first part that he's even the same this time. But Stephen Lang's great facial expressions don't come that well because of the CGI portrayal as Na'vi.The only CGI transfer (""performance capture"") of the facial expressions to an artificial character that has really succeeded and is a new quality is that of Sigourney Weaver on Kiri. At least for me.By the way, her plot is the most interesting, along with Lo'ak's. How Kiri acts as a kind of sorceress and Lo'ak allies with another outsider is wonderfully told and visually excellent presented."
"Greater visual dazzle, incredible color spelling, images that any random second can be placed on a frame, very advanced capture technology in the history of cinema ... only here do we have several periods of the film without any words we are only admiring the world presented by James Cameron, I believe that 2/3 of the film goes like this, in this magnificent visual glimpse .We have a script that talks about the relationship between father and children, where we realize that the main characters are the children, but we see a feminine power, when you need it most . We have the relationship of avatars with their animals and with nature, but the script becomes repetitive and cyclical, in addition to looking a lot like the first film, here the conflict generates a new conflict, but repeated, that creates the same conflict that they have just resolved.We don't see much character arc, we don't even decorate their names, we end up clinging only to the pandora world, their life and especially the life of their animals.To summarize we have a totally different film, an entertainment note a thousand, even a little elitized, because it only passes in 3d cinemas, but sometimes it seems that the film stops , to introduce us to the avatar world, script to cliché and photography out of the question. It's worth the ticket, for the attraction!"
"Looks good, but the only thing that matters in terms of stakes is Jake's family which is just nothing in the grand scheme of things. Like why do they even continue hunting Jake? He left the forrest tribe, the ones that had to be pacified. So they either stopped fighting and theres no need to hunt Jake or they did and theres no need to hunt Jake again and should even stay to fight back.Besides that, it felt like a lot of the first movie was retold. Newcomer has to learn the ways of the place they now live in. There is an immediate love-interest and a rival. Newcomer has to prove themselvs. Third act contains big battle where someone important dies.And of course we cant have a move in the 2020s without a few open question which we can milk for more money in two years, which just feels like a cheap way out of telling good stories."
"Once again James Cameron introduces us to the world of Pandora in a spectacular way. The main focus of the film is on visuals, just like the first one. Everything is beautiful, but the story is left aside to present us with all this creation of the world. Because it wants to show off the special effects so much, the film stretches too much in scenes that didn't need to, making everything very dull. This is a sequel that surpasses the original in basically every aspect, but it's not great. This is easily the best CGI in the entire history of cinema and that's where the film hits. When we go into the story, it's somewhat better than the first movie, but it's still pretty standard."
"Overall this movie was very lacking in most departments. The acting was subpar, storyline was weak, and it dragged on for longer than it needed to. They couldn't even think of a new villain for the movie so they just said ""hey remember the colonel who thought the avatar thing was a waste of time, well he has one now."" Almost the entire second hour of this movie dragged along I was almost completely asleep through it and still didn't really miss anything important, was able to follow along fine in the third hour. They had way too much irrelevant information that didn't lead anywhere and you can forget about five minutes later. Movie was not worth the 13 year wait, and 3D is not necessary for it either.Also I almost forgot to mention the literal whale poaching scene around halfway through the movie, they hunted, killed and took some oil or something the whales on the planet naturally developed."
"I enjoyed Avatar 2. I felt that I was living on another planet for 3 hours which is down to James Cameron pushing the boundaries of new technology and filming techniques which includes blending CGI and humans seamlessly. I immediately wanted to jump back into a pool after watching it. We see one the most convincing water communities on film and funnily enough they don't even live under water.The film starts off catching us up to date with events since Avatar 1 and reintroduces us to jungle tribe which looks better than ever before. Following this the action and the pace ramps up which makes for a very interesting first act which starts to point us in the direction that the movie is going.In the second act we are introduced to the Way of the Water and it is here that James Cameron takes his time and basically says look what I can do... The pace slows somewhat (and may drag for some) whilst we essentially live in with the new community and witness character development. I personally enjoyed it as the film looks beautiful and sucks you into another world but you do notice the slight dip in pace. In the 3rd act the action picks up again - The action scenes and set pieces are done well, driving up tension and consequence.There is no denying this is one of the most beautiful films ever shot, the story doesn't quite match but it's easy to get onboard with. Simple isn't always bad especially with so much to take in with regards to scenery and characters.We are introduced to several new characters who take a lot of the screen time away from Jake and Neytiri but each character feels different with their personality directly influencing their onscreen decisions. Cameron is uses interesting characters (some more likeable than others) to drive the narrative as opposed to a complex narrative driving the characters.Ultimately Avatar 2 was a captivating spectacle and a fun ride that sucks you in to unique world. It's not perfect but it's a strong follow up to Avatar and conveys simple but universal messages. I would recommend Avatar 2 to anybody that enjoyed the first film or anybody that enjoys fantasy action films."
"The effects are Wow, guess who's winning best special effects at the Oscar's , you must watched it in IMAX 3D . In my opinion the film is on par with the original, the only two criticism,s I have is the film is just to long could have easily made it 2.30 hours and the other is the plot is the basically the same as the first one , instead of save the forest it's save the whales . But it's an amazingly made , so immersive to watch , one of my favourite films of the year and again another James Cameron winner , if where Wowed by the first, the visual alone will blow you away , no wonder the film took so long to make ."
"Saw this twice. Excellent movie. 10/10 . It is impossible to give this movie anything lower than a 9. If you have, you're the problem and you need to assess your entire life. It's visually stunning, plot is solid, acting is great. It makes the world they're in seems like real life. James Cameron is the director of the Century in my opinion. He just doesn't throw a movie together. You can tell he puts his heart and soul into it, hence why it took so long to make. This is one of the few directors that can put u in a 3 hour + movie, and when it finishes, u want more. Keeps u interested throughout. Best movie I've seen in a while, way better than these newer marvel and DC movies."
"I would not have gone to see this movie had my son not dragged me. I figured there was so much more that I could be doing with 3 1/2 hours of my day. But I was very pleasantly surprised. The younger generation made this movie so much better than I was expecting. It was much more than spectacular visuals with vilified human aggressors. There was convincing character development and plenty of suspense. There were a few predictable parts, which convinced my son that I must have somehow seen it before. But, that is to be expected. Honestly, the best movie I've seen in a while. I really enjoyed the technology aspect, as well as the amazing sea creatures."
"The story is awkward & not captivating. The characters are impossible to connect with or care about. That being said, it doesn't matter. The visuals, sound design, sound track, and other worldly atmospheres and landscapes are breathtaking and inspiring. This is what I personally payed for, and I was not let down. Some of the destruction scenes were the best I have ever seen. There are slow scenes in between what I just described that serve almost no meaning, and I would say the movie would've left an even better taste in my mouth if could've been trimmed down by 30 minutes. After 2.5 hours I felt the full effect was achieved and I was ready to go. After this mark, all of the plot points and story line are beyond predictable. Awesome movie though visually- completely mesmerizing."
"Listen, this movie was good and the Visuals were amazing and it was a well written, designed, and executed long awaited sequel to the first film. The first one blew people away with its incredible looking visuals and somehow they did it again with the sequel. But I'm just going to say some of the scenes in the movie just felt like it was there to give the movie extra length and to show off the visuals. To be honest some scenes felt like I was standing in a best buy looking at the tv displays showing 4k drone shots of landscapes that had footage so clear it makes you question if the tv is more clear than your eyesight. But in all honesty it's a great movie with all the new characters each getting introduced into the movie really well and I can't wait to see what James and the avatar crew is cooking up next."
"I just watch the movie I felt am in aquarium not a movie theater
The story is boring nothing interesting
The first avatar is better than avatar 2
It's all about the visuals I didn't care about the characters even there's intense moments I just can't take them seriouslyI love James Cameron movies but I think he's really obsessed with avatar ideas and tryina make it like the lord of the ringsAm sure a lot of people gonna love it but I didn't specialy 10 or 15 years old am sure they gonna love itFor me I just love more strong interesting stories movies with CGI or fantasy and if it's not that good I just can't watch it like
Back to the future, matrix, district 9 , these movies really strong and interesting despite the technology
When I watched it I didn't feel like there is a need for avatar 2
All these years the story very poor
I didn't feel any connection with the avatar."
"Don't waste your money !! The story is written by a 5 year old and the special effects are overhyped. The so called world building is nothing to speak of. The characters are uni-dimensional and not engaging at all. The writers don't give us any reason to care for the Sully family. The audience never gets drawn into their struggles because they are BORING ! One can only watch alien creatures frolicking in the ocean for so long.The sequel just proves James Cameron is all about the gloss, no substance. The movie would have been far more interesting if it revolved around the character of Grace's daughter. We would be more intrigued to know who her father was, what made her different and how the Sully family went out of their way to protect her with their sacrifices and toils."
"These early Avatar movies (1 through 3) are just buildup and world building for Avatar 4 and 5. Cameron himself said that the movies get better and better as they go on.And I suspect Avatar 4 is gonna be amazing (Hollywood people are reportedly losing their minds over the script alone).As for this one, it's pretty solid. On par with the original. The underwater scenes filled me with childlike wonder, and the last hour was surprisingly dark considering how lighthearted the early scenes were. The universe is growing, we're now connected to this family and I'm excited to see this saga unfold. Even if these early films aren't great yet, they will be soon."
"After Avatar 1, watching this movie is horrible.Avatar 1 - Story is based on some suspense, mixed perfectly with amazing new sci-fi concepts and VFX.Avatar 2 - A story which has no suspense at all. Except VFX, nothing is amzing. Even the VFX is not new, old concepts. Very predictable story which is un-necessrily mixed with some kind of spirituality, sounds like children's story. Not sure why this is getting good collections.Avatar-3 - Maybe that story will tell about a Tribe living in the Air, and from Water, the whole scene will be moved to Air. Again, small spirituality will be included to create suspense."
"I was not disappointed. Even though 3 hours, 12 minutes long I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. James Cameron's stamp was all over this movie. We got scenes reminiscent of the first Avatar movie, and it is clear there is a huge love of the sea which I think will continue into the next movie. Imaginative sea creatures abound in the new location and it was super cool. There is a scene that reminds one of Moby Dick, one part reminded me of the Jonah and the whale story, and a long sequence takes us back to James Cameron's Titanic. I hope these are not spoilers. There was also plenty of great action scenes so all the quiet parts did not cause sleepiness in such a long movie. The movie opened up a lot of questions that were not answered, so it seems cruel we have to wait two more years to see how that plays out. I thought there was a good deal of story and character development myself and a nice introduction to some new characters. I especially liked Spider. Spectacles are highlighted with brilliant CG. The only thing that bothered me was the casting of Kate Winslet for the voice of the oldest daughter, Ronal. Her voice sounded too old for the part. I also did not understand why she obsessed about her father. I did not see that as relevant here. Perhaps I missed something?"
"I mean ground breaking graphics well done textures and photo realism i mean breath taking.It definitely went on too long every minute after 2 hours was very much felt.The writing is insanely bad. These were naavi for everyone to talk like an american teenager was painful to endure. And the cringe dialogue was baaaaad the actors were great it was purely the fault of thr writing staff. Definitely going to be a movie theater only movie as it is clearly not meant for the small screen this is dolby/imax only film (in a british accent) this is high cinema not meant for t.v. Beautiful everything every sound and pixel is breath taking
The writing is abysmal."
It might as well be called generic action movie with blue people. Gone is the familiar strong characters of the first movie. Sully has also become a shadow of his former self. Oh and he considers his family being a military squad. You'd might think this is a bad joke but it's perfectly logical considering what type of movie this is.No character development and no story development. Bring ammo to the theatre cause they may run out during the movie. Too much action. Bland action meaningless cause there's so much of it.In the end you're back at point A. Restock redshirts and you can go again. What a joke.No I'm not going to watch it again and I won't buy it.
"You may like it or not but it's a must watch movie on the big screen. It is a cinematic experience. James will take you to this beautiful Pandora world. It is dazzling to watch on the big screen.Story wise, it is just the introduction of new family members of Jake sully and here and there, there are few terrific moments and actually I expected even more action sequences. Its kind of a drag in the end.Overall it is justitied as this is 2nd part and need to keep it low instead of hype in the end. There are 3 more sequels to come and I guess he will build up with each sequel.Lastly, as the title says ""way of water"" it is truly an amazing journey in the Pandora's waters."
"Is this the greatest movie ever made? No. Is this the greatest SciFi movie ever made? No. Is this the best movie even of 2022? No. It isn't even James Cameron's best work. Not by a long shot. Is it better than the first Avatar?Yes.But just by a little.I would've rated the original at about a 7 back when I saw it in the theater those many years ago.The enhanced effects, and to be honest, the lengthy scenes of old school two dimensional action sequences were as unexpected as they were exhilarating.That's what gives this newest edition a slight nudge over the original.But oh my, my, my how long this film is.Admittedly it doesn't feel like over three hours but it doesn't feel like a quick infomercial either.What also drags this movie down is lack of an interesting story, weak cliched dialogue with American slang (which sounds weird when spoken by tall blue people). There's also a young man that walks around the entirety of the movie like a tiny Tarzan or Cha-Ka from Land of the Lost.Who he really reminded me of is the kid from that late 1990's movie, Jungle 2 Jungle. Seriously. And he's in the movie a bunch. It feels like he's in every scene.There are shoutouts aplenty throughout this film, all to Cameron's glory years and far superior earlier films such as The Abyss and Aliens.Will you enjoy this movie in spite of all the things mentioned here?Yes. If you can handle such an intense running time (3+hours!) and you are a fan of the first film. If you cannot answer in the affirmative for either of these, then you are in for a long sit where your mind might occasionally wander and you may check your watch or phone for the time on more than one occasion.I do recommend seeing this film in the theater, in 3D on the most premium screen available in your area.It's been 13 years since the first film. Go see it. And no need to stay any later after the credits as there is no post credits scene here."
"I wasn't the biggest fan of the first Avatar. I thought it was a cool visual spectacle with an underwhelming plot. With that in mind, I had relatively low expectations when I went to see this movie, and it blew them out of the water (no pun intended). The visuals were even better than I expected, and the story was also much more compelling than the first one. There were moments where I found myself forgetting that I was looking at CGI. I can genuinely say that it's the best looking movie I've ever seen. The plot was also solid. It's nothing special, but it was enjoyable. Overall, you can really feel the passion that was put into the movie, and I would recommend seeing it on the biggest screen possible!"
"The visuals are nothing less than stunning. Had this been a BBC nature documentary with David Attenborough narrating, there would have been no doubt that the ecosystem of Pandora, and all its creatures were real. However, it is very much let down by a very weak story and poor writing, as so many effects led films these days. In many ways a repeat of the first story, A-hole colonel comes back to take on Sully and loses. That's it. Why we had to have Sigourney Weaver back as a Na'vi child seemed pointless and added nothing to the story. It's sets up Avatar three as Sully is now angry about the attack on his family and, no doubt, will beat the colonel, who survived, and kick the humans off world again. As I say, visually stunning, but I wish as much creativity was expended on the writing."
"An elaborately made film with touching stories
I must apologize for skipping the first series in 2009 of this film before watching its sequel. Fortunately the story isn't too hard to figure out except that Quaritch the villain was in a human form in the first series. Avatar: The way of Water (2022) - what a blockbusting movie for this year, so much so that I would draw a parallel to my all time favorite The Lord of the Rings trilogy in both themes and genres.I compare Avatar to LOTR because both films are fantasy, adventure and action in genre. They are not about human stories. Yet human sentiment is intrinsically woven into the story.The storyline is simple but touching. An avatar tribe, in fact an avatar family, is fighting for its very own survival by moving to another tribe to gain their trust and help. Such story has abundant resemblance in the human world, be it refugee movement or aboriginal land rights. Yet it needs to undergo tremendous ordeals and overcome hurdles to make this happen, in which love, compassion, trust, courage, friendship and companionship definitely have played a very critical role.Fighting scene is intense, which qualifies this show as an action movie. Advanced military hardware like warplanes and whale hunting equipment and primitive tribal weapons such as arrows and spears form stark contrast between the technological gaps between two species. Yet it is smart fighting on top of hard fighting that sees the seemingly disadvantaged avatars turn the tables. All this exemplifies the superb cinematography I want to lay out next.It is not hard to figure out cinematography has everything to do with cinema by applying etymology, which in this movie simply catches your eyes, holds your breath, blows your mind, and drops your jaw. The fighting scenes, the landscape, the water thumping and particularly the underwater scenes carry great cinematic effects, so much so that I was quietly pleased to have paid a few extra dollars for a 3D upgrade. It is indeed a production that must be watched in 3D.Perhaps one of my unique likes is the depiction of avatar emotions. Their ear movements say a lot about them - upright when angry, and flopping down when sad. All carry the features of cartoon characters, which melts my heart.Acting skills have been demonstrated beyond those fighting scenes. Sam Worthington is a great action actor who has performed in multiple action movies such as Clash of the Titan (2010). There are many soft moments that guarantee a tear or two. Even when the movie was finished I could hear one of the teenage girls in the front row say ""my tears haven't dried yet."" Yes you have every reason not to come out of the cinema with dry eyes. The closing scene is particularly a good example. In flashback Jake the father and tribal leader was shedding tears when he saw his son catch a fish and the son asked him why he was crying. Oh there are many reasons for that, aren't there? Tears for victory, tears for survival, tears for loss of one son, and tears for another son's growing up, whatever it is, you name it."
"Overall feeling after watching the movie on IMAX 3D (just mentioning) - ""meh""
Lets get the obvious positives out of the way first- Technology marvel, great CG, sound track and amazing visuals. Full marks to the technicians to create the beautiful immersive environment.Far to many negatives and I am barely scratching the surface here -
1. Premise is totally absurd- the whole multi billion convoy is just out there for vengeance against Jacksully who is living his life as a family man and not looking for any trouble.2. Characters are totally formulaic/ templatized - a rebel child, a gifted adopted girl, an orphan kid, racist/ bullying teenagers etc.3. Story or the lack of it was devoid of any emotions, twist/ turns plot points4. Really long, unnecessary environment building. Probably the director got indulgent and carried awayOverall, watch it with the expectation that you are going into a 3 hour long amusement park attraction and you may have some fun. Make sure to have enough caffeine to stay awake or carry a blanket if you are need to catchup on some sleep."
"The best movie display technology I've ever seen in my life. With IMAX 3D, it has a visual that will remain on the palate. I don't think anyone other than James would make a movie with that effect again. And if the third sequel comes, we will see it again only from James. He is an artist who is very meticulous and produces magnificent works with his hard work. It hasn't sat idly for 13 years. Sequels aren't usually good. But this is different. This movie puts a thousand on it. With this production, he brought the world of cinema to the throne. It's exciting to see new things. After that we can watch different movies. For those who don't like CGI, there is no PlayStation atmosphere. Completely realistic stunning scenes. It will inspire people and add creativity to creativity. People have thoughts about the story, but full points for the visuals. I think it will still get the highest gross. Congratulations to the director and the entire team. An artistic masterpiece."
"A new generation of the Na'vi well worth the wait.Watched on a streamer but will watch again at a theatre before Xmas arrives, astounding screenplay ,phenomenally realistic effects all your favourite characters reappear in some form or another,but no plot spoilers here. There are some flashbacks to Avatar 1 in the first hour.Of course James Cameron is no stranger to underwater action, as the Abyss was a first and a Classic. He will get his money back no doubt from special edition Blu-ray or whatever for the 4k generation players.A comment on some press reviews... The current fashion underpinned by online press sales is to be contradictory to positive reviewers,let's face it, we don't all have a BA in media so what do we know?Well mr and mrs money grubbing press...guess what we were entertained by something that all good art that takes time for fruition to
happen.Hopefully the next three releases will not be as long a wait, hope to be around to see them. Tour de Force movie,take plenty of snacks."
"Seeing Avatar: The Way of Water is almost required viewing, if only for the predictably ground-breaking special FX and nostalgia of the blue people's world. If you liked the first one, you will like this one. And if there's one criticism that sticks out most to me, that is it: it caters completely and wholly to its original audience.Sure, the visuals are STUNNING. The incredible world building here is worth the price of admission, full stop. Emotionally, thematically, it feels like it fits behind the original with characters coming through as you'd hope they would. But, and this is a big ""but"", you've seen a lot of this before. Which may not be a bad thing if you want to see it all again.Beautiful new environment? Check. New creatures they must learn to bond with? Check. Even one big creature that is a defining part of the climax? Check. Bring back previous cast (even in ridiculous ways)? Check. Humans are still (mostly) greedy and stupid? Check. Political leanings all here? Anti-colonizing, eco-friendly, anti-government, anti-military, anti-fishing industry, dominant white people evil (unless they begin taking on the forms and traits of the indigenous)? Check. Some stunning action scenes? Absolutely. Did it make me cry? More than once. Did it have a heart-warming central theme? Yes.It's good. It's well made, predictable and bankable. Watch it.But...Visuals aside, it's chock full of plot oddities, retreaded material and sometimes highly stereotypical characters. The choice to use Weaver's voice for multiple characters gave an ""uncanny valley vocal"" feel to the performance, and there's not a lot of surprises (a few, yes) along the way in terms of writing and performance.I somehow felt like I was watching a 2023 remake of the original, with different environments and larger cast.There's a lot to love here. A lot to praise for a cast and production team full of ground-breaking everything. It's awesome. But it suffers from something that movies like The Matrix struggled to overcome, which is that the original was so groundbreaking, so different-mostly visually- that's it's nearly impossible to recapture that vibe in the sequel. It feels like a derivative of itself.I was happy to see them focus on family dynamics and work a little harder on character building this time out, but if you want to be truly surprised, this isn't the movie you're looking for."
"I, like many others, was skeptical about how this movie would play out considering the 13 year layoff between this movie & the first one. But from the moment this movie starts, it immediately grabs your attention and doesn't let go for well over three hours.From the plot, the story, the characters, and the overarching themes, everything worked to take you on a cinematic journey. This wasn't just some huge exposition dump either, the Way of Water took its time to explain the story and its relevance to what was happening to the Sullivan family. James Cameron did an amazing job of balancing fierce action with mundane and intimate moments that made this movie come together in a way that made sense. You learned to care for all the characters and understand, if not agree, with the decisions that they made through the story.The world of Pandora continues to be a visual delight to behold. At times I felt as if I was watching a documentary from National Geographic with just how breathtaking the shots of the animals and the environments were. Marvel should take notes, this film was a master class in how CGI can be used to enhance a story rather than be something that's distracting. The integration between the live action actors and the CGI characters were flawless and it felt as if the characters themselves were actual people rather than computer renderings.My only gripe was the fact that in some spaces certain scenes weren't allowed to breathe. For instance, something would happen, and the characters would only have a brief moment to reflect on what occurred before moving onto the next scene. I think that had a lot to do with James Cameron editing this movie in a way to accommodate the attention span of general audiences. However, I, at no point, felt as if I was watching a three hour movie unlike so many other movies that have come out in recent years that felt like complete chores to get through.All in all, this was a fascinating story, and one that I am invested in seeing play out over the next 3 to 4 films. If you're looking for a visual delight, an amazing story, and relatable characters, then this is a film that you should definitely check out."
"As many other reviewers stated, the movie is quite a letdown in terms of story, but it doesn't really succeed on other aspects either. Visually is fine, but that we already expected, since the first Avatar offered us already everything this one does, so it doesn't really surprises the viewer anymore, let alone blow their mind like the first one did. Even on the big screen, in 3D, it simply doesn't have the ""wow"" factor.Other (negative) aspects:
Large parts of the movie feel a like a documentary, which would be fine...if I wanted to watch David Attenborough: Another Blue Planet, but that's not what I wanted
The action parts are not emotional enough, the fight I ended up caring the most about, was between a ""whale"" and a crew of fishermen. That says a lot about the rest of the clashes between main characters.Speaking of characters, the ones we cared about in the first installment have less screen time and overall weight in the movie
Very basic dialogue, overly simplistic lines, no memorable quotes, overuse of that annoying ""bro"" appellativeConclusion: Nothing really worked as it should have, full of flaws on most aspects, the pretty visuals just not enough to save the rest..."
"When i entered in theatre my expectations was too high for this movie.After 13 Years We are going to watch Next Avatar Movie,
Okay Let's Start My Personal Opinion about this movie.1- Don't Expect too much about Storyline
2- Avatar 2 is Visually Good movie ( Not Great )
I got same vibe as Avatar (2009)
3- Storyline has too many holes and sometimes boring
4- Music was Good But Not Great
5- 3D Gives you better experience
6- Water shots was amazing
7- Climax fight was silly (Not So Impressed)
Overall It's a one time watch movie.**Remember It's my personal opinion.I'm not saying this a bad movie but i expected too much."
"The following review is a short summary of my observation based on story, character depth and dialogue.After watching an hour and a half of an underwater documentary of Pandora and its magnificent fish with special effects we were full. Once we'd gotten enough visual effects for the day we were left with bad dialogue and template storylines mashed together in a weird, off-putting way.The movie tried to tell me a story but didn't know where to begin, where to take me and how to take me there so it panicked and just threw some random scenes at my face, and when that failed, it kept buying time with special effects and wonderful nature panorama...
It was like we're building up to something, we're not excited about it because it's incredibly predictable, and there is a good chance it may never come because it's already been 2 hours...There is no build up to the emotional bonds between characters so they seem very unrealistic. There are unnecessary characters that add no value and they are intolerable. The dialogue just kept getting worse and worse to the point where we watched a woman chatting with mother whale about their children, and the whale was asking 'how is your baby doing?' or something. This was the moment we decided to leave the theatre to save the rest of our evening."
"Was it worth the hype? I say yeah. Now I will say this off the bat, it's not a perfect movie but it's not bad at all. People giving it a 3 or 4 I can't agree with that score for this. A lot of people were saying this was better than the original and I personally agree. I think this was an improvement over the first and I was shocked at how incredible the cgi was. I shouldn't be but James Cameron and his crew always creates beautiful cgi amd scenery, It's genuinely incredible how good it is. Now let's get into the plot.It's been over 10-15 years I believe since the humans left pandora and now they have returned to kill Jake sully. Now Jake sully is the leader of the Omatikaya na'vi and has a family now to care for, so when they attack him they leave the Omatikaya clan and go into hiding with the water tribe na'vi. He and his family have to learn and adapt to the changes and the ways of the water while the RDA and the rest of the humans chase down sully. I won't go into to much detail because a lot of it if it can go into spoiler territory. Like seriously a lot happens in this movie. It was a very enjoyable movie and it felt shorter than 3 hours while watching it. The action and cinematics are insanely good. The actings good. But the story is the same through out and it doesn't really twist or change like the original. Though I do feel this movie was better than the first I still think both story's are decent Great moments aside. Definitely an enjoyable movie that's worth seeing. It's not the best movie of 2022 but it's still quite good and worth the watch. I'm really excited for the third movie of the series in 2024."
"James Cameron doesn't fails to amaze. Have been a fan since I saw Alien, he has only improved. I thought Avatar was the epitome, but in Avatar 2, he has created a whole new world of water which is simply breathtaking. The sea creatures are literally out of this world ;). The adaptations in the inhabitants due to living in water is minutely created.Contrary to what I had heard, the story has progressed very logically. There are dull moments when the flora and fauna are shown, but they only facilitate the narration. Emotions run high, specially towards the end.James Cameron gives us lessons in family values, forest conservation, water conservation and love for nature, sugar-coated in top quality production values.NOT TO BE MISSED AT ANY COST."
"James Cameron is amazing at creating characters and the world around them. He takes an unbelivable amount of time to show us the sons and daughters of Jake, their problems, their relations, their experiences. Love it. I enjoyed the dynamic of the familiy.The ocean is as great as the woods in the first film. The visuals are stunning, I liked the 3D. I felt a great need to learn more about the world and get deeper in it.Problem: The story. In my opinion, the basic conflict with the essential moments don't differ enough from the first part. The bad guys are more or less the same, the motivation is basically the same as well as the key moments resulting from it. I was emotionally not as much involved as in the first part. This resulted in less suspense and not so strong emotions. I'm really sad about that because it weakens the strong aspects i mentioned earlier. In the end, it feels like the weak story doesn't do the great world justice Still, a great piece of art and very enjoyable. I'm looking forward to part three."
"The followup of Avatar is as beautiful GFX can go but with a ""blend"" story. Too many children in the Sully family gives too less depth in the characters yet they tried and it became too much with no success. And speaking of characters I must mention the young human they call ""Spider"" that hangs out with the avatars. He should simply not be in the movie at all. Hes anoying in his breathing mask, minimal outfit and warpaint running around acting and thinking hes a Navi. Pathetic, truly.The story have we all seen before.A chased family takes refuge with another ""clan"" and the threat they are fleeing from eventually caught up with them and everyone gets involved and drag into the conflict. Good vs evil with some losses and grief that comes from war.Nothing special. Its worth a watch but if this would have been a streaming product for home i would have fast scrolled a good portion because the lack of stimulation and long slow sections of ""bla bla"".The first movie was truly awsome. The sequal was ""meh""."
"Avatar , The way of disappointment.Long awaited disappointment not only too long screen time. It seems some National geographic or Animal planet show and sometimes i feel like why this is happening and why am i supposed to watch that!Over hype , best Director , highest budget can not make a movie good .After watching i didn't find any good reason to make this sequel without a good story.Please wake up Mr. Cameron. We don't have any interest for any other Avatar series .Please show your brilliance with any other good story and screenplay . We are eagerly waiting for another masterpiece from you."
"So, overall pretty enjoyable but way too long. Given the amount of money spent on it, it achieved the tricky task of actually looking cheap at times. This was down to the switching between digital and film media. It made it very disconcerting to watch, like we were watching two completely different films that had been crudely stitched together. Maybe that had something to do with us watching the 2D version? It felt like we were watching a 3D film that had been reverse rendered for 2D - all a bit weird. It's a film that's very pleased with itself - of course it looks beautiful but the aesthetic definitely dominated the story-telling. First hour could have been done in 15 mins - we get it. They're happy then they have to flee to protect their people. The happiness doesn't need an hour to lock-in. Cameron needed a strong presence alongside him to force a tighter edit."
"Awesome movie. Actors did a fantastic job. He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2: ~ The story is paper-thin. It's a visual treat to watch the movie in cinema halls."
"I don't know about you guys but I'm not impressed with the visual part of the movie. Can't stop thinking about very bad 3D execution. First one was so much better, more depth overall, things were in front of my eyes and I was in awe. This part was like I'm watching some Avengers stuff that was converted into 3D, no real depth, no anything that is coming out of screen. I remember that first Avatar was filmed with 3D camera wich made movie most expensive ever, this one was obviously not. So disappointed, it could have been great movie but it's not. And that leads us to the story. It's ok, average, but that's it."
"Visually beautiful. Entertaining. The CG guys did a great work as usual. But!The storyline is so poor, so predictable. It has clearly a catch-all side. The plot is simple... The characters are the same, they are very archetypal... You can see clearly that James Cameron used some old ideas in his past movies.A 2 hours movie would have been better fo that kind of scenario.Also we are in 2022, the first movie was made in 2009. At this time it was a big revolution visually speaking, but now? I mean, there is no surprise. I'm not impressed by the CG now... I was waiting for a more complex storyline for the second movie.Also this is my point of view, I think this movie is overrated because of the media attention to James Cameron movies."
"With all the half-assed social critic films, one lifeless biopic after another, and remakes that literally has nothing but a resounding name, I admit, seeing avatar 2 brings more horror than joy, then the horror thickens when I see 345 are already on schedule. Recently seeing movies just seems more bother than enjoyment, I was ready to score some punchlines and get through the excruciating and mind numbingly long film and call it a day,
BUT GOOD GRAVY Cameron, you beautiful b*****d, you proved me wrong, you wisked me away to the vivaciouw world of Pandora, and remembered me the long forgotten reasons that got me excited to see a movie. Thanks Cameron, you revived something I thought that was long gone in me."
"Honestly??? 7.5/10The first one? 6.5/10 (might watch again)The GOOD...
-obviously it's pretty. Matter of fact, it's clear that's what they are showing off.-when the action finaallyyy begins, it's pretty cool.- those two things alone were enough for a good movie experience.The BAD and annoying.KIDS!!! How many mistakes and bad decisions do we need to see to know they are stupid? We get it. It was frustrating.STORY or lack there of. Nothing special. Bad guy is mad and looking for good guys. That's it. That's the story.This whole plot moves forward because of stupid children. More questions than answers, and clearly just one incredibly long episode setting up the next incredibly long episode. Blah.In the end... it's a pretty big reminder of how Sh!tty humans are."
"-Some cons:
Weak story-expected plot. After the 1st hour, it was obvious that the next 2 hours of the movie will follow a certain pattern.Spent time with pointless dialogues. It felt like that more work is needed with the characters.Not a solid movie. Part of it was like watching a documentary and part of it like a Disney movie -Nemo.-And pros:
Beautiful cinematography
Fantastic scenes
Worth the time spentIn the bottom line, it was an Epic movie and an excellent job made by scratch. But remember, it is the unexpected that keep you hooked on the silver screen. I will think a lot before visiting a theater for the next episode if the story remains excepted and so childish. An epic movie also needs a strong story to be great."
"This was the longest three hours I ever spent in a cinema where nothing conclusive or concrete happens in a movie. It's just loads of great CGI etc but where the effects triumphed, the story lacked. This movie could have been condensed to 1 hour and they could have given us a final ending in the next 2 hours.Instead they chose the drag out everything so long, that I feel asleep a couple of times during the movie and each time I woke up, the story had not developed and I had missed nothing.If you need an excuse to be absent from somewhere for 3 hours or you want to sleep, then go watch it, otherwise just go to Wikipedia to read the summary and wait for the next part as this one was left on an unsatisfying cliffhanger. Too much time was spent between this part and the first part, at least the first part had a great story. This was just a cash grab so they can now start production on a third part."
"Worst movie from this year, and I also seen Amsetrdam. It is hard to believe that a movie with such a great reputation could end up like this. The story, the dialogue, the action are so weak that I wanted to leave the cinema room after one hour. It's a movie without begining and without end. Not even emotional, how they wanted to be. The sends to Iona and Moby Dick are also pathetic, even thouth both stories are such good. It's like an unfurtonate combination between ""Hard to kill, Kill Bill, Titanic and a documentary from discovery. I am truly disappointed mostly because here have such a great score."
"I see other people say this movie didn't have enough of a plot. I could see that being true in the overall forest sense. But in the tree sense, there was a plot.It seems this movie chose to focus on relationship and interactions. It's as if you erased the avatar aspect of the movie, you'd be watching an episode of full house, step by step, family ties, etc.I think they'll could have fixed the large forest problem in the plot of they made it so that they were trying to take down Jake Sully for a better reason. Like he had was trying to lead the resistance, he knew too much, so they need to get rid of him for safety. Then, there should be plots of them organizing to fight a resistance. Instead, to the plot seemed more trivial. If they created a letter of the resistance needs to be killed plot like in Terminator 2, that would have easily fixed the plot... The forest plot... To be less simple.Now the tree plot.... If you erased the cool avatar aspect of it.... It feels like a bad episode of boy meets world it something.I was afraid of watching such a long movie. However, the movie didn't feel long. It felt like I was chilling at home(I saw this on the theater) and watched 4 or 5 different TV shows.I felt chill... First, I watched an episode of M*A*S*H, (which I did not sign up for!!!), (MASH is a sitcom about soldiers in the Korean war? Maybe Vietnam war.) I didn't like MASH, so I'm glad I next felt like I was watching an episode of Step by Step. Then, an episode Sea Quest, Save Willy, then an episode of Titanic... though that's not a show...Having so many transitions made the movie not feel long. It was good.I thought it would be gross to see mostly naked creatures. I thought they'd be ugly. But, in the movie, these creatures were really pretty and nice to look at.They are better looking than humans. I wish we were cuter. Oh well.I'm really jealous of these creatures. The weather on their planet Pandora is so nice. They can be outdoors in great beauty all the time. Have creatures to fly around or swim around on. I wish we lived like them.I'm bothered by how they portrayed the humans as so evil. It was a bit over the top. Maybe some are that evil, but they were acting official... So, I don't know.Cultural appropriation? I don't know."
This movie is an emotion. I just love Avatar The Way Of Water. Trust me you won't disappoint. I just want to thank the director of this movie James Cameron. He is genius. VFX is awesome of this movie . I recommend to watch this movie in a big screen otherwise you will miss the real tase of this movie.This movie is an emotion. I just love Avatar The Way Of Water.

"This is a sequel that was made right! Just a great motion picture that sets a example to how sequels should be. Didn't over due it on anything kept the feelings real and didn't loose them in the graphics or boring storyline telling. Action packed and heart felt moments that make a movie great!! Hats off to the director and everyone in on another great film! If you loved the first Avatar movie this is an awesome follow up on the ""Sullys"" next chapter in life! Let me just say family is everything and this sequel revolves and grows from what family goes through! If you miss this in the big screen you'll regret it!"
"I'm one of the people who complained that James Cameron was taking far too long to make this movie. I'm also someone who was adamant about the fact that the first Avatar didn't need a sequel because it was a complete story on its own. However, although The Way of Water isn't as good as the first film, it was worth the wait.Sam Worthington and Stephan Lang stole almost every scene they had as Jake Sully and Miles Quaritch respectively. Their hero and villain chemistry was excellent, mostly done through audio communication until they finally met face to face, at which point the testosterone levels went through the roof. One can tell that Jake and Quaritch despise each other, yet also have an unspoken mutual respect that any true warrior would feel towards a worthy opponent.Zoe Saldana's ability to switch between Neytiri howling with grief to a deadly warrior in full murder mode was chilling. To avoid spoilers, I won't say why she was grieving but it's the most heartbreaking moment in the movie and the only time where one of Sam Worthington's co-stars actually managed to steal a scene from him.Sigourney Weaver was in a unique situation, being the only onscreen performer in history to play a teenager whilst in her seventies. The decision to have her play Kiri could have backfired because although the CGI was able to flawlessly hide Sigourney's real age, many people in her situation would still have the body language of an old person. Watch Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci in The Irishman if you want to see how CGI can't hide the fact that they're unable to move as easily as they once could. Fortunately, Sigourney still has an extraordinary amount of physical strength and agility, so whenever she's moving, she does it in a way that looks as effortless as it would be for an actual teenager. My only criticism of her performance is a few line deliveries.At it's core, this is a movie about family. However, there's more going on in the script than there was in the first Avatar, which had a very simple script. I'm not one of those pretentious idiots who thinks that a script needs to be complex in order to be good which is why I consider the first film to be a masterpiece. The Way of Water doesn't reach masterpiece status because this story has so much happening that it causes a few pacing issues. At one point in the finale, there was so much time spent on action that I completely forgot some characters were still struggling to survive underwater at the same time. Furthermore, unlike the first Avatar, there are loose ends that need to be tied up which makes another Sequel a requirement in order to finish the story."
"Sorry to say - Nothing new here - too much livestyle (help a Planet - be part of the nature) a la Mainstream media. These larger smurfs Look More and more Strange. And on top of that no Twists in the Plot just heavy gunfire :-( no storyline - Hard to Imagine that There are More Parts to come. CGI was Nothing new and More Boring than awaited. A second Part is always Hard to deliver - but possible to Top the Premiere Part. Why does it always seem that Star Wars was the blueprint for those Movies Like that. Will
Watch Part 3 but Not at a Cinema. Watch This Part 2 at Home - no Theatre needed This Time."
"I really enjoyed the first Avatar. I saw it in IMAX 3D and found it visually stunning. I was excited to see this one, even with the daunting duration of over 3 hours. Within the first 30 minutes, I would have walked out if there hadn't been so many people sitting in my row. The story was blah, the visuals were not as stunning as the first one, and the acting was weak. There were people who just disappeared from the story and plot lines that didn't add anything but were fillers. No need for big name actors, you can't recognize anyone (plus everyone looks very similar). Scenes stolen from Jurassic Park, Jaws, and many other similar movies. The whole thing could have been wrapped up in 45 minutes to an hour.."
"Ju st watched in in cinema 3D like it was made to be watched, but I was dissapointed, The technology is still the same, I was expecting to be immersed like any other movie to date but it was still the same 3D its always been. Plotwise same as first movie, slightly better.They really nailed the realism of aliens however on the big screen you can see that with all that money they still didn't have enough because surprisingly some details where cut, the mechs and vehicles in high pace action bits looked very plastic and toy like, that pulled me out of the immersion. This movie had a lot of good acting and rich characters. Too bad the whole movie wasn't like the ending, because that's where I really got hooked."
"The most expensive 3D film ever made to date. Not about hostile 'Aliens' but about Jake Sully finding peaceful tree dwellers on planet Pandora, living in a beautiful rain forest that looked like our Amazon. In Avatar 1, their home was ravaged by greedy, ruthless, white men from the 'Star' i.e. Earth (American raiders), armed with machine guns and missiles, hunting down tribes armed with spears, bows and arrows. Avatar 2 is about saving Pandora's Ocean creatures and islanders, as the Sully family seek refuge by the great ocean. Learning the Way of the Water. The ocean creatures look like a giant killer whale (befriended by son Lo'ak Sully), stunningly beautiful luminous sea anemone, jellyfish, starfish, glofishes and flying fishes!Of course, soon the baddies are out to kill all, while the 'whale' seeks revenge for its family wiped out by these people. Sadly the story reminded me of another intelligent killer whale story called the 'Orca' (1977). I give the story 6/10 ratings. VFX 3D effects, sets and photography 9/10. Average 7.5/10. Watch this on the big screen to see a giant whale leaping out of the screen and crashing down! In real life, whales are also killed with explosive harpoons and their oil was used in cosmetics (now banned). David Attenborough would love this movie. Save our planet from extinction."
"This long awaited movie has been on the watch list of every 90s and 2000s kid who has seen the 1st one in theatres/3d and fell in love with it!Such an amazing way to bring back memories of Pandora, and nothing best than to enjoy those memories in IMAX. Eywa has definitely blessed us with the direction of James Cameron.The only problem was the extensively long runtime of 3 Hrs 13 Min and the sub par storyline. I mean its like watching Avatar 1 with different characters and settings; The reason for skypeople to come to Pandora, the random I see you, the chasing scene with the sea predator, and a lot of other scenes feel like dejá vu.All in all, it's a must watch movie for Avatar 1 fans as well as people who love a little bit of action, drama and visuals. IMAX 3D is a must if you wanna watch this and feel good about it. The dialogues are great though, and the dialogue delivery is even more excellent."
"Rating it 10/10 stars easily, thank you James Cameron and the cast and crew for bringing us back to Pandora and introducing us to the Sully family. I'm a huge fan of Avatar, easily my favourite movie of all time. Avatar: The Way Of Water is Such a beautiful movie and truly a magical experience to watch it in 3D. I thought the storyline was very emotional full of happiness, adventure, tragedies and perils. As Jake Sully puts it ""Outstanding"". Don't let the long run time scare you, it felt like the shortest 3 hours of my life and had me wanting to watch more and more. Be prepared to shed some tears."
"I'm indifferent to the first movie but the pacing was undoubtedly superior. This movie had some amazing, bordering on genius ideas, that can't be denied. But the scenes where the movie became a nature documentary fell into the trap of presenting as pretentious and dragged out far too long. By the end of the movie you feel like the movie could well have been several hours longer than it actually was. It was well worth the price of admission for its technical achievements. In my case I do not think I could bring myself to experience the movie again which is a real shame, it has an awful lot of promise."
"Here we are eventually Avatar2 and certainly living up to excitement and expectations. Hats off to James Cameron for the visual treat and giving attention to details.The story is rightly extended though little predictable and stretched at times but it keeps you hooked right throughout. The kids part is engaging and heart touching special Graces daughter and they way she controls sea life.Kate Winslet screentime is limited, bet it would be extended in next sequels and her to be born kid with seemingly wonder powers. Watch it and immerse in the world of Pandora once again though I still need to watch in 4dx to fully enthrall the experience."
"I watched Avatar TWOW on iMax 3D HFR.The whole experience is enhanced by the high frame rate. It is like in the movie Arrival, where the linguist woman is watching the aliens through the looking glass.The pacing of the movie is great. Three hours passed by fast.The water sequences of the movie are ASTOUNDING. At some point, it feels like you are watching a Documentary about the Navi and not a Movie! The HFR really sells it!The new characters are very endearing. I wish they talked more about Ewa, but I guess that will be revealed in Avatar 3.The special effects are literally lifelike. We have reached photo-realism. It is a Sight to Behold! Worth the admission ticket.I got to take peek at Pandora tonight!I will be dreaming of Kiri!"
"I honestly think that like in the first movie , the images are stunning and beautiful , i can't even describe what it really transmits to me .Avatar was and it is a childhood movie , so seeing Jake and Neytiri becoming parents it was just heart-warming , this movie was beyond my expectations, i would also not say that it was the top and that was better than the first one.In both movies the image is wonderful but the plot i feel like James Cameron hasn't give much importance to it , and he clearly wants to show us Pandora as a planet and all the creatures, fauna and flora that live in it , such are importante for sure , but with a stronger plot it would have been more powerful.I really enjoy Kiri's character , so different , so special and definitely so mysterious, i felt so similar to her , the fact that she felt different , not like everyone else , i just loved that.I do not say that it was a wonderful movie tough , but i know that James Cameron has huge plans for
the other 3 movies.Also there are lots of parallel scenes between the first and the second movie , that i didn't mind at all , in fact i did enjoy that the kids of Jake and Neytiri were experiencing a similar situation as Jake did in the first movie , maybe for some people did bother this , because represent a repetition , but instead i feel like it is a sort of connection between the movies."
"Like a Marvel movie but on steroids. It hurt to watch. SO American, glorification of violence and hypermasculinity, traditional family values. 3 hours of pure torture and irritation. Characters that lack depth and make dumb choices. Seriously, why did Spider save his dad at the end? When this guy literally killed his friend and almost every person he grew up with? JUST because it's his biological father? It's so stupid. Also Jake is an annoying dad who raises his family like a military commander and treats his wife like she's dumb while SHE is the only true native Na'Vi in the family. But apparently the father knows better.I gave it 2 points for the visuals. Cause that's the only thing this movie has going for it."
"I cannot believe it has been 13 years since we all saw Avatar in theaters. Not to mention, 25 years since we saw Titanic in theaters!It's become a trend to hate on Avatar since its blockbuster release. But I loved the film in theaters back then and the many times I have seen it at home it still holds up. For me the first Avatar is one of the best Scf-Fi movies ever made.So, the sequel of the BEST 3D movie ever is here and I just had to check it out in Imax 3D. No other format can do this film justice.James Cameron is an amazing director. He has made 7 straight block busters in his career. This is his 8th one. This movie deals with what Jake Sully and his expanded family are doing on Pandora as the people from Earth are back in huge forces.The story of the film is a bit generic as was the case with the previous film. I think the director has decided that the visual awe and spectacle of these film must come to the forefront and hence he keeps making the plots extremely simple and easy to follow. Its not like Cameron doesn't make complicated plotted films, but Avatar 1 and 2 both are not that. So don't go in expecting twists and turns and mind-bending plot devices. This is not a Nolan film. Some plot devices and points of the first film are re-used in some manner in this one and it doesn't feel repetitive as its not happening to the same characters but it does all too familiar at times.Instead, this movie is a visual spectacle. I challenge anyone to show a movie better made in the VFX department. The VFX is so good that its very easy to forget that every frame is CGI. The underwater scenes look like they were shot on location. Even the mechs and other technology look absolutely real. This is not a film that can be fully enjoyed at home. Anyone trying to catch it on OTT on their mobile is missing 90% of the films impact. So, this movie is a theatrical experience. Everyone was worried that Marvel movies have raised people's bar for VFX or that VFX have become too common now so people might not enjoy this film. But the breathtaking level of CGI in this film is like nothing that has been seen on screen before. But to see the DETAILS you have to see it on a huge screen.The acting is motion captured so to have bad performances would be really difficult. Still Neytiri comes across as a bit hysterical and high strung as compared to every other Na'vi and Human character including her children. But then she was like that in the previous film too.The cinematography (though wholly digital) has to be seen to be believed. The shots are kept simple and there is not much of camera movements or nauseating Shakey camera moments. There are moments where you will feel like you are actually underwater and swimming. I typically HATE underwater films like Aquaman or Waterworld which come across and boring and tedious, but not this film. The underwater scenes are really well done. Plus the action underwater is swift yet clearly visible. It doesn't become a visual mess like Aquaman. The scenes feel like they are really shot with blue Na'vi actors in some real ocean.The music is adequate but none of the main themes really stuck out to me. But it gets the job done. James Horner the previous music director of the first part has tragically passed away. He will be missed sorely.Overall : This is a must must watch in theaters. Make sure you have a clean 3D glass and the theater you visit has a good brightness. Seeing this at home is pointless.Rating : 8/10. I frankly enjoyed the first one a lot more. This part 2 is visually amazing, but I feel the next two sequels might make me reconsider the rating of this film. Even though the story is complete and there is no cliff hanger moment, it does feel a bit incomplete. Its how Empire Strikes Back felt a bit hollow till the next part came out. So I liked the first one more than this one, but this still is a really good film with some great action moments."
"I watched the movie once and I have never been so hopeful and disappointed in a movie in my life. The movie was primarily a visual feast. But first of all, towards the end of the movie, when Jake Sully and the water clan attack the Colonel and his crew, the entire clan suddenly disappears. I don't understand why the clan suddenly dropped everything and disappeared even though the clan chief's daughter was in enemy territory. Jake and his family struggle alone.Secondly, we see the tradition of resurrecting the dead in amateur films in this film as well. I think they sent the colonel back as an avatar. And as if the Colonel himself wasn't enough, he also had a son. Third, Big Jake, Toruk Macto and ex-soldiers can't hold their breath underwater, come on, it doesn't matter. When the forest was much safer, Jake's son, who left his clan for his family and chose the water route with a ridiculous excuse, dies and when the colonel's son comes to him, he says ""son instead of son"". We saw the tradition of resurrecting the half-dead for the first time in this movie. Grace is dead, get it, leave this woman alone. Also, as you'll remember from Jurassic Word 2, it wouldn't surprise me if Kiri is the child of the sacred tree Ewa or a similar connection in future movies, as women can get pregnant on their own. I can't watch avatar 1, which I watched 6 times, because of this disappointment. I hope James Cameron removes this movie completely and remakes it."
"Many years in the making I set the bar high. Having so much time invested in a film had me ready to implode. Like the first I was blown away, great story writing, I felt so close to these new characters each had plenty of screen time to learn and really feel for them. Bringing these characters together showed great power and revealed an excellent moral as a story.For a CGI movie I felt like I was there and I could embrace the world and the new scenery that was created. Attention do detail was high and purely enjoyable through the adventure. Hard to fault, easy to fall in love with. I will be watching this again.For me a truly emotional ride, as I'm left satisfied with this master piece."
"I was waiting for this movie so many years. The result was a masterpiece. This movie simply changed the whole cinema, gave to the other producers reason to make steps forward. Goosebumps in every scene, I was so happy to see the sequel. Just a masterpiece. The CGIS were the best CGIS you have ever seen. The scenario is very good. The characters are very good placed in the movie. The planet of Pandora is magical. So many details and vibes. Every animal is different and so unique. Every character was so exceptional. I saw it in IMAX 3D. Perfect experience. Can't wait to see the the next movies.If someone didn't see the movie, just go to the cinema."
"You need to watch in Imax theatre. Its like experiencing a new life new species. If you are animal lover, ramily rooted, explorer, adventurer and into sci-fii movie then this movie is created just for you. This movie is ahead of its time. It should have made in 2050. I never felt like its 3 hours movie and my heart keeps on asking more and more. I would recommend to watch it in 2d becoz I feel like 3D glasses will de-saturate the movie. Its like watching life of pie whale scene for 3 hours. Its just spactacular!Dont wait for for it to come on ott platform becoz it wont give you the experience that you will get on Imax."
I watched Avatar the way of water in imax and it is totally worth it. The movie is more than three hours but I did not feel like it is that long because the whole time I was enjoying every frame of the movie.I love that the story is simple and with no bloaters or additional complications. I was surprised Kate winslet is one of the main casts. The acting are all excellent even if they are on 3d. Bravo to Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana for excellent acting.I am glad we are seeing other regions of Pandora and new tribes and culture. The ocean scenes are marvelous. Probably the most advanced movie special effects right now.
"PROS:-The strong family values presented. Hollywood has long forgotten how to write a real family.-The visuals, particularly the water environments and bioluminescence are stunning.-The characters are all well defined and all of the children were portrayed honestly.-Kiri is clearly being set up to be the Jesus of Pandora.-The creature designs are a sight to behold.-The entire 3rd act was thrilling, despite it being a Titanic throwback.CONS:-The 3-D was distracting from the visuals! I'll never subject my eyes to 3-D again!-The runtime. Definitely could've used another edit.I'll be honest, I'm not a fan of the first Avatar and the trailers for this didn't do much for me. I went into this not expecting much, so I'm quite surprised by how much I enjoyed this. The plot is nothing to write home about, but the execution is. Hollywood has long forgotten how to write strong family dynamics, so that being a strong focus was a real selling point. Every character is made unique despite them all looking blue, Kiri being the standout. The creature designs are amazing and the bonds between the whales and the Navi was a big highlight. The visuals, especially the bioluminescence sequences are beautifully imagined. The villain being out a simple revenge story worked well here. Hollywood could benefit from injecting simplicity back into their scripts! Cameron still knows how to do action unlike anyone else, even if the end was a throwback to Titanic. Overall, I was surprised by this film, and I look forward to seeing it again without the 3-D."
"I'm not going to start this review like everyone else's because it's redundant. This is a review coming from one of James Cameron's biggest fans. And I have to say, it's weird not knowing how I feel about a James Cameron film when my entire film school journey has been me solely idolizing his craft and declaring him to be superior to Spielberg and Scorsese to a room full of film snobs at Columbia College.I saw the first Avatar over five times in theater. I own three different versions of the film (the bare bones version that was released), the special edition, and then the 3D version. I have all the toys from the first film, still factory sealed because I believed this was the future of franchise films. So, I was more than ready for Avatar: The Way of Water. Almost too ready, so I tampered my expectations.At this point, saying that Avatar: The Way of Water is a technological masterpiece is like constantly saying Jordan is the greatest NBA player ever. Everyone gets that. So, on pure visual spectacle, James Cameron proves once again that no one is on his level. You will find yourself in awe of the hair fibers on someone's arms. When it comes to action scenes, no one frames shots better or knows how to exploit the full width of the frame to tell an amazing visual story. This film is the standard for CGI.But what matters, at the end of the day, is story. And this is where Avatar: The Way of Water falls flat. It's Dances With Wolves, and it feels just as dated. The performances never feel like the actors created a new culture to explore, they feel like actors imagining what it would be like to be Native American and it feels weird at times. Fresh off the heels of Wakanda Forever's deep cultural dive, this feels dated by comparison. This film also exhausts too many moments showing off how awesome the CGI is in multiple scenes where the characters marvel at the world they live in. When you already live on the most beautiful planet in the world, it's fascinating to see the Na'vi still in awe. But in fairness, we live on a beautiful planet and we're still in awe at times too.I say all of that to say, this is not a bad film. This is a film worth seeing in theaters. This is a film I'm grateful for because it advances the medium light years ahead in only the way James Cameron can. But for the first time in my 30+ years of James Cameron fandom, I found myself wishing my favorite director/writer had let someone else write the story because this is a franchise that can be so much more than what was given. And perhaps in the sequels, it will prove to be just that. But for now, this film proves what we already knew about James Cameron and also reveals that his style of storytelling is not as timeless as I would want it to be."
"The most highly anticipated sequel of 2022 finally lands in theatres - and you'll need to watch it there, to get Cameron's intent.On the one hand, this is one of the most stunning visual and sound experiences (especially in IMAX 3D) ever put to film. It's Immersive in a way that very few films could even begin to replicate. That alone makes it worth the trip to see, at least once.However, you sadly realise after coming out that, while exhilarating often in the moment (the near 3hr 15min runtime rushes by pretty briskly, surprisingly enough) the film sometimes may not add up to more than the sum of its parts at times.First, the 'revenge and hunt' plot and story, like in the first Avatar, are basic. It services the visuals, rather than the other way around.Second: speaking of which, sumptuous as those visuals often are, they don't unfortunately stay around long enough for more than a few frames each, before rushing to the next one. Pacing could have been with being relaxed and slower a lot more, to really soak up what's on screen in certain moments. 'Less, but longer exposure, is more' might have been advised.Third: as other important flaws: I would have rather to be honest they let Quaritch keep the two arrows in his chest and dead forever, and not be a resurrected Avatar. We missed opportunities to see his character grow - even after finding he has a son - as he essentially plays the same character as in the first movie.Fourth: for new characters, Edie Falco and Jermaine Clement both could be taken out with little repercussions, and Giovanni Ribisi's 'reapperance' likewise. This missed an opportunity to take Avatar in a new direction, away from the 'sky people', and more into Pandora itself, which would possibly have been more interesting.To come back at the end to a few character pluses though: the links to Sigourney Weaver's character in the first film of a new character here are intriguing, if a little underdeveloped. This is obviously going to be expanded more in futher sequels though, so I'm not going to bulldoze them here. Some tender teen and family moments also appreciated which, if a little sacharrin and stereotypical at times, weren't totally overplayed either.In all then: while plenty of flaws (that we have to hope that Avatar 3 gets to grips with) - for those of you enjoying pure visual spectacle, this is the best to date you'll see.I would watch this again, although perhaps not at a premium theatre price for second entry."
"The story is really, really awful, which is disappointing because it kind of destroys the amazing scenery and the incredible world Cameron created with Pandora.The story is not creative, its not coherent and its not interesting. The bad guy from part 1 (i dont even remember his name) gets recycled and wants to take revenge on jake. Doing that he captures his children several times and each time they manage to either free themselves or get freed. The bad guy kinda has a son who doesnt like him because hes so bad, but the son still saves his fathers life in the end of the movie which is unlucky because now well have to see him again in part3. During the third part there is a dramatic scene on a sinking ship, which weirdly reminds of Titanic, but is not really sound, because the Navy just learned how to dive really long and do it for way longer time for fun and suddenly its a huge issue.Only very few characters develop real depth, most stay superficial. The bad guy for example has nothing that makes him interesting. Hes just bad and thats it. Thats the biggest problem of the movie - they just missed the chance to create an interesting plot to place their world on. Thats why i think if they continue like this there will never be an Avatar legacy like other great Fantasy or SciFi universes have it. Which I find sad, because i really like the Navy and their world - i watched the first movie twice in theater. But there are to little characters and to little depth in them.Obviously the good part about the movie are the amazing pictures. Its just astonishing and fun to watch. The best parts where the ones just showing the characters swimming around in the nature and exploring the seas. Also the first whale hunting was interesting to watch - altough again not really connected to the rest of the story.So yeah, overall great pictures that cant make up for the really disappointing story."
"My actual rating is a 3.75. I enjoyed the visual effects and the dynamic water tribe and reef. That was it. It was absolutely not worth watching the movie for.I don't normally do movie reviews and have never done one on IMDb, but I feel the current IMDb rating of 8.1 is so incorrect I must leave my experience.The acting and the writing failed to draw the audience in - the back stories did not succeed in being interesting (like Spyder and his Avatar dad, and Sully's son and his whale-like friend).If you are going to have a movie be over 3 hours (really even over 2 hours) please make the storyline interesting. I enjoyed watching the Sully childrens' experiences in the reef and seeing the vivid underwater life in the movie, but the entire movie could have been less than two hours. There were needless action scenes and many cliches played out. I normally get fairly attached to characters, but I actually laughed out loud when an important character died, due to the movie going on way too long and the lack of emotional depth of the scene.After about two hours I didn't care what happened to any of them, I just wanted it to be over.TLDR: 3 stars (3.75 IMDb rating in my opinion) due to wonderful visuals and intricate details of Avatar world. This was only redeeming factor, and not worth watching. Writing this review because I have absolutely no idea how it has 8+ score on IMBd.Save your money and time, don't go."
"Avatar The Way Of Water Of Water is a movie 12 years in the making,and boy does it pay off. This movie is an achievment in cgi. I would not be suprised if the government came out and told us that they were real. This movie takes us to a new area of pandora, the sea. The effects of the water need to be awknolaged here just amazing. Storywise the movie is very simple but somehow that is what makes it standout in the movie. There a lot of new characters in this movie, which i will not spoil here. But for the most part there great some outshine theain charectera from the last movie. But the film is veey long and the length can be felt, but that is more of a nitpick than a critisism. This movie is definitaley better than the first one. A movie you should see specifaccly in the theater."
"I'm not sure where everyone else stands on why they didn't like the plot. If they don't have a family of their own I guess it makes more sense they don't like it since they couldn't relate. Otherwise the poaching, the colonizing, families trying to stick together through the chaos, those are all real things people and animals are going through right this second. That hasn't changed since the 13 years this movie has been in development. It was simply beautifully captured. Yes, they probably should have left some cut scenes in to explain a bit more on certain topics. However, the movie was already a little over 3 hours I'm sure they were trying to keep it at a certain time frame. Hopefully they get into all of the things that went unanswered in the third one, if they have one, because it certainly looked intriguing. Visually the movie I mean stunning! No other words you've just gotta watch it just alone for that tbh."
"Being a fan from avatar 1 , I was looking forward to watch the continue of this movie really much ! To tell you the truth i was a little disappointed cuz it was a well-known movie that everyone was waiting to watch what will follow after 10 years ... but it was so soFirst of all I want to mention that everything was well organized and james Cameron tried his best .I really enjoy the story ( but I think that there are a few plot holes that I hope to be explained somehow) and I didn't understand how fast time past, I knew it was a 3 hour movie but it felt like 1 hour !?Also there are moments that my heartbeat was about to burst, I felt anxious about what will come next and I felt emotions that I didn't expect... I even cried at the end .There are a lot of moral issues and family issues that everyone can understand and identify AND of course there are a lot of message for the protection of the nature as well.I recommend you to watch this movie especially at the cinema for full experience!Can't wait for avatar 3!"
"Once again, Cameron brings us back to Pandora after twelve years and he shows us amazing creatures lively on screen. Especially the water,it is so clear and bright and you can't imagine that it is CGI. I thought i was watching a documentary like Planet Earth because that's so real and it seemed that Cameron really came to Pandora and filmed it face to face.But I have to say that the film is not perfect. The biggest weak point is its storyline as it is in a traditional story structure about family. That's very normal and didn't show something new. Moreover,I don't think Spider is shaped well as his motives are not very credible.But the defects cannot obscure the virtues. Just do not wait and buy tickets. Don't think too much and enjoy the beauty of Pandora."
"A Visual Treat Movie With Spectacular Visuals Watching This Movie In 3D Was A Proper Experience How To Watch This Movie Avatar The Way Of Water Is The Best Movie Of 2022 and just like the 1st Part Its Absolutely Brilliant Movie A Masterpiece, It's A Beautiful Movie. Music Of The Movie Was Good. Talking about its music James Cameron movies had James Horner doing the music for example the Titanic and avatar which were blockbuster iconic movies and it had a beautiful spectacular music this also has a good music. James Cameron Direction Is Awesome And The Use Of 3D Is Brilliant, Story Is Good And The Screenplay Even Though It's A 3 hour movie it was worth watching. 4.5/5."
"Remarkable Movie. James Cameron is a legend in creating worlds and universes. If only he is interested in comics and save DC from itself. Anyway the movie is amazing. New world and new views. I took my 5 years old daughter and she was amazed with the colors and the sea world that JC created, he simply outdid himself in that one. The movie is 3 hours and 15 minutes long yet time goes by with feeling it. You will not be bored, you will be amazed. According to JC he will created 3 more giving a total of 5 movies to tell such an epic tale. Hope it will end perfectly same as it started as I believe 5 movies around pandora is too much but let's wait and see. Highly recommended in IMAX."
After 10 mins of watching the special effects this movie is just boring - even then the special effects are so over engined it feels fake and I wonder why they used actors at all....it has barely a plot/ Storyline it was like a book for 2 year olds especially not one that can sustain 3 hours of entertainment. What is there is hackneyed and repetitive.Ended up walking out of the theatre after 2 hours as I just couldn't sit there any longer watching the drivel. I cannot understand how so many people have rated this so highly. I won't even bother watching the rest of this movie when it is streamed.
"I loved the first Avatar and when I saw the trailer for the second one I felt disappointed. The trailer just didn't grab me and I was tempted not to watch at all but I'm so glad I did.The effects were great and the story was good too. Was the story perfect? No, but nevertheless it was good.I thought this film would feel like it was too long but once I was gripped i totally lost track of time.For me the only part that didn't really work for me was sigourney weaver's voice. I don't want to go into detail as don't want to give spoilers.I watched it in 3D which I would recommend for the graphics."
"Okay, I know. Paper thin plot, great vfx etc etc From the outset that's the truth.However if you are a new parent, dad especially, then you're going to cry. I was actually in a Cameron movie! I would never have imagined that!The way it was filmed...in an iMAX viewing...you feel your kids are threatened for real. Also the brutality towards the creatures is mind bending. I'm almost thinking to become vegan.The duration is really long...but I liked the anti-climactic part of the finale because it gave me time to stop crying (silently of course) and disengage a bit emotionally from the action.Cameron you are a beast of a filmmaker.My 10/10 ranking is for making me empathise with the family.If you are single, young or against kids, then the film has a weaker punch for you."
"Undoubtedly the best movie I have watched this year. A lot of reviews online will tell you that this movie misses a great plot but that's something the upcoming movies will have in the future. Trust me.The title of the movie simply says it all. ""The Way of Water"" is not something you should avoid when watching. This film was released only to make viewers revisit the planet of Pandora and experience its beautiful biomes after a long time, nearly 13 years. The ""stale"" story was supposed to show the new never seen before islandic tribes. The movie's main intent was not to lead the other upcoming films of the series but to show how extravagant life could be.Needless to say but it is evident that Cameron and his team have worked brilliantly to make this masterpiece. The film follows great CGI effects just like the first one did and manages to add more depth in many scenes with new graphical engineering. Would watch it for the first time again anytime if I had the chance."
"Visually this film is stunning.But we all knew it would be.The whole 'getting to know your environment' was a bit boring second time round
Zoe Zaldana spends the entire film in hysterics, so she won't be thanking Cameron for bringing her back for this one. Maybe in the next one she'll have a bit more to do than run around screaming at everyone.Kate Winslett's character also seemed to be overly angry all the time.Maybe James is working through some issues.It was nice to see Jermaine Clement in the movie, but it was a shame that it was the anti-whaling propaganda hour of the film.James Cameron clearly won't be told when his ideas are daft. He doesn't need the studio money any more and can take his projects in any direction he wants. Even if it's the wrong direction."
"These three words came to my mind when I watched the beautiful Pandora, when I have seen how some humans try to destroy, rob and they despise everything beautiful. I saw that hope can't be destroyed, or robbed.Hope always stays with us who feel a strong desire, hankered for a deep connection and meaningful life.James Cameron gave us a much deeper meaning than a simple beautiful movie. He is a contemporary J. R. R Tolkien and Frank Herbert.These years, waiting for a 2nd movie...I hope till the next one won't be too long. I'm grateful to live and see his magic. And I could learn the way of water."
"This movie is Visually stunning and I'm sure everyone agrees with that. Although I see so many reviews on here saying that the Plot and story brings the movie down. I strongly disagree, the plot setup is the only thing weighing this movie down from being almost perfect. The setup feels too similar to the original and a little random/unnecessary. The movie makes up for its mediocre plot with some fantastic story telling, emotion, and action. I never would have thought that people in motion capture suits being turned into blue people could capture and make me feel so much emotion for fictional characters. Every hit that the Na'vi took I could feel, every lost warrior was a blow and tug on my heart strings, which had gotten connected to these characters after the hefty run time we spent with them. So glad this movie did as good as the original because this is one of few times a year I would count going to the theaters an ""experience""."
"God THAT was boring! There's no plot, nothing gets resolved, no depth, no context at all, and it was E N D L E S S.At least some kids around us seemed to be invested.These high ratings... HOW ? It can only be because of the visuals... Too bad for us who were expecting an actual movie.The pity is that I loved the first Avatar so much! Ugh... So disappointing...Why does my review have to have 600 characters even? 😂There is nothing to tell..Yeah ok, it looked good, but is that enough for you? I felt like a watched an unnecessarily long intro for the next movies to come. Nothing happens or gets even presented in this one. Everything is promised for the sequels.And well, I'm not gonna watch them, sorry.OK. I met the character limit now so cheers."
"I remember when the first film came out in 2009, my mother and I went to watch it, it was the first 3D film we ever watched. An unforgettable experience, nothing like Avatar had ever been done before, in terms of cinematography, visual effects and experience.13 years later, I must admit I did lose my interest for a while but it was instantly reignited when I knew I'll finally watch the sequel after years of postponement and delay. Do I still feel the same way after 13 years, the same fascination my 8 year old self had? No I don't, I FEEL EVEN MORE INTENSE AWE AND FASCINATION. The first film was groundbreaking so we all knew the second film would be too. What the first one did on land, the second one amplified under water, every shot was visually pleasing, serene, calm and immersive. Simultaneously, I was also at the edge of my seat during the action scenes, vocally rooting for the Na'vi. People are quick to shut down the plot of Avatar but this time it fleshed out the characters, had an exhilarating buildup to the climax and a moving end.This is also the first film to ever have underwater motion capture, actors genuinely filmed their scenes underwater, just shows how much dedication, innovation and work was put into this sequel. Avatar is not just a visual innovation, it is a technical one too.Basically, if you're looking for a visual feast to calm your nerves but also keep you up and invested in the character and story, then Avatar: The Way of The Water is a must watch."
"Was expecting a big budget CGI action movie, instead got a big budget CGI wildlife documentary with some teen drama intermixed. There is essentially 1 big action scene in the entire movie in the end with 1 smaller one at the start of movie. And the movie lasts over 3 hours if it was a shorter movie then it would be acceptable. Didn't come to see it for the story but for the CGI action extravaganza and got nothing.The story is weak, the action scenes are nothing special, the characters are forgettable, the villain is rehashed, no meaningful themes are explored except perhaps pacifism and non aggression.The worst part I guess is there is no wonder of different alien beings and different culture instead their teenage children act and whats worst talk like (the constant use of word bro) human children. Actually on second thought I think human children have better vocabulary skills and are more intelligent because they certainly didn't seem to enjoy the movie."
"Another masterpiece of cinematography. Surpassed all expectations as a sequel, and set the foundation for a bright future for the franchise. 13 years ago, I went back to the theater over and over watching the first Avatar, probably saw it 8 times before being released on dvd. The wait has been so hard, but as of finishing this film, the wait was more than worth it. As the credits rolled, I had to wipe my face and try to compose myself before getting up to leave the theater. 10/10 for visuals, storyline, and ability to capture the viewer and drag them on an incredible journey.Kiri touched my soul.Thank you so much Jim!"
"Phenomenal story. Phenomenal visuals. The IMAX 3D was the best 3D experience I have ever had. If you see it, don't do 2D. Go for the IMAX 3D experience. I was floored by this movie. I will be seeing it again!The story is about Jake and his family again having to fight off the human military. The villains were cruel just like in the first movie, but the character development surpasses everything the first movie did. I am not surprised it took them 13 years to finally get the movie done, but all of that time was worth it. I don't see how visual effects can ever advance more than in this movie. 10/10, go see it!"
Visually Avatar 2 certainly provides but sadly the storyline is well below expectations. Same crap different day....same confused confrontations without any real substance. There was opportunity to pull out something stunning but instead we had the same rehash the marketing people believe will pull in the $$. We had plenty of spiritual inspiration mixed with a bit of Whale Rider and The Titanic. In fact some scenes I almost thought I was watching The Titanic. Just felt this was a script that would have worked 20yrs ago but spiritual awareness has shifted...the inspiration mixed with what marketing thinks will sell has ended up as something that just lacks / contradicts / leaks like a sieve. Hopefully Avatar 3 keeps pace with where the globe is at with intelligence...we are well beyond being spoon fed outdated ideals...masculinity has shifted beyond the 'kill zone' - gender isn't defined by physicality. Spiritual divinity is balancing divine feminine with divine masculine...balancing nurture with action / feeling with practicality. Avatar 2 needed to incorporate an evolving global understanding...keep pace with the audience which involves more creative and risk confidence in the script. Sadly the script doesn't keep pace with the visual capabilities. Let's hope Avatar 3 doesn't get lost in delays with production and keeps pace.... I suspect it might need a storyline rewrite otherwise it might be like watching a 50yr old sitcom.
"I largely thought Avatar 2 was a boring, long, predictable, inconsistent CGI, video game esc movie, filled with poor writing and conventional Hollywood story structure. There was lots of beautiful and definitely groundbreaking technical and filmmaking aspects, however the uncomfortable frame rate during the water scenes, including strange out of place poorly made CGI (the initial water attack on Lo'ak), stuck out like a sore thumb. Furthermore, I genuinely started to drift off and asked myself, surely this 3+ hour drag could be an engaging 2 hours epic? The initial anti-imperial, post-colonial, and pro-ecological message of the first movie was powerful and uniquely done. But this just shoved it down your throat without ever taking a more original/changing the angle.Overall, as a fan of the first film, it definitely wasn't worth the 13 year wait. Cameron has to prioritise character development, credible writing, and original story structure, over trying to break the box office and making the big bucks."
"People aren't going to remember Way of Water until they rewatch its rerelease right before Avatar 3.I liked Avatar. It was forgettable, but I appreciated the world design and visual storytelling on display. It had a simple, generic plot that despite the length doesn't overstay its welcome.Way of Water is aptly bloated, with too many side characters and subplots, most of which aren't explored to an effective level.The film starts off incredibly disjointed, sacrificing what could have been a great reentry to Pandora for voiceover and montages of new developments since the previous film, before the villains descend upon the planet. The villains (some of whom are resurrected, stakes from the first film be damned I guess?) that have more ships, more mechs, and set up foundations far faster. Great.We then get a short time skip, with our insurgent protagonists fighting against the 'skypeople'. Ok, so we're back to square one, or two really. But why?Avatar was already a decent foundation for a great sequel (Terminator 1 is fine, but 2 shined from what 1 set up). Way of Water acts like it's setting up the main story, still. It's been 6 hours. This isn't a 90s sci-fi TV show, it's a film series. I don't want to watch 6 hours of generic plot to get to something interesting (which honestly, Avatar 3 very well might be).Fortunately there is some good to be found here. The visuals are stunning. This film quite simply has the best visual effects I've ever seen, and I expect it won't be topped until Avatar 3. The 48 frames per second worked really well (in IMAX 3D, not sure about 2D) and gave an incredible sense of fluidity to the underwater scenes.And changing to underwater was a great idea, we've seen the forests, what more does this planet have to offer? Well we find out a small part of it, and I assume there will be more biomes in the sequels.It did essentially feel like a documentary at points, with a decent amount of time spent just showing off nature and no dialogue. I didn't mind it. The only times I was brought out of my immersion tended to be when child or teenage characters spoke dialogue not befitting them. Sure, they're aliens, but it felt like young people being written poorly, not borne from a different way of life.The exception is the character of Kiri, which was perhaps the most interesting part of the film for me. Her connection to the planet's biological memory bank (the most interesting part of the first film) was fascinating, and a decent portion of time was given to her character.Spider though, a human boy who grew up in both worlds, was a confusing addition. His decisions were chosen from shallow motivations. His character could be really interesting, but just not enough is done with it.The water tribes were also underwhelming. Being from New Zealand, it was nice to see the influence of Maori culture, and Cliff Curtis is always a good addition to a film. But we don't see enough variety between the tribes, and their presence is weirdly forgotten about in one of the action sequences of the film.I suspect if there's an extended edition, there will be a scene or two to fill the gap.So, Way of Water was incredibly disappointing, especially considering Cameron's track record with sequels. Is it a bad film? No, the spectacle really does wonders for it and I don't regret going at all. It's also nice that there is heart to be found here; James Cameron really believes in this world and as a result it never feels soulless.But the whole package could have been so much better. A tighter focus on some of the ideas would have gone a long way. Less characters, and more subtlety would have been appreciated too. Does the writing staff really need to hit the audience over the head with their themes? Did we really need to do another three hour movie that seems to be interested in what comes next? Probably not.At the end of the day, a film this long should not feel rushed. Especially one that is guaranteed to have a substantial amount of money poured into it. I do hope they refine the script for the sequel, and hell maybe the extended cut will improve things here.But, I'm not anticipating much."
"This could easily have been James Cameron masterpiece, as the progress done with underwater 3D special effects, creation of new creatures, absolutely perfect realist beings, dynamics, etc. It is stunning and the part where Sully family lives on the islands and learn the new near water world is pleasant to see for adults as well as for children. But then literally half of the movie is lost in an incredibly dull and boring bottle between the ""good guys"" and the ""bad guys"", which is so against the point made by Pandora's people during the entire movie.I just ask myself why it is so. I believe that the producers of the movie planned to spend so much money that they believed that by turning it into an action movie would have assured success. But honestly, I think they missed their chance. A lot of people went to see it, sure, but how many will see the follow up? So many, like me, were so bored by the story that they will not. They have just been shortsighted by their fear of creating a better story."
"This film is just awful. It's pretty and marginally original but the story is so bad that there is no redemption, especially after 3 hours. Allow me to explain.The CG quality is a solid 8/10. There are parts of this that are absolutely gorgeous and mind boggling. Then there are parts that look straight out of a video game. I really wanted the whole affair to be just out of this world but some things just didn't work. The ship coming over the horizon at 60 or so FPS while everything else around is 30 is both confusing and headache inducing. The characters always look pretty good. The world looks okay most of the time but parts are hit or miss.The story is a flat 4/10. This story is awful. You've seen it before. The only part of this story that is worth anything is the daughter played by Sigourny Weaver and that's because her part is the only original bit of this film. Every single bit of the other story is a mix of the first Avatar and cliches. Not only that though. Scenes are unbelievably repetitive, for example. The son goes and gets in trouble and comes back and then after goes and and gets in trouble and comes back and goes and gets in trouble and comes back. Or the scene I've seen mentioned plenty is where they are tied up on the ship 3 times in a row. 3 scenes that accomplish the same goal. Most of them are nonsense.The problem with this film in reality is that it tries to justify it's runtime with scenes in which nothing happens or something nonsensical happens. I feel as though there is a 4 hour and some change cut of this film that cuts some parts back and expands on scenes to make some sense out of it. Okay one more complaint...Spider and the return of the bad guy from the first. Dear God. Spider is one of the most useless characters I've seen in a film in a long while. The entire reason he's there is to save the bad guy in the end. That's it. The only conflict they could come up with was him seeing Neytiri angry TWICE. That's it. He even let dude go die. Except that he happened upon him sorta breathing. Stupid. Speaking of stupid, the bad guys return. You have an entire planet of original characters and you choose to bring the bad guy that DIED back from the dead. So many interesting ideas that could be and they landed dead on arrival with the same baddie. It doesn't work and gets worse when you think about the fact that they brought him back just to kill Sully. That's the whole plot. Baddie back to kill. Done. That's the movie.My hope is that the next film will concentrate on more original characters and have more plot than just kill the guy and some whales."
"This movie was so good. James Cameron delivered on all aspects. The story, visuals, and characters were all done really well and a vast improvement from the first film. I always felt the characters in the first movie lacked more depth besides Neytiri. This movie does this. Jake is much more fleshed out and you see his true personality come through. A father who is very military based and runs his family like that, but will protect them with everything he has. Quaritch was also done much better this time and has more depth than just a mean military man. I am excited to see where his story goes from here.This movie is not perfect by any means. Some cuts can be jarring and the story can be a tad messy but overall it is a HIGHLY enjoyable movie. I actually wish it was longer so less was cut out. I was in awe the entire time and have already seen it twice.Bottom line is main storyline is simple and easy to follow. Action is epic and heart pounding. Emotional scenes will hit you with a brick and have you struggling not to cry. Go watch it in theatres as it is truly a cinematic experience."
"Amazing visuals and a good premise is let down by a lack of plot. This film was clearly written to be the first half of a different film.Ultimately it's a high school drama about kids being forced to move because of their parents. All the classic clichés are there, the girl falling for the new kid, the troubled teen discovering herself, the popular boys bullying the new kids and tricking them into bad situations followed by them becoming friends for a common goal, the annoying youngest sibling always being in the wrong place, the new kids befriending an outcast against everyone's wishes who turns out to be a good guy etc etc. It's actually embarrassing how predictable all the story ""developments"" were.There's a great buildup with the humans returning to the planet and establishing a city, which is promptly forgotten about and never part of the plot again. I assume this is for the 3rd movie. I'm guessing they'll go full airbender and join the fire tribe next.The final fight should have been a mid-film skirmish, I honestly had to check my watch because I was sure there'd be another hour of film to battle in the city.Overall it's an overly predictable, coming of age tween drama with enough visuals and good action scenes to keep the masses from hating it."
"Do you think this movie won't be better than the first one ? You're absolutely right. Visually, it is far better than the previous one. Everything about it is fantastic, except for the story part. For me, it felt just like the same story of the first one with little changes, but still a masterpiece of enjoyment. I've seen it twice already and I'll definitely see it for a third time. What a great cinematic event !James Cameron is the only director who makes the event as big as possible. His vision needs to be seen as an epic drama with a plain and beautiful message in it. You need to see it as soon as possible. This movie can't be seen unless on the biggest screen there is."
"We have never seen this level of technical excellence in any movie before. Maybe Alita Battle Angel, and Thanos, and this movie surpasses both. It was as jaw dropping as the first movie and just as immersive.I spend the whole movie wondering, how on earth this was made. Surely they had to invent a lot of technology to get the Skin right, the water, and the animation.The visuals were so breath taking that sometimes you forget the main story and just get sucked into pandora and they Navi' way of life.They have set up the sequel well without forcing it into this instalment. In Conclusion I would recommend that you watch this movie in IMAX 3D or as a minimum at the Cinema/Theatre. It was worth it."
"It is not the same as the first Avatar. Yes, the graphic is there, filming is amazing, scenes are beautiful. However, two major reasons why 8 out of 10. First, the plot is very trivial and predictable. Bad guy is chasing a good guy, fighting, shooting, someone is killed. Second, the constant thought I had during the whole 3 hour film is how violent a human being is. There are lots of fights, anger and violence in the film. At least, 60-70% of Avatar is fights. I don't think children below 16 years old even accompanied by their parents should be allowed to watch it.I must say that Avatar made an impact on me. I am not sure bad or good but at the bare minimum, it made me write this review."
I liked this Avatar film better than the first film in every single way. The visuals in this film are at a level that has never been seen before and I'm not even exaggerating. Wow just wow! The story was rich and I also loved the new characters. It's a cross between Jaws and Wakanda Forever. James Cameron has proven yet again that he knows aquatics better than any other director - lol. On top of all of this - I'll admit that the fact that I saw this in RPX made the experience even more enjoyable than anticipated. Please don't listen to the naysayers and go see this film! It's the best family film to come out in a long time.
"3 Hours of a movie Where you can understand the ending since the beginning. Where did the people of the sea went when there was a war at the end? They were all there and suddenly only the main family is there?......................... Waste of time and money. Plot is useless and awful. One hour of them swimming near fisesh without any meaning. Everything is Just so disappoing in this movie. The first one was not great, like pocahontas in blue, this one instead is Just a random movie, with a random plot, that let u see a videogame charachter in a film. Honestly, the worst movie i ve seen in ages. Zombie vs. Strippers its better, at list they have a plot."
"Watching three hours of CGI is like watching a gamer on twitch playing a video game.The story (basically a war story, good against evil) was too flat for three hours.No surprises at all.Dull action scenes, a severed arm, a lot of guns and shooting. Not to forget the occasional drama.I also keep wondering if the movie would be that successful without naming all the famous actors.The roles could have been played by any decent actor.In the end the story is even more diluted by showing one useless scene after the other just to show off the technical advances they have made compared to the first Avatar movie."
"Its waste... the movie is a crap.. not even close to the first part.the American director made the clans in other planet speak English flutently and their kids behave like American kids using the American slangs. The only saving grace is the fight scenes and tht too not even close to the first part. All of sudden the brave Sully become pusssy and runs away to save his family leaving his clan behind , no explanation give. The sea clan fight with sully but thy seddenly disappears and only the family defeats the enemy. The biggest monsters creature of water are shown disciples of Mahatma Gandhi, no violence."
"I really wish that Director James Cameron would introduce himself to Screenwriter James Cameron.Director James Cameron makes movies that are stunning to look at and worth the 3D up charge more than any other movie before or since. Viewed on a big movie theater screen, the spectacle alone will take moviegoers' collective breath away. It's hard to tell what is real and what is Cameron's effects team. More than almost any other movies, the two Avatars are worth watching on a big screen. It's almost like watching one of the big Disney nature documentaries.Screenwriter James Cameron has a great deal of difficulty in writing stories and dialogue that are worthy of Director Janes Cameron's gift. It becomes tedious and starts one fidgeting because the characters we are supposed to care for are basically one note personalities without the benefit of looking different enough to tell them apart. When the battle starts, it's hard to keep track of who is who, and we have no emotional investment in any of them to care who lives and who dies.In Way of Water, the choice of not putting the climax of the story arc happen 45 minutes before the movie ends is a wise one, but there's about an hour and a half of lackluster dialogue in the middle that could have been trimmed to twenty minutes or so. It resembles the aforementioned Disney nature documentaries, but without the narration, and without the educational aspect.Titanic worked because, even though the characters were mostly stereotypes, there was something recognizable about them that most people could see themselves in the situations in that movie. Granted the boat sinking is the real draw, but having someone to root for in whom we can recognize our own hopes and fears, allows us to have a stake in their survival, if only as avatars for us.The plot is basically Dances With Wolves 2. ""Blue People Good, Everyone Else Bad."" There are very few exceptions to this rule, but not by more than a Navi handful.My recommendation? See this on the big screen, in 3D. It's not going to have the benefits of those on a home video console and the story isn't enough to make it worthwhile without."
"This movie is amazing if I speak visually. The sea creatures were amazing the story was good too. But I don't know why at some point it felt like it was an uneven fight. James can easily make the Navi a bit stronger than before. And it seemed unreal how they were fighting against a super modern army with almost nothing. The whole movie was good but at some point, you'll see some unrealistic movement in the characters like their movement is smoothing out. I don't know if it's just for the theater I watched but it was pretty annoying. 3D layering was good but I missed the color depth and contrast because of my local theater."
"It would be missing the point to call the proceedings indulgent to the point of self-infatuation: Cameron has built a new world from the remixed bits of this one, and he seems determined that we should not simply visit Pandora, we should live in it. It's more than you can possibly imagine. A fantasy world so vivid and real it commands your full attention for 3h 12m. And when it's done, you'll still want to linger in this heightened state of make believe.It's more than you can possibly imagine. A fantasy world so vivid and real it commands your full attention for 3h 12m. And when it's done, you'll still want to linger in this heightened state of make believe."
"Finally got the chance to view this movie the other night and I can say after 12 years of waiting, it was definitely worth the wait. The visuals in this movie are stunning and some of the best I've seen in a long time. This movie brought back so many memories of when I was a kid and seen the original Avatar. It was great to see most of the original cast again as well as the newcomers in this movie. I did feel by the end though, that there were a few plot holes and it left me with some questions I felt that were left unanswered. It made me leave wanting more. Overall it was worth the wait. Can't wait for the next 3 Avatar movies."
"What does someone want in a movie good visuals,story and screenplay. Avatar 2 released in theatres and everybody was going on about how beautiful the movie looks and not a single person is talking about the story aspect of the movie. So the story is literally same as avatar 1 which was fantastic and ahead of its time and now comes its successor avatar 2 with same storyline and an improved CG. In this movie the visuals act as a foundation while the story is created in a way to support these visuals and not vice versa. At some point I was feeling the duration of the movie where it felt like watching a Documentary of sea animals on an alien planet. JC is a great director and has proved he can do what he sets to do but this movie was just hiding behind the mind-blowing visuals while the story and screenplay kind of felt flat. This is my own experience of the movie and not a review just my personal opinions."
"I know the movie is not the smartest, and I wasn't expecting that. A movie can be basic and enjoyable, there are tons of examplew, mainly on teenagers movies where all of them follow the same pattern, BUT, you need a good lead actor and here is where Sam Worthington fails, he doesn't have expressions, he is so plain that even his avatar fails on expressions, you can see the difference everytime Zoe saldaña enters the screen, she feels so live, so real, that you think sully is just a dumb guy that don't know nothing. This guy should really go back to acting school please, or changing him for the next avatar instalment."
"Well, the name Avatar definitely has become a synonym for visual and special effects masterpiece. Everything you expect from this part to visually deliver, it has delivered. And beyond that. Watching this movie in 3D is an unique experience that no movie can ever compete with. But not everything was sweet and butter here, as the movie was dragged out more then it should be. Around the half of the movie is where they lost my attention and all the hype and excitement started to drop. I can easily recommend this to everyone as Avatar is and always will be a unique visual experience, but if you want to be amazed, surprised or shocked by some outwardly twists and spinoffs, you won't be. Enjoy it for what it is."
"This film was utter tosh. Pretty to look at, but no story. Way too long as well.The starts with a load of exposition dumps to try and set up some kind of story. We are no longer looking for Unobtainium, but something that make humans live longer and oh yeah Earth is dying some we want to move to their planet. There is a lot of pretty swimming underwater, a whale thing has a flash back, one of the blue people has Mother Earth super powers and the son is total screw up all the way through, without redemption. The action at the end is OK, but very forgettable.This cost obscene amount of money to make. Please start with a good story then make it pretty."
"I'm pretty loud when it comes to bitching about movies being unnecessarily long due to senselessly extended action sequences.Therefore I walked about very surprised and satisfied out of Avatar: The Way Of Water today. Over three hours long, and boy couldn't I get enough of this flick.Beautifully composed and very atmospheric, the movie pulled me right back into the world of Pandora (which I haven't visited since Avatar hit theatres back in 2009). Watching it in 4DX definitely helped me to sink in deep, and I caught myself thinking that this could go on for another three hours and I wouldn't be mad about it.The story is basic, but it's emotionally grabbing and full of positive messages through and through. The heroes are compelling and likeable, the villains are easy to dislike. The world gets build phenomenally, and the action sequences are intense, but far from overloaded.Visually this is an absolute treat, and the score is subtle but effective.I don't have any profound issues with this movie whatsoever. A delight from start to finish, and a very satisfying way to end my movie year of 2022.9,5/10."
"The movie is well filmed 🎥, the directors paid attention to every small detail, beautiful 3D movie!The story was awesome The acting in the movie was good. The film was about 3h long, but I personally think it is worth watching!This movie continued the storyline of avatar extremely well, I am hyped and waiting for the third film by avatar if they decide to make one.The movie ended with a small cliffhanger, witch leaves some hope that we will have another avatar movie!So, I recommend this movie to anyone who liked the first avatar movie. And this movie has great production quality.Great movie!"
I really liked the first movie. Saw it on it's release day with that cool new thing called 3D. Nose hurt like hell from those heavy glasses after 3 hours. But it was so worth it. Watched it a few times more through the years and was really looking forward for this sequal. This time I skipped the 3D and chose the normal version. Really glad I did. The movie is an art phenomenon. Every frame is like a painting. Really like the underwater world. Almost as much as the forest in the first movie. The cast is solid and the times fly. It's basically a copy of the first movie. Defend the home and family from the attacker. So why a 10? Basically the story of the movie is a 7. But it gets and extra point because of the beauty and CGI. It gets an additional point because they dare to kill a main character off. And it gets it's final point because they dare to go against the norm today that must include wokeness. This movie tries to give the audience what they really want. Not what some people think everone wants.
"I loved the first one and had high expectations for this one too, but it was a bit disappointing. I'm not judgy, in fact I always try to enjoy the movie no matter what but during watching this I felt like it was unnecessarily extensive, with those children/parents dramas and etc.I don't know why they decided that it would be entertaining to see the avatars and the giant sea creatures being so weak and hopeless, instead it'd have been greater to see some more realistic fighting scenes other then superior robocop techs.Yes, it is a movie that everyone shall see, effects are so fine, but some of the episodes were like nightmare to watch, and I did force myself to finish it.Took 13 years of making and me being so critical not fair I know but screenplay was nothing impressive. Hereby to mention Mr. Camerons fetish of sinking boats, Although the beauty of Pandora is greatly displayed."
"Visuals - 4/5
Story - 0.5/5James Cameron seems to have forgotten that he's not making a CGI alien lifestyle documentary, but a movie with a story.Sadly, the story is completely missing. Sure, it had some funny and wholesome scenes at the start, but slowly it starts feeling boring. The movie is an hour too long. I was constantly looking at my watch to see when it'll end.The action was good, but the climax was lackluster, not to mention, it wasn't much different from part one. Actually, it wasn't different at all.It was a complete waste of time for me. Same hero, same villain, same ending duel which results in no victory of any side. The villain even survived unscathed. Heck, our hero suffered instead.There was zero conclusion to anything at the end of the story. Was this whole movie just about making the hero realise he needs to fight instead of running away? If yes, then I'm even more disappointed.Seriously, if I knew it'd be this boring, I'd have rather slept at home than waste my weekend.I seriously hope this one flops so we don't have to deal with James Cameron's senseless flexing of 'Oh look at mah graphics.'He may be a genius, but this ain't it."
"Overall an enjoyable experience with breathtaking visuals. However, there were definitely times when it felt like they were trying to drag out a relatively simple plot purely for the sake of CGI flexing. It sometimes feels more like taking a CGI tour of a virtual museum than actually watching the story go anywhere. It's understandable that they want the audience to get the full experience of the different fictional regions that are explored in this movie, but I don't know if it's enough to justify making this movie over three hours long. The real meat of the storyline could arguably have been covered in like...an hour lol. Still, I think it was a pretty good movie."
"Well if truth be told, if you've never seen Avatar then go see it its lovely on the eye and has a story that we all heard before with no twists to upset your concentration..
But if you are an OG and have seen Avatar 13 years ago then steer clear, they've done a Star Wars: oppressive force, destroy shield generator, use the local forces to take out evil overlord type thing... again.. with the same people.Technically it was a superb anthology to James Cameron, a superb score from James Horner (Well it would be as he reused all of the key chords, melodies from his last collaboration with JC) and then the scene duplicates, from Titanic (on a alien moon, I kid you not), Aliens, The Abyss (an amazing film), lots of homages to his major works even the scene in Aliens (another superb film) where Sigourney loses newt at the very last minutes... down to the squeal as she disappears. Don't get me started on the AbyssBut the worst thing I found was the super high clarity of the film, wow 4k+ , but whatever virtually high shutter speed he used on his cameras ruined it, no motion blur at all, just ultra clear high speed action which I felt looked unnatural, very PS5.The underwater scenes, lighting, haze, etc...however were visually stunning and very realistic - I think I miss diving 😕 !Annoyed? No not really I was playing hunt the Cameron/Horner homages from 60 minutes in, its what you need to do to accommodate 3 hrs and 14 mins on your numb bottom."
"This movie really took me for a very wild ride. I laughed a lot, I felt the most gruesome anger for the sky people, and I cried A LOT!!!! This was without a doubt the best movie I have ever seen, with the most amazing visuals and with sound that really made me think that some of the background noise made by the birds and water was really happening around me. The writing was impeccable, and the actors were faultless. You really fall in love with all the characters and learn so much more about the Native people of Pandora. Really recommend this film if you want to go on an emotional roller coaster that makes you feel all the emotions, you will not be disappointed at all! Great job James Cameron once again. Well done!!!"
"It has been 13 years since the world swarmed to theaters to experience James Cameron's ""Avatar"" to the tune of a still-withstanding world record gross of $2.9 billion. When you sell tickets at that rate and have the track record of James Cameron, especially with sequels, it's a given that people will once again fill up theaters during opening week. That creates pressure to live up to expectations, primarily when a large percentage of Cameron's fans have held a grudge against the accomplished director since he announced he would be shipping himself off to Pandora for the next 20-plus years to make four more Avatar films. I was in that same camp when I learned that James Cameron would exclusively make sequels to what I considered one of his weakest projects for the foreseeable future. Of course, a soft entry by his standard is an accomplishment to most, but the original ""Avatar"" is known for its awe-inspiring visuals, not its compelling plot or characters. There isn't anything wrong with the story itself, but it's anti-colonial primitive versus advanced army tropes have been told countless times before. To many, ""Avatar"" is just Pocahantus with a blue skin on top. While I think that is doing a disservice to what we got, there is merit to that statement, and I left ""Avatar"" amazed at what I witnessed but not itching to revisit these characters or this world. Luckily the same can't be said after leaving ""Avatar: The Way of Water,"" as I cannot wait to see what Cameron will cook up with Avatar 3, 4, and 5.Going back to James Cameron's track record with sequels, his last two are considered some of the best movies of all time: ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" and ""Aliens."" Both of those films improved on classic movies in their own right, and if anyone can make ""blue Pocahontas"" into a blockbuster franchise that makes its mark on pop culture, it's James Cameron. And just like clockwork, he does it again with ""Avatar: The Way of Water,"" improving on its predecessor. With that said, this movie is not perfect, and as epic as it is in certain parts, it still feels like an appetizer to the main course and will leave you wanting more while simultaneously wanting less. We'll start with the movie's length: it is too long, and less would've benefitted this film and its replay value. The plot of this movie is an improvement from the first, but it's still a simple plot and does not warrant a 3-hour 12-minute run time. The visuals are improved from the first movie as well, and every time the movie slows to a crawl, you're subject to astonishing visuals, but they, too, don't warrant this film's length.""The Way of Water"" rushes into its story, and it becomes clear Cameron wants to get to the world-building, visual wonderment in the second act when we get fed exposition in a clunky fashion. Immediately we learn that the big bad from the original ""Avatar,"" Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), is back from the dead in Na'Vi form. Cameron retconned in a story element that Quaritch and the other dead marines uploaded their memories to a supercomputer before their deaths, allowing them to implant them into Na'Vi bodies. Their main task in this movie is to ""pacify"" the local Pandora species and colonize the planet for humanity since they destroyed earth, starting with the marine traitor, Jake Sully (Sam Worthington). Instantly the elements of a revenge plot are set up, but the actual antagonists of this movie are the planet-destroying humans and the military. Cameron has long considered himself an activist, and while he presents his points without subtlety and they can come across as cliché, the message is commendable.The first act introduces us to most of our new characters, including Jake Sully and Neytiri's (Zoe Saldana) children, who play a prominent role in this movie. They have two teen sons, Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton), and a daughter named Tuk (Trinity Jo-Li Bliss). They are the caretakers of Kiri (Sigourney Weaver), the offspring of Sigourney Weaver's character from the first movie, and Spider (Jack Champion), a semi-feral human who grew up on Pandora with the Na'vi quickly revealed to be the son of Colonel Quaritch. There is a fantastic hostage scene in which Jake and Neytiri must rescue the kids from Quaritch's troops. Cameron builds tremendous tension as the stage gets deadly silent and our protagonists sneak up. All we can hear is the rain as these characters position themselves to ambush. This scene makes sure to utilize our human senses to make us feel like we are there. The water feels real and palpable, and the way the rays of light burst through pockets of leaves in the trees feels natural. I compare this craftmanship of light and sound to Scott Ridley's sci-fi classic ""Blade Runner.""I wish more of the movie were like this scene, but unfortunately, the film slows to a crawl in the second act as the Sully family moves in with the water clan, the Metkayina. Here we have family drama elements as the kids struggle to fit in with the other kids, must deal with bullying, and try to fit in. We learn about the Way of Water, and our main characters spend a ton of time in the ocean interacting with alien sea creatures and adapting to their new life. As I mentioned, this act has many stunning visuals, but only a few critical story beats. There is some set-up for future Avatar movies where Kiri begins connecting with the planet and learning underwater force powers. Still, they could have cut 25 minutes of this act alone without losing any exposition.The other negative that comes to mind is the dialogue. James Cameron has never been known for impressive conversation or witty banter in his movies, and this movie is no exception. Most of the humor is dry, many lines are cheesy, and others feel forced. Even so, you feel for each of these main characters, and there's a novelty to Cameron's dialogue that brings you back to '80s and '90s films. Part of that is because the actors in these motion capture suits can genuinely express themselves through the CGI in this movie, and Quaritch is again a standout. He is highly charismatic in that evil marine role and seems to cherish playing it. Zoe Saldana also has a few standout scenes that cut to the core as she expresses anguish, sadness, and anger with unfeigned, ear-piercing cries. The best part of ""The Way of Water"" is easily the extended final act, culminating with a final battle between Sully and Quaritch.This final act is fantastic, and I smiled ear to ear both times I saw it in theaters. You get the payoff of the character development from our characters set up during the first two acts. The fight between Quaritch and Sully is impressive, leaving a soft cliffhanger and Colonel Quaritch's chapter open for future installments. Cameron crafted this final battle to mirror the thematic elements explored throughout the movie with belonging and family. It was fantastic to see the parents and children taking turns saving each other. I won't go into too many spoilers, but I will rewatch the final hour of this movie on repeat at home, a la ""Avengers: Endgame,"" while I anticipate Avatar 3 in 2024. In short, this movie is a visual spectacle with a more personal and compelling plot than the first while setting up the future of this original franchise. In a world full of soft reboots and remakes, it is great whenever we do get original content instead of recycled IPs. While it is too early to say if Cameron's ""Avatar"" franchise will ever reach the same magnitude as ""Star Wars"" or ""The Lord of the Rings"" in pop culture, the early financial returns suggest Cameron might break their records anyway. Just ten days after release, the film already passed $1 billion box office gross, which bodes well for this franchise's future. ""Avatar: the Way of Water"" is an experience worth having in IMAX 3D, but unlike ""Avatar,"" it will be a movie I rewatch at home too. 9/10."
"Editing - very bad, let's hope this will be fixed in final cut. Pacing issues. Irritating teenagers, irritating teenagers, irritating teenagers, irritating teenagers, I think I made my point. Incredibly predictable plot, Avatar 1 is The Godfather in comparison, and they had at least 10 years to write it!It should've been a smaller in scale movie, with a few characters, Kiri and definitely not Spider. ANd the clifhnager would've been humans coming back, seriously, humans in this film are pure evil, not a single good human.Beautiful trash, except Kiri, her story had a plot.And it's too goddamn turquoise."
"This was a long and boring film that relied too heavily on looking good without any depth to the story. Frankly the main plot felt more suited to a side story which focused on humans 'calming the natives' to exploit resources, but it actually was more about revenge between the old general from this first Avatar and Jake Sully the rogue soldier. During the film I did start to wonder whether the sky people's (aka humans) military would be happy with pouring this amount of funding into killing one rogue soldier. Honestly I don't think they would, when they can just nuke everyone.The film was as expected filled with over the top sentimentality, but at such a level that I stopped caring about the characters. I also felt the film showed conflicting messages regarding gender. Action scenes showed strong female characters but dialogue re enforces male and female stereotypes of male protector and female carer.The actions scenes were brilliantly constructed but very fast to the point where the 3D visuals couldn't keep up and you ended up just watching a blur which was disappointing.At over 3 hours long narrating a thin plot line I felt the film could easily have been 2 hours without losing anything of value. It was all very indulgent to the creators and at one point I wondered if I was watching an episode of Blue Planet.Honestly, stay at home and watch something else instead. The 3D is nowhere near as good as the first film because its trying too hard. At one point during the film I wondered what it would be like to watch if you suffer from migraines. I fear it would bring one on or at the very least leave you wishing you'd done something else with your time. Cleaning the bins is more preferable, harsh? Yep."
"Whoever deluded h**self that any subsequent movie could surprise h** as much as the first one, is in for another surprise. That's not to say that the movie is not exceedingly and jawdroppingly enjoyable, just don't go in expecting to be re-introduced to this universe, that's all said and done in the first one.This is your second tour to the planet, so treat it as such. This is the after. What else could you expect other than ""life goes on"".Storywise, yes, it is a bit weaker, and the family ""good"" trope is really the only thing that bothered me throughout, both in the context that the Navi tribes do not operate in such a tight familial manner, and of course by my cynical view on the holiness of families.In any case, go see it, if anything, it is money well spent."
"Stunning Visuals and creative screenplay will keep you engaged though it has a normal storyline . Didn't feel the run time anywhere. Totally focussed on every single shot of the film.Positives : Visuals Overall, Sound design, Creative ideas, Last 45 mins,Negatives : Nothing to complain about apart from the simple story line. Villain could have been strong.On all aspects from the beginning to the end I never felt bored anywhere . I don't wanna compare this with the first part either. This Way of Water was totally Fresh to watch.Overall Verdict : Go and Enjoy this Way of Water for it's mindblowing and creative visuals."
"The first Avatar filled me with love for the dreamlike forest scenes in 3D and the message that we should cherish nature, but Avatar 2 did nothing for me. It's like a Starwars combat in Vietnam with NatGeo in the background and a bit of Titanic crammed in at the end. I did enjoy the visuals, but half an hour would have been enough to tell this story. There was no emotional attachment to the characters either. It baffles me why one person dies and another one doesn't, unless the sole aim of the film is to cram out Avatar 3. What a shame such a lot of money is spent by someone who has nothing to tell."
Both the acting and special effects were great. I truly wanted to love this film... except... I honestly felt like I was watching a StarWars movie where all the 'bad guys' couldn't hit anything (aka the stormtrooper meme) and ever shot from the 'good guys' always hit the mark. That is just bad writing. Out of the thousands of rounds fired by the 'evil humans' there was only 1 bullet that actually hit someone. I never thought Mr. Cameron would allow something so ridiculous like that to occur in one of his movies. I'm a huge fan of all things graced by Cameron and I'll definitely be watching the next film. Please don't let me down.
"James Cameron has done it again. This is not a movie this is an experience. I could not believe the world that I was living in. I felt like I was on Pandora. This movie moved me emotionally. I cried, I laughed, I was excited, and I was completely into it. Love the story and the characters. The action scenes are incredible and the underwater scenes make me feel like I was snorkeling on an alien planet with beautiful fish that you would never see on earth. I'm down for the cause of preserving the oceans! I rewatched the first one a few weeks ago and this one picks up several years after the first and moves the story along perfectly. Can't wait for the sequels! This is a must see in theaters. Saw it in IMAX 3D and was absolutely blown away!"
"Ok..beautiful visual and good action scenes, but thats all there was.The bad guy (colonel) went after Jake just for his personal vendetta and this was the only reason why all the action took place. Compared to the scale of things at stake in the first installment (Avatar), that is just weak and not very well founded.Too big part of the plot was dedicated to the childhood and puberty of the children, which was annoying. But apparently it was easier than creating a decent and credible plot around the grown up characters.The character I sympathized the most with was the whale. It was the only character with well explained motivation that was developing throughout the movie. Also contributed greatly to the action scenes."

"After 13 years, the 2009 billion-dollar hit Avatar has finally gotten its long-awaited sequel. Sequels can be complicated to make. If a film raises curiosity about what could happen next, it makes sense for a sequel to happen. The ending of Avatar fulfills this standard. While most people have been skeptical about Avatar: The Way of Water's potential success, my viewing of the film convinced me that there are plenty of good reasons why it deserves recognition.While the tone and genre are the same as in the previous movie, the premise is fresh. Avatar: The Way of Water has a fair balance of old and new elements. Even if the concept is familiar, James Cameron applies new themes to tack onto the story and characters.Prominent themes in the film include family, emigration, racism, and trust. Like the first film, the sequel shows how destructive war can be. However, this film sparks the conversation about invading another nation and the violent tactics used during an invasion. Another message I liked was how it's good for children to guide their parents rather than always just the other way around. Each generation has its differences regarding values and beliefs, which makes it challenging for Jake and Neytiri to trust their children. Fortunately, they learn to build their trust. Cameron manages to take the characters forward with their journeys, both story-wise and with character arcs. Even with characters that died in the previous film, they are not forgotten in the sequel. I was initially skeptical about Miles Quaritch returning after Neytiri killed him at the end of the first film, but I think The Way of Water did a good job handling his resurrection. Well actually, he doesn't entirely return in this film. His memories have been implanted into the body of a Na'vi, which was an exciting concept. New characters like Jake and Neytiri's children were well-written. Spider was a cool and likable character. It was also interesting to see the film expand on the Avatar universe by introducing the Metkayina clan and displaying the beautiful underwater creatures and lifeforms.The visual effects and cinematography are just as stunning as they were in the first film; they have the potential to earn Oscar nominations. The underwater sequences were both gazing and astonishing. The film has lots of exciting and satisfying action sequences. There were plenty of moments in the movie that were intense and emotional, which were well-made thanks to James Cameron's excellent direction.While it's sad that James Horner didn't get to compose this film, his replacement Simon Franglen did a fantastic job. I loved The Weeknd's song in the end credits.In addition to the characters, the performances are excellent, although I'm mixed about Sigourney Weaver playing Kiri. She's the daughter of the late Dr. Grace Augustine, whom Weaver played in the original film, so it makes sense for her to play the role. But still, Weaver is 73. While they could've kept Weaver's facial recognition for motion capture, a younger voice actress would have been more convincing.The biggest complaint the film is going to receive is its three-hour runtime. A long runtime can only be forgivable if the film uses that time wisely and provides enough content to keep the audience engaged. I believe Avatar: The Way of Water accomplished that. If the storyline and character arcs are essential, the film must take its time. While the beginning was a little rushed, the rest of the film had a good pace.Overall, Avatar: The Way of Water makes a good sequel, and it was definitely worth the wait. I look forward to the subsequent sequels to witness the continuing journey of our heroes and villains, as well as the expansion of the Avatar universe. The big screen will be the best way to view this film. You can see it in 3D if you want to capture the extraordinary experience; otherwise, Dolby or IMAX are good alternatives. Either way, you'll have a fun experience with this action-packed sci-fi film with excellent storytelling."
"Spoiler alert. We found the mammal killings and non-stop militant cruel behavior not appropriate for young children. The scruffy human men in boats did not fit in. Did they run out out of costumes ? Abit harder to follow the plot than the first one, for example, the existence of the General could have been explained better. When there's so much focus on the special effects, than the plot suffers. In this time of endless shootings, it would be better not harping on that theme. If you could take alot of that out, than it could have played in a reasonable time. 3 hours 12 mins ? Really ? The trailers don't focus on what we're describing. Thumbs down."
"Visually stunning. I can only imagine that in 2D or on TV, this would be a steaming pile of turgid nonsense, but on the big screen in 3D, there's little time to get bored as you get lost in the amazing - honestly amazing - visuals. Unfortunately, that's all it really has going for it. It's a nonsensical movie really, nothing of what happens makes any sense or progresses the Avatar universe in any meaningful way. I'll watch the sequels but, like the first, this was a one-time only viewing for me. I'd love for James Cameron to have a fraction of the budgets he has and look back to Terminator/Aliens for some new ideas about plots & characters."
"This wonderful film is worth going to this masterpiece just for the sake of new technologies. I was personally captured by a feeling of euphoria, but before that I was in a very bad mood... This is an unforgettable and vivid adventure. People have been waiting for this happiness for 12 years... I can say that we did not wait in vain. I advise you to go to this masterpiece only with a large company, so that after the session there would be someone to discuss it with. My score is 10 out of 10 and we are going to go a second time... Enjoy your viewing. We've been waiting so long. Let's just go and see for ourselves, with our own eyes."
"I had certain expectations coming into this movie. I did not expect a great story, as the first installment didn't exactly bring anything new to the table. What it did bring was revolutionary visual effects. Mind you, it was still ropey in parts, but it was undeniably beautiful. After 13 years, you would think they'd have perfected it. Nope! There were some nice looking underwater sequences, but beyond that, this movie felt like watching a video game cutscene.The worst culprit had to be the character models. They ranged from the uncanny valley to goofily disproportionate caricatures. They had to, because no one would be able to tell them apart otherwise. Which one of Jake's two sons died at the end? I have no clue, do you?How about the story? It was probably worse than the original, and that is saying something. ""Avatar"" (2009) at least had something to say, but the stakes in this sequel were way too low. Take the antagonists, for example. They went from on-the-nose, nevertheless timely depictions of cooperate greed and military colonialism. In 2022 they turned them into a few jug heads looking for revenge. They barely even had any motivations. You want revenge on a guy that is actively avoiding conflict and has retired on a distant beach somewhere? He didn't even care that you kidnapped his Tarzan looking kid. You all were in the clear! Why would you risk all your men and resources for that pointless cause? I hate these villains, not because they're evil, but because they're stupid.The plot did not manage well either. There was so much filler, pointless scenes that did not go anywhere. Were they ever going to explain the miraculous conception at the beginning? Or don't you think Chekhov's epilepsy should come into play later? I don't even like Chekhov, but this movie made me agree with him. I understand why they did not give too many answers. They were trying to set up the sequels, but 3 hrs and 12 minutes of set-up doesn't exactly entice me to see another one. Oh, did I mention it was 3 hrs and 12 minutes? I typically don't mind length, as long as it's used well (teehee), but this one certainly wasn't. It is actually 30 minutes longer than the first, an already weighty movie in its own right. That justifiably should induce a groan from most people.By far the worst aspect of this film is its characters. Jake Sully was never a good protagonist. His wife, Neytiri, is far more interesting to follow, and yet she felt shelved. Most of the best characters and actors were shelved. For example, have you tried picking Kate Winslet out from the crowd? It's tough. Instead, much of the screen time went to the more undesirable characters, such as the idiotic antagonists or a very obnoxious (and very goofy looking) prepubescent Na'vi child.Also, why did they have to resurrect half the deceased characters? That is always a cheap move, and frankly, Cameron did not do it well. Nothing justified the Colonel and his loyalists cloning their memories to put into poorly digitally rendered avatars. Why not just introduce a new villain like all the better written sequels out there? Sigourney Weaver ""technically"" played a different character than her first one, yet you could tell it was just her trying to pass as a teenager... And ""try"" she did... With the voice and mannerisms of a 70+ year old woman.Look, this is not just a bad movie, it is a disappointing movie. The first one was an anomaly. It was a subpar product, too expensive, yet it made more money than the world had ever seen before. This followup had a golden opportunity to take advantage of that, make something special without the risk of failing, and yet they seemed to go backwards in quality while still raking in ungodly amounts of cash.You can choose to listen to me or not, but I believe we need better standards for the cinema we spend our money on, not just some green screen action films, but something with substance. ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" was far from that."
"I went to watch it thinking it would be something very similar to 2009, but this film surprised me because it brings another perspective within the context that we live in the world today. It is a family must see, and the experience is even bettwr if seen in Imax 3D. Because the experience is fully immersive from start to finish I felt inside Pandora and the Way of Water. You will see 3D underwater images that we have never seen before: undistorted, flat, sharp from corner to corner, wide and immersive - from start to finish. Like never before. Avatar The Way of Water will once again change the history of cinema. Its mind-blowing images and amazing frame after frame."
"I cannot believe what I have watched. Watching this movie in 3D IMAX was one of the best movie experiences since interstellar. This was the most immersive movie i have ever watched. The visuals are pretty much photo realistic. There is no questioning that you are watching real characters. Its insane how realistic this movie felt. There was no moment where i thought it was uncanny. I am a person who is easily impressed by visuals and that is the reason for 10 stars. The plot is more like a 8, not bad but not ground breaking. But I didn't buy a an IMAX movie ticket for a ground breaking plot. I came for the best visual masterpiece I have ever seen."
"I was taken to the cinema to see this as a birthday present and wasn't expecting to like the 3 hour epic long film. I had enjoyed the first, but it was because of the new technology which at the time clew me away. But so many years after the original I couldn't imagine how they would hold my attention.But the gentle story telling and beautiful visuals kept me captivated. The story about respecting the life of sea creatures and respecting their intelligence and right to life was right on trend.The overall theme is about respecting this imaginary planet and the precious echo system on it. It's a lesson everyone needs - and so a massive hit for me."
"When I walked into the theatre I genuinely had high expectations from Avatar : The Way of Water. Well, the films does not disappoints me in the action department or visual department but the plot of the film felt like too basic for a James Cameron movie.+ves : As expected, it was a larger than life experience watching Avatar in 3D. Direction was amazing. Action sequences were well shot much better than the first one. VFX, CGI & BGM were bang one. I felt as if I was right there in Pandora with those Navis. I loved the characters of Kiri & Spider.-ves : The length of the film was a major negative or turn off for me in this movie. I felt as they were just trying to drag things. Especially those repeated sequences of Little Sully with that Tulkun. 30-35 mins of the movie can be easily chopped. Screenplay was way too slow considering it's a 2022 movie. Next thing is introducing lot of new characters. Although I loved some of those characters, but its shifts our entire focus from the main protagonist, Jake Sully. Unlike the first part, Jake Sully has just been limited to the Climax of the film. That took the main focus of the audience away from Sully. Moreover, in the first part, whenever Col. Miles Quaritch came on screen, he had his own aura which always felt dreadful. But in this sequel, that has not been the case. As a result, we don't feel that tension & rivalry during the final faceoff. Moreover, another thing which I heavily criticized in Jurassic Park : Dominion was that the movie had no proper ending. Same is the case with this film. At the end, things went back to Ground Zero. So it felt like I just wasted 3hrs 10mins on watching a motion ride having no proper ending. I know that they are keeping some things for the upcoming instalments of Avatar, but still they could have tried to make its end a bit meaningful. For Example, killing Colonel & bringing a new Villain who's more powerful etc. Like Marvel maybe. I do not know, that my own opinion however you can differ.To conclude, I would say go and watch it as you could only enjoy it in a theatre. Witness the glory of Navis but don't forget that this movie requires a lot of patience especially during 1hr to 2hr time slot."
"Wow. Just wow. This movie was even more visually stunning than the first. The water just made for an even better visual experience. The story was good but not great, much like the orinal. But this one and the original are by far the two best movie experiences of my life. I'm sure it will ""just"" be an 8/10 when I watch it at home but this is a must see at the theater / cinema. I could say the movie could have been 30 min shorter for a better story but it was the perfect length for the type of movie this is- a visual masterpiece that benefits from long visual scenes. At least three times I raised my hand to block something on the screen - my brain thought there was something in front of me to move away. Seeing the original when it eas released a couple of months ago and then seeing this soon afterwards made it easy for me to see how much it improved on already a great visual movie! The original is still in 2022 when rereleased better visually than any movie ever until part 2."
"The visuals are great, but the story is dull and it stretches for way too long. The story is also not self-contained, it takes time to understand everything if you haven't watched the first. What do humans really want? Just personal vendetta? Not interested in the planet anymore? Excellent execution of a money machine, with little effort however to invest in the story. The usual emphasis on family makes the movie even more predictable and uninteresting. Why do we need a third episode? It will be a challenge to stretch the story even further. Good movie for kids and teenagers, must be watched in 3D in the cinema."
"The animation was great with beautiful flora and fauna.The new water scenery is an interesting setting for the film. The immersiveness in 3D was impressive.Unfortunately, the plot couldn't keep up with the artistic and technical aspects of the movie.Humankind launches a new attack against the Na'vi after they got defeated last time. The attack is not just out of sheer greed this time, but because they destroyed their livelihood on planet Earth. The goal of the human army is to kill Jake Sully, a leader of the Na'vi.The humans don't have upgraded war gear with them for their second invasion attempt, and quickly in the film they must face a defeat when their railroad gets destroyed and a plane is shot down by an arrow. A scouting squad with children of Jake Sully pursues a group of attackers and gets into trouble. Jake and his wife are able to rescue them and he decides to prioritize the safety of his family over the war with the humans, resigns as leader and hides with the sea peoples of Pandora.From now on, killing Jake is no longer a viable strategic goal for the success of the invasion, and yet that's what the story is all about. The humans commit hostilities with the Na'vi and create multiple hostage crises. They make empty threats and lack every aspect of successful combat due to inferior speed, range, accuracy, and firepower. Members of Jake's family are taken hostage, they fight to free them, are taken hostage and so on.In the end, the human attackers lost hundreds of people and only managed to kill a single Na'vi."
"Seriously I never rated any movie 10 from 10 but this movie it is more than 3 hours and honestly I did not even felt the 3 hours, I swear I was sitting and just shocked from the beauty of this movie, the colors are so beautiful, the water is very beautiful, you feel your self one of them, you wish to join them, Seriously this movie succeed to make us wish to join their world, very good acting, nice and simple story, the director didn't focus on making the story complicated and hard to understand, the director just wanted the watcher to enjoy a real cenima to enjoy the color and life, very good."
"After all the hype promising a better movie after Avatar 1, Avatar 2 was sort of a letdown.It seems that the only good thing about the movie was the visuals. But without a good story to back them up, visuals turn into a documentary.For the first half of the movie it was impossible to know where the story was headed. Only in the last quarter of the movie did things get interesting. In my opinion, the movie time could have been cut down by half, delivering a great story with amazing visual effects.I think James Cameron tried to do a Peter Jackson here with the 3-hour run time. But then Peter Jackson had Tolkien's story to back him up. There wasn't enough story to fill the three hours, so it dragged on for a long time.I know that the movie creators went to absurd lengths to generate the visual effects for this movie, hats off to them. I felt that they had been betrayed by the story writers however.Also, Cameron's obsession with drowning ships was patently obvious in the final scenes of the movie, not that that's a bad thing, just saying."
"James Cameron's Avatar: The Way of Water is what many who watch it would expect it to be. The film is visually breathtaking, with a a great soundtrack to acompany the often astounding underwater and flying sequences within the film. The CGI and motion capture, much like the first film, is the best of its time, from the lighting to the water glistening on the skin of the Navi to the subtle facial movements from all the characters. The great visuals and soundtrack added a lot to the action sequences which were enjoyable and made for a great spectacle.The world of pandora is vibrant and alive, in ways the pandora shown in this movie is better than what is seen in the first film since it keeps aspects of the original but also adds to it too. The world feels lived in, with different animals and also a different race of Navi who have been evolutionarily adapted to their enivronment. This adds to the intrest of the world greatly, especially knowing that this likely means there are different groups of Navi with their own culture and adaptations to their way of life, in this case, their way of water.The story is much like the 2009 Avatar film, it involves humans vs the alien race of the Navi, in The Way of Water, a similar story takes place, with Sam Worthington reprasing his role as Jake Sully, however, Sully now has four children resulting in him being less reckless and more concerned with proetecting his family and his sons, who are eager to prove themsleves to him and their peers. This is somewhat fustrating to watch as it feels like the story tellers delyaing the inevitable battle that will take place, in a way creating fasle conflict that is not needed.A problem that can be felt from the film is how it aims to do too much which perhaps stops the film from honing its core postive aspects. Becasue there are many new characters that are introduced a lot of time is needed to focus and flesh out the fresh faces while also focusing on the old ones too. This is to the detriment of the film as this contributes to the over three hour run time. The issue with the film being so long is the fact that it has many scenes that are unneeded and could have been removed in the edit. The story does have some apsects that are intriguing with some genuinely emotional moments, it is for the most part somewhat hollow though, but at times it does raise the question of imperialism, particuarly America's part in the world, not being limited to its past treatment of native Americans but also its conflicts in recent memory such as vietnam, Afghanistan or Iraq.The Way of Water feels a lot like the first Avatar film in terms of the quality of the visuals, the sound design and soundtrack as well as the story. Its not much better or worse than the first film. I can confidently say that if you liked and still like and enjoy thr first film, it is highley likely that you will enjoy this one too. The experience is much the same and should feel like treading down a simialr road. I would however, say that this film felt a little better, perhaps becasue there are less human scenes, which often felt like the worst parts of the first film."
"We left cinema after 40 minutes or so. 3D is impressive but the screenplay is sooo dumb. Starting from the beginning- people left, but no, we don't have to prepare for their come back, let's just make 4 children, have fun and then look very surprised when people came back.When leader left the village ""because people are hunting only him"", we decided that pretty picture can't compensate this dumbness.In addition, I had the same problem as with Planet of the Apes - all people are bad, but you can't associate yourself with the blue aliens, and don't really care if they all die. So right from the beginning it was just Meh."
"This movie has the makings of a great sequel but it feels like it doesn't know what it wants to be. The sky people return to Pandora but instead of getting a tale of the Navi fighting them back again, we just get a time lapse and the Navi and the sky people are both on Pandora again. How this wouldn't have been another planetary call to arms and battle fighting the sky people back off again I can only explain as wanting more sequels.Instead, we get the classic, ""in order to save our village and protect the family, we have to leave,"" line. How this ever makes sense is beyond me because unless you send them a postcard saying, ""hey we left our village, please leave them alone,"" how does that ever stop a villain from burning it to the ground to make sure you are not there? These actions are actually seen being used later at a different location.My main problem with this movie is it doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. Is it to show us the water tribes and what they can be? Is it to show us the strength of the Sully family? These two things seem to clash for the whole 3 hours leaving you not sure what you want. When they try to suck you into the life of the water, it is interrupted by progressing the Sully family being hunted story. When you feel like the hunt is getting to a climatic place, we are dropped back into learning about the ocean again. This might have worked but as others have said, the gaps between are filled with blatant retelling of the first movie reskinned for the first.Ultimately, the movie was good but I need more than good if the movie is going to be 3 hours. The length of this film hurt the story as it felt like there was a lot of bloat. We end the movie where we should have been at the start with Navi ready to fight the sky people off of their planet again. All in all, I guess that kind of makes this whole movie just filler."
"Such a good story has many possibilities of creative plots but ends up wasting all the efforts in trash drama. Never expected we will have to watch this daily soap drama in Pandora. Entire movie become garbage revenge plot which won't end here but will continue in the next part as well.Instead of showing humans as villain could have find some strange species or monsters. And to defeat that Waterworld came together with forest or something would have been way more interesting.They wanted to show kids in limelight but that thought made mess and drama in entire movie. No logic and no common sense at all. From all kids, only one followed rules and they killed his character. Kis sacrificed to save another kid but got killed. But then that saved kid rescued the villain so he could come back in the next part with revenge plot again. Does this make any sense? If you wanted to show revenge then you should have ended movie with a bang like a first part. End was so so.....Utterly disappointed with this grabgage plot.Other than animation there were nothing interesting."
"Considering that I am a deeply cynical and miserable person, I was reasonably impressed by Avatar 2 due to my inability to hate it entirely, despite my best efforts of course.I did not like the first Avatar movie. It felt far too much like a gimmick to me. And while the same can be said for the sequel which feels more like a soft reboot than anything else largely due to the pointless recap that consists as the film's first act, it's entirely different from the first in certain respects. They do say that history repeats itself and I think it's interesting if not impressive that Cameron has somehow found a way of resurrecting the ""Cinema of Attractions,"" for a modern audience.That's exactly what these films are to me; light shows at the circus that are fairly inoffensive with no real meaning behind them; they'll entertain you while you're looking right at them but they won't change you as a person regardless of how often you view them. The only real difference is this Kinetoscope gimmick actually lasts for over three hours instead of a couple of seconds.The biggest detractor of this film for me - which is the same issue I had with the first and that I will undoubtedly have with the sequels - is that this is not cinema. I completely understand that this is one man's passion project but my sitting down and watching a three hour long cutscene for a video game that is basically any picture you can find on the current generation of consoles, I find myself feeling disjointed from what I'm watching, and when you're watching something that's been computer generated (in other words something that's not there! - unreal - ) the verisimilitude is broken for me and I find it very hard to engage with it.That being said I did derive some enjoyment from this film irregardless of why I dislike this style of filmmaking. It is a marked improvement on the first even though the majority of the plot exists unnecessarily so the final battle can happen and Cameron gets to recreate the ending of Titanic (1997) on Pandora. You only really need to see the last half an hour of this movie because it's all that matters since the confrontation between Sully and Quaritch could have easily happened at the end of the first movie. It felt unnecessary to structure a whole movie around this since by the time the credits rolled, whether you got something out of the 'pretty pictures' or not, there was no development. The film ends in exactly the same fashion as the first. Nothing has changed.I don't care whether you like this or not, for a movie that many people have waited over a decade for, I don't think I'm being ignorant to say I expected more than a damp retread of the original. There was nothing new, nothing interesting, it just looked a bit more polished, yet this time round you've actually managed to waste the cast; Stephen Lang is once again the best part of an Avatar movie which is a testament to his abilities since you never see him physically in his human form; Sigourney Weaver is wasted in a dream sequence; and you never even see Sam Worthington. I'm not the biggest fan of the latter but it definitely feels as though he's been shafted.While there's certainly room to argue the effects make up for the film's drawbacks, what's hard to ignore is that the film's cinematography in particular suffers from the technology being used; there was only a handful of shots in the film that stuck out as being particularly gorgeous - which for a film as long as this one is, is quite disappointing. Unsurprisingly, however, most of these noteworthy shots occur during the final battle: there is a beautiful shot of Quartrich's avatar staring at the devastation of the Demonship, and a wonderful homage to Apocalypse Now (1979) as Jake Sully emerges from the water (eyes first) before confronting Quartrich.Cameron's distinct style is present in this film but it's so subtle that it's easy to miss. There is a great filmmaker behind the camera but he just bombards you for three hours with indistinguishable characters you don't care about, a plot you're already familiar with and it's just hard to justify this movie existing because it's just not unique enough from the first one to exist and or spawn more than one additional sequel. The Avatar films for me exist in a weird quantum realm where if you somehow manage to clip through the greater pictures of Cameron's filmography you end up in the Blue Hell of Pandora.And even then the visuals were pretty hit or miss for me; the Na'vi look awful in daylight, and while it could have been my investment in the final act, the Na'vi clearly look better in darkness and there was definitely additional detail added during the final confrontation that makes it the only watchable part of the movie for me - despite the fact it feels like the crescendo the first movie was building to.I have no interest in rewatching Avatar (2009) and to be truthful I can't say I'll come back to The Way of Water, nevertheless, whether I saw the movie on TV or just felt like going out of my way for it, I would 100% watch that final act again, because it just is that good - I only wish I could say the same for the rest of the film and it does worry me about the content of future movies since I really can't see what they're going to do in future if Cameron remains determined to keep making these films of epic length.The film is definitely flawed (which I considerately will put down to the fact that such a large period of time has elapsed between these two films) and the style doesn't really make up for it, but the appeal of limited character development in the final act does make this film superior to the first and I'm sure the general consensus will lap up this movie. But it's not for me brother, and I'm more or less okay with that, though I will resent being dragged by my flatmates to watch further Avatar movies.I cannot fathom what anyone would have wanted from an Avatar sequel and I don't seem particularly nostalgic for 2009 but for people who are actually fans of the original I'm sure you won't be disappointed.Nevertheless, to me, this was just another sideshow attraction that I've already largely forgotten about."
"This movie takes you into a totally innovative world. At first this movie creates the feeling of disappointment because the visual effects are similar to a video game. Once you get used to it, this story takes you into a world where ""humans"" are closely related to nature. James Cameron fails to impress with the storyline because this sequel is typical for a movie franchise. As we are used to, James Cameron brings a new perspective on the visual effects through which he succeeds in revolutionizing the cinematographic world. In conclusion, the film deserves to be seen in a cinema because of the ingenuity of the images as well as for the story, which in my opinion becomes a bit commercial because of the ending that gives James Cameron the opportunity to make a sequel to this movie."
"Visually stunning. Long? Yes. Too long? Likely. Just so many common sense questions even while watching the film. Why does Spider help the humans? Why is he surprised by their ruthless actions? If people can go into Avatar bodies ( seemingly even after death), why would they go to the trouble of harvesting ""whale brain juice"" to stop you aging in your possibly old & feeble body? Why not kill Jake the so many they had a chance to do so? Is not wanting a bow and arrow attack from the water people before the battle royale any kind of reasonable rationale not to shoot him when he is in your sights and doing so is literally their mission? It seemed that a whole bunch was going on and being discovered for humans being back on Pandora for just one year. Sigh.It seems like a very mediocre story with minimal thought for a decade plus hiatus. Setting up for the franchises future movies? Undoubtedly. But give your audience some credit and write a plot that meets some minimum common sense level and meets a threshold for integrity."
"Yash! This is good movie after Avatar 1 (2009) I like this story, cinematography & action. Avatar 2 is the best movie of the year, can't wait for the next Avatar. I like this movie if I watch on the big screeen & 3D format. Sound effect & Visual are so good and the best for kids & adults. Avatar 2 the way of water be the best animation movie & the best CGI since i watch. Good job for the te Team Avatar & Director thanks for making the best movie for us. We are love and big thanks for the actor on the movie. I need and can't wait for the next movie Avatar 3 on the 2 years soon. Thanks fot the attention guys!"
"Straight to the cinema screens, after a long break of 13 years we are going to Pandora.if you have not seen the first part, then the story of the film is being continued, and the film itself shows quite a lot of historical elements.the first part sets a very high bar for video effects and quality, the sequel is much ahead of it with highly detailed images and action scenes, the breadth of the story and the stories of the planet itself.the most worth watching in cinemas, even though the movie is very long, but I didn't get bored, when it comes to the story, it's similar to the first part according to the narration, but from the middle of the movie, everything just increases. I didn't get bored, and I couldn't count the number of screensavers on my fingers, so the movie absolutely surpasses everything I've seen on the cinema screen this year.I won't reveal the details, because it's worth seeing for yourself, the film presents at least 4 different stories that are very deeply connected, so you just have to get comfortable and enjoy. James keeps the bar high for himself, so I hope and wait not only for the 3rd film but also for the remaining two."
"Criticism:The good guys are super good and the bad guys are super bad and there is no morally grey area. The morally grey is where 100% of interesting character development occurs.This is how I see the writer's talking about the outline for the plot: ""let's make everything as simple as possible because the audience is just too stupid to comprehend nuance"". The dialogue was very bad at times and the acting was just as bad but only from one actor in particular. I saw it in 3D and now I know I don't like 3D.Praise:The plot although irritatingly simple it wasn't a complete deal breaker. Family values are so rarely seen on the big screen and that's one reason I rated this movie so high. Another reason is the special effects. Although I didn't like the 3D. Some of the visuals are so goddam beautiful I'm considering watching it again in regular IMAX.Final thoughts:I've seen three movies in the theaters in 15 years including this one and I'm thinking of seeing it again."
"The film is excellent in all technical and production aspects, part full of interesting stories. Avatar 2 is an upcoming American epic science fiction film directed by James Cameron and produced by 20th Century Studios.10 The film is the second in the Avatar series, after Avatar 2009. Jake Sully lives with his newly formed family on the planet Pandora. Once a familiar threat returns to end what had previously started, Jake must work with the Neytiri and the army of the Navi race to protect their planet. I watched the movie in 3D and it was a great experience. The release date of the film was good and before the new year, to have an excellent look with the star of the new year."
"I have watched Avatar 2009 over and over again, may be more than 20 times. I remember the scenes by heart, and still love it every time I watch. The surprise element is lost right after the first view. Yet, the story telling and visuals were captivating. Obviously the wait was a long one. 13 years made the expectation larger.So I had to watch ""The way of Water"" in 3D, and so I did. But almost a damp squib. The visuals were absolutely amazing. No one can use technology as good as Cameron. But 13 years of development in technology didn't really show. Rather I would say, Avatar-1 was as good.The script was not anything close to Avatar-1. It was just an okay script. But the story telling was not good enough. The story focused heavily on the children. But the movie could not establish a relationship of the audience with those children. This is where Avatar-1 scores well. The audience connected with jake and his narratives 13 years ago. But this one fails to establish any such connection."
"I loved the first Avatar movie - it was groundbreaking at the time with absolutely stunning visuals. Pleased to say that the visuals on this sequel are just as stunning if not more so but there is an over reliance on these to carry the lengthy 3 and a bit hour runtime because the storyline is somewhat lacking. Can't help feeling that there should have been a better story to tell here other than the basic 'find Jake Sully' story we have here given the potential of the world of Pandora. Having said that, the action scenes are once again jaw dropping - watched it in 3D and sometimes it was difficult to decide what to look at! Some of the dialogue is a bit dodgy too (would Jake's kids who grew up on Pandora really be talking like that?!). Overall though a good movie and I'll definitely be going to see the next one."
"Despite going in with some initial reservations of it living up to the previous film over a decade ago, I left the cinema feeling extremely satisfied and felt like the time had paid off.Although there are some things that felt off, it all actually made sense the more I thought on it and the way they reintroduced characters and showed new characters felt fluid and organic, and really shows how the gap in films doesn't hinder it at all.Ultimately, it captures the exact themes it was going for, and even builds on the previous film in a strong way. My only disappointment is that it is over and I'll have to wait for the next one."
"The Way of Water is an ok movie, but didn't blow me away like the first movie did. Cameron went quite safe on this one. It feels repetitive from the first movie at multiple points, and the story is reasonable but completely predictable if not downright boring.Don't take me wrong. I love Avatar. I love Pandora. I have watched the first movie countless times and waited so long for the sequal. Maybe I had my expectations too high because Cameron is known to produce very good sequals (e.g. Terminator, Aliens, etc.), which is kinda rare talent.The Way of Water has mesmerizing visuals, and Cameron uses 3D to good effect as always.Unfortunately, the new characters are boring. Each of the kids fills a very typical role, and they have a typical teenager trouble with their parents, Jake and Ney'tiri. Quaritch is the most interesting one here, but even that is still under development.The original was much better polished as a stand-alone movie. For good or bad, the Way of Water is embedded in the expanded franchise. Can't wait to see the full story arc unfold in the coming sequals."
"Really cannot complain about this movie at all. 12-13 years in the making and the visuals were just extraordinary. I Went to see this movie twice and the second time in 3D which i must say was a completely different breathtaking experience.I see a lot of people complain about the story and plot of the film but i don't think it was that awful, yes it was a simple premise and in a way maybe a somewhat predictable outcome but for the most part it had strong messages for viewers as well as being a very emotional movie which from what i saw had half the theatre tearing up.The performances were also incredible with a very special mention to Zoe Saldana who really, really shined in her performance considering she was being motion tracked. The sound of the movie was also absolutely amazing and the overall immersiveness of this movie was spectacular.In Conclusion the movies visuals really compensate for any small faults that you may believe the movie has, it will really make you forgot that Pandora doesn't exist. James Cameron once again outdone himself."
"Ok, so it doesn't have the depth of films from the 70's and 80's and it certainly can't be rated for on screen acting performances. But the film, certainly in IMAX 3D was simply stunning. 3 hours passed by easily, drawn in to the world and water around the characters. I was worried reading it was the same story as 1 and whilst it kind of was, it gained so much more with the addition of water and the battle scenes were jaw dropping at times. Pathos and horror in the odd scene, what man does to other creatures. And it hit the emotions way more than an avengers film would ever do. I just enjoyed it for what it was. A dip into a beautiful world and a story that I just enjoyed following."
"First of all: Before watching this movie I was afraid I'm gonna be disappointed after that, so it's not a bad thing, that Cameron met my expectation in almost 100%. This is the same level as the first movie, it's almost impossible to choose between them... But if I had to, I would choose this one. Why?About 80% of the whole movie is almost the same as its predecessor's. Humans are bad again, Pandora is beautiful and stunning again, the whole plot is nothing very complex again, dialogues are not that well-written and some of them are cheesy AGAIN. So, what are the differences?First of all,here are much more characters here and I like them more. The main character and the main villain change only slightly, but I still aprecciate that. All the children here are possibly the most complex characters and their journeys are really engaging.Second of all, there are a few really moving moments and they hit me much harder than any scene like that in the first ""Avatar"".But the most important difference and the biggest advantage of this movie is learning about a new culture and that's fascinating. I know we got this in the first one, but here it's explored in much better and complex way. At least in my opinion.All that sea animals and everything we know about them... I loved it immediately and I won't stop soon."
"As I went into the theatre, I was expecting a hell of a visual treat. I wasn't disappointed, and in IMAX. No one would be I imagine.As for the story and rhythm of the film, there are many elements from the first film that have been reused, just in another setting, and have been added to what's new in The Way of Water, which made me feel that this sequel isn't as balanced as the first film and gave me the impression that it dragged longer than it should have.Apart from all that, we know that the main themes of Avatar revolve around the ideas of invasion, colonisation, resistance, protecting what's ours and the interactions that will ultimately occur between the invader and the invaded.The Way of Water develops on those concepts, if only they were better presented here."
"As expected from the sequel of the revolutionary first part of the Avatar franchise, this movie is visually magnificent. It is generally considered hard to display the beauty of underwater shots, and this movie simply delivers in the best way possible. The story is highly predictable and riddled with plot holes though, a problem shared by the previous part. The movie is not a one time watch, not because of the excellent story, but because of the eye candy shots that surpass almost everything else in the market. The message that the movie tries to deliver gets preachy and overly simplistic at times. Still, this is a must watch for everyone who likes to watch the water splash."
"I wasn't expecting too much for this, and studiously avoided the trailers wherever possible.Initially, I watched it and gave it 8.5, but then watched it a second time, and noticed even more of how brilliantly it has been made (script/effects/technology/etc), and it's a worthy 10/10. The 3 hours 15 min doesn't drag... you don't realise how long it is while you are watching it.Definitely some major surprises in the story, which was great.I've been trying to think of negatives, even little one's... and the only thing I can think of is a certain decision 'Miles' makes near the end, which baffles me.Can't wait for the next instalment. Thanks James and Co!"
"Both avatar 1 and 2 have been very fun, amazing to look at cinematic experiences. It is an enjoyable ride and emerses the viewer into a dreamworld that is Pandora. There are many things to like and enjoy here.The problem is, I came away noticing some important things that are missing.First, other than Sully and Neytiri, the character pool is very small. We've just been introduced to the children but most quality universes like star wars or lord of the rings give you a great lineup of characters to invest in and care about. This is lacking hereNext, the plot and motives are all over-hashed cliches, just done with fancy scenery. Jaws meets Titanic meets Poseidon meets any other movie about rebels facing a tyrant. There's nothing original here in the way of direction.Finally, where is this all going? These two movies feel like copies of each other. Are we getting 7 movies of battling over resources against the same generic enemies? That's what shows like the walking dead got wrong; you take down one group of people and then next season it's the same thing all over again with a new group.We need to take the story off of just pandora or introduce an interesting twist or direction. Expand the scope. This movie had zero surprises or plot twists...I want to like it, but it's lacking in all the important places."
"I'm serious for a movie that was 3 hours long it did not feel like 3 hours long at all. From the very beginning it seemed interesting every single part of the movie was completely necessary to whole plot. (SPOILERS AHEAD)
Jake sully and his wife and children felt like they were actually apart of his real family and it felt real. They did a amazing job at acting when the brother died in the movie and I actually got teary eyed. I usually don't cry during movies but it was so well put together that I ended up shedding a tear. Overall I can't wait for the next avatar and I can' believe they put back some of the old crew that died in the other movie back into this movie."
"Movies are typically shot and displayed at a frame rate of 24 fps, but some movies, including Avatar 2, have used higher frame rates of 48 or 60 fps. Using a higher frame rate can create a more realistic and immersive viewing experience, as the increased number of frames can make the action on screen appear smoother and more realistic. Believe it or not, it's a mind-blowing experience that I loved and love.James Cameron is known for pushing the technical limits in his movies, and Avatar 2 is no exception:He used high frame rate (HFR) technology in Avatar 2.The movie also featured groundbreaking motion capture work for the Na'vi characters.Cameron used a combination of practical and digital effects to create the creatures and environments of Pandora.The level of detail and realism achieved in the special effects is impressive.The story is straightforward In Pandora's world, Jake Sully is undecided between his loyalty to his own family and his duty to protect the Na'vi. Protecting his family and protecting the oceans are James Cameroon's concerns on Avatar 2.The actors' work was hilarious, particularly for the underwater shooting (many scenes were shot underwater in a very large pool made exclusively). Comedians learn new respiratory skills: 7.15 minutes for Kate Winslet (Ronal) and 6.5 minutes for Sigourney Weaver (Kiri).The technology behind Avatar 2 is breathtaking, for example: In underwater scenes, they used multiple motion capture cameras (Mocap cameras). James Cameroun has developed a device called THE DEEP X 3D. Which weighs less than 30 kilos and can be handled by one person and the actors themselves they wear a GoPro action camera.The Spirituality in Avatar 2 is too powerful, one can feel it and experience it during the 3-hour show. Neural tendrills help NA'VI connect to animals and land and even EYWA. How do we connect profoundly to ourselves and the natural world that surrounds us? With the connection of the divine anything can be accomplished. ""All energy is lent and that one day it has to be returned"", this sentence was said in the two films of Avatar and resume everything. All life is loaned and that one day must be given back to the divine."
"The movie was tiring, too long boring story and special effects don't seem to be very good either. At least the opening scene with the Maglev train jumping into the air. The train looks like a toy.The movie was tiring, too long boring story and special effects don't seem to be very good either. At least the opening scene with the Maglev train jumping into the air.

"It's a bunch of hype. The first avatar was decent especially with the graphics. In comparison this one graphics were ok but it seems the same as 15 years ago .so I won't even say it was visually stunning or great just good for today, not the future. Now to the bad. The story sucks, its too long (3 hrs plus), it's annoying. Literally who wants to watch a bunch of unruly teens who have no real acting parts who are constantly YELLING with surround sound. Next The parents are stupid, dad being less stupid and annoying. Mom is a typical steroype of minority woman who does ahit all but YELL HYSTERICALLY. Horribly annoying for 3 hrs."
"It s been a while since I have seen a good feel factor movie in a cinema. Avatar 2 made me cry, kept me in suspense, and I was entertained 100%. I left the cinema, feeling good, complete and happy. The movie is for all, you can not like this movie.Some viewers have specified that the story line is too weak, but I assure you that this movie has a story, and a story that is suited just for the movie it self. Avatar 2 represent everyrthing that is needed in today's cinema, and that is, pleasure and joy.I have seen Avatar 2 in 3d version, which wasa good decision, and I felt I was living, breathing and experiencing life of that planet.Thank you to all the actors and the crew, thank you, James Cameron."
"This film was absolutely amazing, the emotions throughout were unlike any film I've seen before. I felt happy, sad, tense, excited and so much more. I am confused as to how many negative reviews this has as me and my friends absolutely loved it, we can't wait to see the next film, thank goodness the wait wont be as long!The visuals are stunning, the story is amazing and leaves room to grow. The new characters and environment adds both depth and diversity to the story line.I think some people just like to see the worst parts of everything while disregarding the good. If you are thinking about watching it go for it! I know im going at least two more times ;)"
"Avatar is a CGI dream world, we fell in love with the world maybe a little more then we fell in love with the characters. We finally get to experience the second one, only to get very little of the jungle world which we fell in love with. Instead we get a movie that is mostly trapped in the land of Seaworld instead of Avatar. Am I the only person who missed the jungle? Every line from the characters were well acted, but I had to chuckle with many lines that seem to have come out of a Shamu Seaworld show about saving aquatic or indigenous life, mixed with a reverse Moby Dick story near the end. It was sad to see Sully, who was beginning to look like a complicated character, unfolding in to an overprotective & dicky dad in this second film. Some of the new elements were added to this film started to work in the beginning, but then I kinda lost them along the way. Many of the new creatures were cool, yes, but the plot was pretty simplistic. I found myself wanting to get lost in the world more then I wanted to hear Sully again beat down his son, for the third time. Now, I must say, how about that ending? After Spider rescued him, I started to wonder if there was a interesting redemptive character arch for the Colonel, only to arrive at the conclusion, nothing was actually accomplished in this film. We are left to guessing until another many years what his fate will be. I left the theater wondering if the Navi actually gained anything in this movie. The main antagonist was rescued, their water land villages burned, (spoiler free) they lost something very dear to them. Whales decimated. Oddly, this sequel has a weird background of dispair too it, for a movie that is ""family friendly"". All that to say that this movie, in my opinion doesn't deserve the masterpiece rating of 10/10 but it isn't a flop either. It is mostly a Disney Native American story. A sequal that is graphically beauty with a subliminal darkness, & a little bogged down with little character development. But hey, it's Avatar, not Sherlock Holmes. I think this movie fairly receives a 6 because it was filled with sparse character development and a lot of riding or embracing animals. 6/10 for some plot, mostly a Seaworld ride, & a animal embracing simulator."
"I just watched this movie with my partner and we both enjoyed, it ,it's fantastic, the graphics and everything are fantastic, this one and the 1st is like no other movie out there , James Cameron and crew did an amazing job, we can't wait for the others to come out. 1 and 2 are by far the best movies I've seen and are definitely my favourite , i understand why it took so long to come to the cinemas it was absolutely worth the wait all the actors did an amazing job , no other actors could have done it justice, it was fun watching it in 3D I love how one gets to feel like they are in the movie :)"
"One of the best movie released in 2022
Visually stunning and CGI is mind blowing
Such a great movie
Everybody must watch.Cameron gave attention to details and crafted this.Maybe I'm being a fanboy but even as a general critic I would say wonderful because the movie deserves that praise.3D experience background score everything is on point
Plot is engaging and giving a huge takeaway and teaching a big lesson on nature.It will satisfy children, adults and families in a huge way.Pandora is another universe where CGI lives at it best and story lives upto the nameEveryone go to the theatre and watch."
"The way to win hearts to the environmental cause is not through saccharine teen drama and sermonizing; as much as I might appreciate the impulse to care for the planet we have, this movie is a deeply flawed vehicle for that message. And that's what it is: a vehicle for a message, and for the demonstration of graphics technology, not a compelling story.I watched the original Avatar for the first time ever the night before seeing this one, and wasn't impressed---see my review there if you care for the details (a thing I certainly doubt.) Evil capitalism, evil evil military, those monsters are just so evil. I was expecting more of the same.In that department, I was partly impressed. Yes, we got the exact same villain back, but he was complicated by loyalty to his original version's son, causing him to waver in his plotly-unjustified quest for revenge. The Quaritch-Spider dynamic isn't amazing, but at least it's crossing the otherwise-absolute good/bad, black/white boundary, like a muted Vader and Luke. At least it made me feel something.I was holding out for that for the first two-thirds of the movie. Instead I found myself zoning out. Another pointless excursion in the water? How about we showcase the CGI looonger, maybe another act or two? We'll do the story after.Especially having just seen the first movie, it quickly became clear that this _was_ the first movie, translated from the forest to the ocean. When Jake Sully led his family into exile at the moment he should have been rallying resistance to the new human invasion, I knew we were in for a long digression, since the story so obviously wanted to go the other way. Which maybe was the point: I'm getting a strong whiff of the so-called Hobbit trilogy here, with light plot being stretched over... what's planned now? Five films?Which leads to derivative filler like the ""whale"" hunt, imitating Dune's sandworms but in the sea. The amrita must flow!Which leads me to a prophecy: #1 was the forest, #2 was the water, therefore each of #s 3-5 will take place in another biome. I'll go with desert, ice, fire. Everything else will be basically the same.The climax did work for me to a good degree. Just the drama of the sinking ship, the beauty of the flames on the water, and the pathos it was at least attempting to evoke. There was some beauty to it. Finally something was happening.But such a tiresome journey getting there. Never a moment to rest.The visuals were gorgeous, but who cares? They'll be obsoleted soon enough.Zoe Saldana's character might as well not have been in this, having completely merged with her mother role and faded into the background.I appreciate that the family portrayed was pretty functional, had a father present, and such.One more star than its predecessor, because there was a little bit of texture to the paper villain, one less because there wasn't much new to experience, and one more again because the finale kinda worked."
"Someone enjoyed creating all the CGI, but forgot about a reasonable plot. Hour two of the film seemed to forget there was even a plot with endless underwater swimming sequences rather than getting on with it. Needed to be faster moving for me and the small part for Sigourney Weaver added nothing other than minor sentimentality.All a bit predictable with some characters unsure if they were a cat or a Moirai warrior. Clearly the end was set for another sequel which will probably hit the screens in 2030.After such a long time in the making, the film as a whole was disappointing and generally forgettable. If they make a third film it needs to do much better than this one."
"The new Avatar has nothing to be compared with the old one. I mean James could have discuss some deeper topic in this pandora world like the future of humanity or any race who soar up into the space, the space war and the possibilities of establishing a sustainable way of live in our current system. Personal view from me is that since the pandora world has a 'planet brain' , the Eywa play the role of the 'manager' of the planet's life. And that's why the planet can keep an invisible and delicate balance in the world. Is that mean only if human race are ruled by a invisible manager which can invade our brain so that we are able to control our unstoppable growing desire, and obey the nature rule? Who we are if all the animals spirits are connected to the one big brain, the Eywa?In the modern society, all human race are discarding their believes to pursuit the ultimate freedom. People are so separated and have more fights than the last 500years. Can we always blame the disasters and the growing desire while we are so separated when chasing freedom and free spirit? The avatar movies display a utopia for us, but it didn't show how the inner side of the society work in the pandora system, and that's what I was only curious about. Anyways, it's not avatar II, it's just another lion king series but shot in the universe."
"First the 3d was amazing best way too see this movie,in in 3d..3d should be an Oscar category because few know how to do it well,This is not real science fiction this was cowboys and Indians movie just switched into big blue alien creatures,its a human drama with a space/futuristic setting ,All the same elements apply good guy/bad guy/ bad guy does wrong good guy guts justice ,its all the same hallmarks, family friendship children, revenge.its cowboys and Indians set in space...Saying that everytime the blue creatures mimicked native American ""yip yip yip"" I felt embarrassed .. Did anyone else notice that's not a alien creatures call that's Cherokee ,Really the writers get an big ""f"" for originality not to mention inappropriate cultural misappropriation ,Getting to the main plot,when the bad guy from the original move comes back as a cloned alien I wanted to leave really why...? Cant the writers think up another bad guy had to pull that one out of their asses ,The rest of the movie spiraled down to an sobbingly pathetic good guy bad guy dukem out ending ...3hrs later after i crawled out of the theater my 1st thought was ""Avatar 3 give us your money"""
"I realy liked the movie, the scenic views are great and the story is also good in my opinion. What I just can't stand is this horrible HFR..all the special effect scenes looks like a time lapse.to me because of HFR. They just look unrealistic..I know not everybody has this Problem when looking an HFR Movie, but me and some people I asked do. That realy ruins some scenes which surely would be great without HFR.I don't see any little advantage of HFR, so just hope the movie makers are stopping to go that way.Beacause it's not only a Problem of Avatar but of the whole film industry I give 9 of 10 stars anyway for a great movie."
"It's a fantastic movie with amazing graphics technology and fights, the underwater-world totally attracts you into their world. Couldn't be a better movie unlike other movies this movie also has a fantastic second movie. Adapting to the water clan they have to fase manny dangers. A recommendation!!!! If you have already seen the avatar 1, you have to check this out!!! (In the cinema on a big screen). This isn't just a good movie with creep graphics and designs, it's really a movie who you can't miss. Also it's a nice movie to watch with you're family or with friends. Even with younger kids it's fun.You really should watch the movie!!!!"
"Just got back from watching this at the cinema, and wanted to leave a review, James Cameron has done it again! Visually stunning! I watched it in 3D IMAX if you get the chance watch it definitely watch in 3D so you can appreciate the film at its fullest. Amazing effects nothing like I have seen before, I thought the characters that were introduced were brilliant especially the younger kids ( especially Kiri) I think there will be more of her to come and it was also very emotional at times, with family at the core of this movie, the girl next to me in the cinema, was crying a few times during the film, it was very moving. Don't miss out! I would say this is in my top 3 movies of 2022- A masterpiece. Well done to James Cameron and all the cast involved it was definitely worth the wait!"
"I just got out of seeing Avatar 2: The Way of Water in 3D, and holy crap I highly recommend seeing the movie in such a format, it truely is mind blowing, and my expectations are overwhelming satisfied with the film.Most people online before I had seen the film ranted about it and said some very negative things which really cut me off from the overall hype of this movie. But now that I have seen the spectacle itself I can happily say it is a perfect sequel to the 2009 Original film, and is as good as, if not better then most of the monster blockbusters dropped at our cinemas doorsteps this year.The movies first hour truely pulls you back into the stunning world of pandora and gets you up to date on the story and what has occurred between the events of the first movie and the events of the way of water. Once again James Cameron has upped his game and made the most remarkable visual masterpiece known to date, and has shown that the ten year development for the necessary technology required for this movie was 100% worth it.The Second hour of the film is really my only criticism, though it involved some of my favourite scenes. While I don't think the story dragged that much at all with it's huge 3 hours and 12 minutes run time, the middle of the movie did have alot of filler and events that I feel could've been cut down or even montaged in a way, saving the film from plenty of entertaining but somewhat unnecessary plot. But the two reasons I'm still hanging on board with the described by some 'excruciating' run time is due to the character development and beautiful world building in many key story moments.Now the final hour of the film is probably the most entertaining and probably one of the best 'wrap up's' to a movie I've ever seen. The final act was gut wrenching and emotional and performances by Zoe Zaldana and other actors and actresses truely stood out to me and even made me tear up at a point. I will not get into detail but the the final 'conflict' of this movie was truely a wonder.In conclusion Avatar: The Way of Water is probably the best follow up to the 2009 movie that I could ask for, and I am upset to see people online claiming they 'won't see this movie' or 'want it to flop', as a movie like this truely needs to break the box office charts. I was truely mesmerised by my experience and I know many others where to! And I am excited to see where the next 3 to however many sequels James Cameron has pinned to his wall play out, including the next generation game that reaches platforms supposedly early to late next year!I give Avatar: The Way of Water (9/10) stars
""A true wonder of story and sceptical"""
"I never understood the hype around the first movie. The visuals were great but everything else was kinda lackluster. Same with this one. Lots of people love it because of the visuals, which yeah they're amazing, but everything else lacks. The story is simple, and at some points bad, the character work makes no sense, and there is lots of bad acting. The only good ones really are Sam Worthington, Gamora, and Stephen Lang. The start of the movie gets right into the action, which can make it feel rushed at points which is weird because the movies like 3 hours long. The second act slows down, but I honestly enjoyed it. And then the third act is pure action and chaos, which again I enjoyed, but just because I enjoy something doesn't make it good. The final act is insanely messy and convoluted that it is hard to overlook. But anyways I thought it was an enjoyable movie that was mostly saved by visuals."
"It is films like this which make me think about the future of the film industry. What stories can be told no that were unimaginable before! This film will have you in awe for its entire run time. This is not without its flaws.Although visually stunning the story seems very safe which is typical for a block buster of this budget. This choice is understandable but it does hold it back from being on my best of all time list.Accompanying the stunning effects in this film, Cameron utilizes HFR for about 95% of the film. This adds to the moving going experience and shows you can tell a story on the big screen at a frame rate higher than 24 fps. However the change from HFR back to 24 fps is very jarring and pulled me straight out of the immersion the film does so well. Changing frame rate is nothing new to film but this time it is done poorly. 24 fps in action and dialogue and vice versa. There is no reason to change this much other than to make certain shots look more traditionally cinematic. I hope for the future films Cameron swings for the fences and keeps the HFR for the entire film."
"I watched the original for the first time a couple of weeks ago, and I found it too long for the very basic story that is being told, and quite boring. When my kids asked me to take them to the 2022 film, I was not too thrilled about spending another 3 hours watching Avatar, but I found myself pleasantly surprised. Again the story was very basic, and scenes that could have conveyed their point in a minute or two seemed to drag on for 10 minutes, but the step up in CGI 10 years later made the big visual scenes in these moments pretty cool. I cannot say that I would ever watch the film again, there just isn't much there, but the story is ok, the CGI is a big step up from the previous movie, and I feel like I had a decent bit of entertainment for my 3 hours."
"Can't say it's a great movie, still a must have theatrical experience. Story would have been a lot better. The way of water exploration is good, it could be great if it had a new story rather than just human and navi fight or we can say fight between sully and colonel). As all say Cameron's creation is great in terms of direction and making. Everything is great in the first movie, considering a sequel with highest budget this would have been a lot better. Didn't get that awesome feel the first movie gave. Still I have great hunger to see Pandora in the feature hope Cameron can make another great one."
"It's great to be back with James Cameron's greatest movie graphics everyone has ever seen, longer than Avengers Endgame, and The Batman. When I was watching this in IMAX 3D with my sister today, I was surprised about the frame rates that. We were treated to some epic action sequences, intriguing storylines, and beautiful animation, reminding me of the first Avatar history.When Quaritch has became a Na'vi to finally get his revenge on Jake after he thought Jake deceived him, there were a lot of battles and wars. Let's not forget how The Sky People and the Na'vi were fighting against each other to protect, about to kidnap Jake and Neytiri's kids, Spider who was recused by Jake and Neytiri, which I find out that Spider is like Quaritch's son, and finding a new clan, called the Metkayina to learn the sign language. We learned a lot new things in the Metkayinan culture, like communicating with animals, underwater exploring, and tons of new creatures around the clan.The one scene that made me bawl was when during the battle, where the RDA hurts the clan, while Neteyam was rescuing Lo'ak, Tsireya and Spider, he was shot. And when they got to the surface rock, he died, and I was shocked of Neytiri's mourn and despair seeing him perish, reminding me of the first Avatar movie when her father died during the Destruction of Hometree incident, even sadder than that.So I'll simply put, the graphics were stunning, the character designs and frame rates were perfect, the storylines & wars were dazzling & enchanting, and it has a tons of worlds to explore in life. I LOVED the movie, I totally LOVED it. I look forward to the third one soon! James Cameron was one of the best directors I know. :)"
"This film pushes the boundaries of what can be achieved with CGI and motion capture. Unlike many recent movies, the CGI in Avatar never once felt unrealistic to me. Throughout the entire viewing experience, I was fully immersed in the world presented to me, feeling as though it could be real. The visuals in this film are truly top-notch. However, the story falls short of being complex and unique. At times, it felt predictable, and like a rehashing of the first Avatar film, just in a different location.Despite this, I highly recommend experiencing this film in a theater, as it is truly a cinematic masterpiece!"
"I honestly don't get some of the hate the movie gets, I enjoyed it being a reviewer online I know everyone has different opinions on movies but I found it stunning, Some of the plot was repeated/reviewed from the last movie, but other wise I enjoyed it! The internet is certainly going to argue about options after this release. People just hating this movie to the core and people that love it. I love how the movie presented all the characters again and filled us in with the current events. The only thing I didn't enjoy too much was the humans coming back again, I mean it made it enjoyable but it felt like a weird repeat and the end... Miles Quaritch, LIVES?? God it made me have this hate to spider.."
"The Way of the Water succeeds where it's predecessor succeeded: in creating a world of wonder populated by people and animals that fit its logic. In fact, it raises the bar for all other films to follow in terms of its world creation. It is truly stunning, and well worth seeing on the biggest screen you can find.Sadly, it fails to upgrade its predecessor's war story, and the loss is even greater this time. The Na'vi deserve better than spending their story defending themselves from violence and irrationality. Yes, those things are real on earth, and this movie could be a parable of the expansion of European culture across the globe at the tip of a spear, but why does spiritual advancement and love have to constantly respond to evil?I, for one, am tired of it."
"I wish I could love the movie, or at least appreciate it, but sadly it didn't work for me. I know there is a lot of talent poured into this and there is nothig inherently wrong with it. It is just too much of a banality. The form is there, but there is just no soul. Yeah, the story tells us that treating nature badly is bad, and whaling is bad and humans are kind of garbage, but we do know all of that and I feel like there is more nuance in this kind of messaging in Sesame Street, where Elmo sings it, than here.Also what was mindblowing in 2009 is not as impressive in 2023. I saw it in IMAX in 3D, and this was my first 3D movie in maybe 9 years and I just wish this technology was gone for good. It did not bring anything to the table, it was just more tiring to watch this 3 hour long movie with the glasses on and having to refocus constantly. Also the visual effects - yes, everything looks absolutely gorgeous and life-like, but in 2023, we just know this is possible if enough talent, money, people, overtime and rendering time is applied. It doesn't feel magical and groundbreaking, it just looks like when you get a sequel for your ps4 game on a ps5 console - it looks much better but it isn't like jumping from Mario to Gof of War anymore.What this movie is is a roller coaster ride. Something, that would make sense as a 25 minute virtual reality ride in Disney World.I applaud all the artist for creating beutiful creatures and scenery. On one hand I loved the maori/polynesian vibes of sea clans, but at the same time I had to ask if they couldn't have done something more, than to copy the culture including face tattoos and all of that.There is plenty of inconsistencies in the story, but let's look past that. I really didn't like this overused trope of Jakesully bing hardass father who doesn't understand their kids, hardly respect his wife and wants order. Aren't there better more insteresting family dynamics? It feels like in the end Jakesully didn't really evelove based on events of the previous movie and instead just hoppen on this ""hardass dad from the 70s"" trope. N. Neytiri is so underutilized, it pains me. For most of the movie this strong female character is just kinda there diminished and her wishes are not heard even though she has strong points, but I guess she also buys in to the same trope... I wish there was more of her and we saw something new and interesting.I will just mention the humans in the movie, who are all absolutely one dimensional pure villains without a shred of redeeming quality - this time they have been reduced to be entire speices of superevil moustache twirling villains. No ""good"" humans like in the first movie (excl. Those from the original movie).So overall - this movie is for sure visualy gorgeous, technically nearly perfect, but it says so little, it is hard to think on how much money was spent on it and how much better this money could have been spent on different movies.It is like if someone wanted to paint a picture on the Moon so it would be visible from the Earth. It took several decades to develop the technology, trillions were spent to get equipment and people there - and that on its own was an achievement, but then the picture, that was painted on the moon was a simple smiley face, or something like that..."
"I went into this film prepared to be disappointed. I found myself actually entertained for the most part. However, Way of the Water is far from perfect and it's pitfalls are it's length and some poor writing.It's a three-hour film that really could have easily been reduced to 2 hours and still kept the plot coherent. Without getting ahead of myself, the plot needs a bit of exposition.Sully the main hero from the first film now finds himself a father of a brood of five children. Three of them are his own with Neytiri who are human-Navi hybrids identifiable by them possessing human shaped hands with five digits whereas the Navi have four. The fourth is an adopted hybrid who was born from the comatose Navi avatar body of the deceased doctor Grace from the first movie, the father a mystery and the fifth is Spike, a human adoptee whose father is actually the villainous Quaritch.Speaking of Quaritch, the humans have resurrected him with previously unmentioned cloning technology, this time in the form of Navi hybrid, along with a squad of other dead soldiers brought back as hybrids. While this plot point is a bit hard to take in, it serves as an important game changer for the human faction since these hybrids don't trigger an immune response from the planet's fauna and freely wonder around untouched.With Quaritch now at the head of a second human invasion of Pandora, Sully is compelled to flee from the forests to the sea tribe Navi for refuge. Here is where another weakness of the movie kicks in. It's obvious that they wanted to move the film away from the forest so they could show off all the beautiful sea and it's creatures.So they have Sully, a trained marine in his former human life, make like a coward and flee from the forests where he had previously been waging an effective guerilla war for a year against the second human invasion. Sully's decision here makes no sense as we get a bit of exposition from a human general that Sully's attacks on their activities has been devastating.One skirmish with the Navi hybrid Quaritch is all it takes for Sully to split with his family, effectively abandoning his adopted forest tribe to the mercy of the human invasion, you know the tribe that took him in and made their leader?Act 2 is where the film's pace hit a speed bump. Much of act 2 is spent focused on Sully's hybrid children as they face bullying and ostracization due to being outsiders, mixed race and also unadapted to sea life. Sully's character is largely reduced to disciplining his children especially his 2nd son whom is treated as a constant source of trouble. Neytiri too suffers a similar fate as she is reduced to a largely background character in the second act.At the same time Quaritch's hunt for Sully starts becoming all Vietnam-like as he burns sea tribe villages to try and flush Sully out. All of this predictably builds up to the meat of the movie, the set piece battle that James Cameron so loves and cares for and this where James's work once again shines true.This is a good film that could have been great if not for the 2nd act that any good writer could easily shaved down whilst still keeping the plot coherent. If there's any other positives i can say, it's main message of the importance of family and a father's struggle to do anything to protect them, even as it costs him, a positive male role model that is frankly missing in today's woke films."
"It was so Moby Dick Herman could have sued for plagiarism. The forest warriors were so more effective than the aquatic warriors in water. They taught the children to survive underwater but not the parents even though the son in particular was such a disappointment.They found life so sacred even though they tried to murder the younger son by taking him outside the reef but the poor bugger that nearly died got the blame.They took a ten year old into battle and notice that the aquatic people didn't which caused the death of the son and nearly undid it allGood movie, predictable but not worthy of its rating."
"Awful. The movie spends a lot of time getting you to care about all these made up creatures. Then purposely starts killing them in horrific ways. I walked out. Another person walked out too. I go to the movies to escape, not to be set up to care about creatures then shown their violent deaths. It doesn't accomplish what Cameron thinks. Showing the destruction to native people and animals doesn't help people to think deeply, it encourages people to dissociate and suppress how they should feel. People just say, ""oh it's just a movie, we shouldn't care so much"". It's just emotionally cruel. My daughter was sobbing! Horrible, absolutely horrible!"
"Physics in never right in this movie. Imaginary technology contradicts physics at most spaces, not in the funny way at all. For example they shot bullets never making an impact anywhere, soldiers capable to travel between planets are not trained to basic military tactics and do ad-hoc decisions, accompanied with very nonprofessional dubbing. Characters are often act dumb. I thought to write a list of all mistakes but it is completely pointless - no space for that.The worst part is how slow the story goes, how long it is and how boring it is. Young guys who this is addressed to (under 12) get maybe more bored during this looooooooong movie that they go nuts in the entire, otherwise fully packed movie.So boooooring. So looooooong and boooooooring.Honestly, I do not recommend watching it."
"I was not as impressed unlike the rest of movie society. I found visuals In the original avatar much more Captivating. Previously the CGI was gaining moment and this was on the forefront. Now with most blockbusters on this sort of trend I was let down. The 3D experience was 2/10 I feel like the potential it is huge l, but never met.This seemed very much run of the mill sequel that mimics the first movie, but without the excitement of a whole new concept. All and all a decent 3 hours I did fall asleep to, I will stick to my rating of 2.5 (of 5) stars. Congratulations James, you sunk another ship!"
"This is a great film, I think everyone can agree the visuals and cgi are incredible, most complaints I've seen lie with the ""basic"" story. The story is actually perfect, it's simple so it can resonate with every demographic, it's clear that people who hate the film simply for it's success use this ""basic story"" criticism because they have nothing else to critique.The story of both avatar movies is no more basic than the avengers, the lion king, star wars etc (almost all major blockbuster films), this is something you simply can't argue with. The thing about most of these great films is the worldbuilding, and Avatar does it perfectly.The way of water is an objectively 10/10 movie."
"James Cameron's visual marvel made me one of them, the Na'vi people. The film itself is a form of Eywa, our mind was the manifestation of the neuron dendrites that embodies every Na'vi people's hair and through it I could feel the Pandora.The connection was so strong and it made me realise that I, so also you, are both the Sky People and Na'vi People at the same time in real. The war between the two people, as shown in the movie, is the hypocrisy that we have been farming in our mind since long time ago. We are destroying our own Pandora, the Earth, like the Sky People with our day to day activities, while at the same time we know it is wrong and have been trying to save it, the Na'vi way.It is the sky people that is winning the war at the moment. It is really necessary that we bring back our Na'vi mindset to a much needed rejuvenation. Or there will be no Pandora left for us. It is your choice now.There were some plot holes in the movie. But nobody or nothing is perfect. I am writing this review to appreciate the visual marvel James has created and the message it is trying to convey to the people on our Pandora, the Earth."
"I want to preface this by saying that the original film was nothing special to me. It was your average sci-fi blockbuster that lacked a real heart. This sequel is an amazing improvement and the characters and world feel so real, relatable, and loveable.The visuals were absolutely gorgeous. At times you have to remind yourself that you are not physically in Pandora. Personally I agree that 3D is an annoying trend, but this movie was made specifically for it. It quite literally feels as you are walking among the characters, and that adds an intense depth of empathy for the characters.I'm amazed at the complaints toward the plot. Yes, it is rather simple, but its not easily predictable. The characters are realistic and easy to care about- they almost become like family to the viewer over the course of the film. I'm sure parents will resonate with this movie. The action, although perfectly executed, was actually my least favorite part as I much enjoyed the insights of each character and their struggles. Not every story needs a confusing and overly complex plot for the sake of it. This film is a perfect example.The score was corny/repetitive of the old movie at times but beautiful and original for most of the film. It truly captures the emotions at each point.The runtime was fine too- I was repeatedly wishing for it not to end. This movie is so beautiful in every way, and I can't begin to describe how it makes you feel. It can only be experienced in the theater."
"I honestly wasn't able to enjoy the movie. It just ran on wayyy too long and the runtime could've easily been trimmed down. The plot wasn't anything special and pretty predictable the whole way through. In fact, the movie pretty much uses a lot of the same situations and antagonists as the first one. The visuals was neat but I wouldn't say it was enough to carry the enjoyment through a middle half that's such a slog and really hard to get through without getting disinterested and/or falling asleep. It was like I was watching a miniseries that had to be compressed down into a 3 hour film. The way of water was a decent movie in the beginning and the last act but nothing really more than that and can sometimes feel like a complete chore to get through."
"It's amazing how easy they have killed the potential of the first avatar movie in this release. Avatar 2022 is like a Rambo and predator, too many shots, fire and violalnce with FX taken from avatar. Even the level of Fx can't compensate for the storyI can't quite understand what they're fighting for. What is the goal of the main torturer. An excess of violence created for the sake of squeezing tearsHalfway through the movie I wanted to leave the cinema. Tragic movie story, no consistency in the post-action. Mysticism was scalped. Classic shooter tearjerker.Don't go to the cinema for it.It is the end of saga for me."
"I will jump right into it. After the first 30 minutes of the movie, I was disappointed.The story wasn't great and everything felt already seen. However, after they moved to the island everything changed.Since that point, it becomes more and more an immersive mind-blowing experience.I realized this movie was never about a great action story. It is about an experience of a whole other world with an unbelievable and yet entirely meaningful ecosystem.Almost like a documentary of another planet that is perfect in every sense.How they recorded everything underwater is truly hard to grasp and for the first time in my life, I felt part of that world that exists separate from ours.You could argue first part had a better story but in reality, it is just because you are experiencing these ideas for the first time.This is the first time since the last Avatar I felt a fully meaningful use of CGI. In recent years with a stream of worthless Marvel movies, I started to blame CGI for it.But now I realize it is bad production with unimaginative creators.This movie MUST BE watched in 3D. It amplifies experience 10-fold. It makes you feel completely immersed, almost like you are inside of a VR world.Pandora is the only VR world I would love to experience and probably would be hard to let go of.I think James Cameron is already aware that VR experience of Pandora would be beyond imagination but technology is not there yet to give you the perfect experience he wants to deliver."
"I was expecting something else. I pretty much liked the first movie Avatar 1 because it had a head and a foot. A story, timeline, move pulled you in, you cared for the characters and the story.But in Avatar 2 you never know where the story goes it has no timeline nor structure, it is a constant flow from action into another with no end. This way the movie can go literally forever.Irrational decisions in the movie and exaggerated scenes, overdone projections of doom and not enjoyable. 3h of randomness. People get bored of all that very soon.Come if you like observing something beautiful and perfect being destroyed in a detailed exaggerated, almost perv way.But, credit goes to visuals. Story is poor for that director. 4years of writing a story which is 1:1 with Avatar 1 is failure.Budget for such performance is just over the limit in my opinion.In todays world spending so much money on such poor performance is not right.Soundtrack stayed the same with Avatar 1, story is the same with Avatar 1 and many things have been reused from Avatar 1. How did it cost so much then?"
The visuals of this movie are incredible. The story not so much.I gotta say this movie is worth seeing in the theaters in 3d because of the visual experience. The CGI is so good you can't tell what's computer generated and what's not. Watched this movie in AMC prime 3d and was floored by not only the cgi but the way it was shot to really immerse you into the 3d. I found myself trying to move out the way of water or swat at bugs that were flying on the screen.The story and characters are mediocre to be sure but the quality of the effects absolutely make up for it. Highly recommend people go see this in the best theatre you can find.
"I was worried about getting bored because of it being over 3 hours long, but I found myself attached for the whole movie. I thought The high frame rate was utilized well in the fast moving scenes, only a few scenes felt a little weird but I got used to it. The visuals are just so good it's meant to be seen in the theaters. I thought the simple plot and story worked well focusing more on the children then the adults. There was some corny dialogue but it's also meant to be seen by a wide audience. I will say in my opinion I think the first one was better but from a technical achievement standpoint the way of water is visually better looking."
"This sequel is a really awesome movie. Technically it is so far ahead of other blockbuster movies it really is awesome to watch. And the 3D really is an experience. This is a movie you have to go watch on a big screen and if possible in 3D.Regarding the story I was awaiting a bigger and more into your face blockbuster story. But Cameron did give us a very small scale story here focusing on Jacks family instead. So the fight in the end is much smaller in scale compared to even the first movie. I was not expecting that. But what he shows is really well made and incredible to look at but finally feels like a mixture of his other films, like ALIENS, TERMINATOR and even TITANIC. Not a bad thing and with AVATAR 3 coming up maybe a good decision to not show us the BIG fight already. Instead we get a good story of Jacks new family, learn about the new kid characters and can dive into this new world to catch fire and burn for more too come."
"9/10 AdrianosGreat movie. Saw it with nah wife and we both really enjoyed it. I still have to write 520 characters until I can submit this review so I am just just aimlessly typing nothing. Still need 400 characters which I find a lot since a movie review can be just a few sentences. I guess it weeds out the slubs that don't have much to say. Not me though, I have out smarted the system!207 characters left and honestly have nothing else to write. Please stop reading this as it is a complete waste of your time.Good see the movie. I really enjoyed it and look forward to Avatar 3+.A+ movie."
I will never forget just looking at the world of pandora. It was just so pretty and I felt like I was in another world. So for that reason alone I love this movie. To be honest though I didn't really like the story. I thought the final battle dragged for way to long. Plus I thought there were a few plot holes. And again like the first movie was rather predictable. Plus I thought some characters were under developed. Other than that I really enjoyed this whole movie. For example the water in this movie has some of the most beautiful shots I have every seen in my life. You know what It is just beautiful in general . Sure it may not have the best story or characters but it's beautiful and that's all I really wanted.
"Watched it in 3D and it didn't even feel like a movie, more like an amazing dream I'll look back on.Loved the Sully family, loved the whales, the climax was fantastic, and those visuals put pretty much every other potential Best Visual Effects contender to shame. I was in real, sheer awe for so much of the runtime of this movie. And even though it's longer than 99% of movies, the pacing was done better in this than in all the other long movies I watched this year.A truly moving experience, better than the first, and my new favorite movie of 2022. James Cameron deserves a very long vacation."
"Visually stunning with a terrific plot! Other have said the plot fell short, but I think it definitely sets up plots for the sequels. Even though it was 3+ hours, the time went by so quick as there was always something going on, it did not leave me bored. It was a perfect movie that had my heart racing at times, crying at others, and falling in love with the sea life and people of Pandora.It's amazing to see how far CGI and MoCap have come to create a movie that so seamlessly blends both together to create the world of Avatar. After watching, this is definitely one of my top favorite movies. I cannot wait for the sequels!"
"I was excited to see what Cameron would bring to the table with Avatar 2. The first Avatar raised the bar significantly, and no other film has managed to match it since. ""Avatar 2 The Way of Water"" was a visually stunning and extraordinary experience that once again set new standards for CGI.Coming to the story it was simple yet engaging, and it kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film. The characters' emotions were portrayed in a very convincing manner, and I found myself fully invested in their journey and struggles.A LITTLE SPOILER AHEAD
..One aspect of the film that I found particularly hard to digest was the concept of memory templates and the creation of Na'vi replicas of dead people out of memory. Though this was a crucial component to the story, but I believe they could have handled it better; it was clearly shown that they thought of this idea much later.. It was a bit difficult for me to digest. However, this was only a small part of the film and did not take away from the overall enjoyment of the film.Finally, DON'T MISS OUT ON SEEING THIS MASTERPIECE IN THEATERS."
"Avatar : The way of water has released in world wide in this christmas vacation. Its seems a great entertainment feast to ordians and fans of director James Cameron. It is the 9th movie which is directed by ""King of the world"" (In film field) James Cameron. Before talking about the movie I wanted to add few points about him. In his career, he always look into perfectionist in terms of making. He won't comprise with existing technology as I think. When he was making Terminator 1, at that time there was no advance technology to create liquid metal terminator so he had implemented in terminator 2. Before Terminator 2, He made The Abyss with liquid hand, liquid living things and under water shooting. Since the success of creativity of technology in The Abyss movie, he achieved the liquid terminator in Judgment day. To release the ""Avatar"" in theaters, he waited to convert 3D technology in screens. He was done numerous solo sea diving after Titanic and created documenteries.He has spent 13 years to release the movie after Avatar because of various reasons. What ever it may be, he has done a great job and crafted a good movie.In 3D, it is feast of under water scenes, magnificent creatures, lightings, blended by spiritual, cultural and emotional contents very carefully. Technological advancements also not neglected. We will come across even many tiny matters which are very heart worming experiences while watching the movie, for example When space ship landed on Pandora, forest has affected by fire and heat, and animals were try to escape from fireing land; Cutting the vegetables by Neytiri; expression and Revenge of Payakan; large Kitchen utensils in the ship in Neytiri battle;
In many under water scenes we feel really we are diving with Na'vi. In advance Technological features like building the city by robots; semi robotic soldiers ""Transraprid train;James Cameron will may love machines and sunken ship... Even sunken ship consists of many features. He can only create these kind of marvelous scenes.Once we see this movie, it's really increase the love with animals and importance of living things in planet. He has very much inspired by Sanskrit words and Hindu culture I think, we are hearing western folks are giving very values for our Hindu principals I think....."
"If you make me sit in front of this movie for a week and let me explore Pandora, I would definitely do It. What and incredible actor Sam worthington and hats off to evergreen minded James Cameron. This movie was and will be an example of how a movie which depends on VFX and CGI should be. This movie also has a step up visuals from its predecessor especially the movements of the character and the scenery. Even though the story is quite simple and not so extended from the first one but the CGI makes it unique. I am excited for the next sequel and I hope it would be as much exciting as this movie and the first one."
"I wasn't sure I'd like this film, mainly because of the run time. However, the story was involving, and the visuals kept me interested. The addition of younger characters worked well, and the reprisal of an old villain was nicely realized. Where it really excels is the visuals. The sheer scale of things was often astonishing. The quality of the image, sensational. I saw 3D, but not the HFR version. Cameron is one of the greatest directors of all time and he doesn't disappoint here. The same guy that made the Alien Queen look real, is now on a different level to everyone else completely. Not just a master film-maker but a pioneering scientist who pushes the medium to extraordinary lengths."
"Review of ""Avatar 2""
The film was scripted really well for me, by James Cameron
The plot was really intresting, the action and special effects made that
ilm even better. Music from this film was probably my favourite thing
about it, it was balanced beautifully and made by one of my favourite
music artist called ""The Weeknd"". Music conveys a lot of feelings and is
setting the mood. As I said, special effects were really realistics, the
Pandora world was really beautifull. Main actors like Sam Worthington
who played Jake Sully or Zoe Saldana who played Neytiri were still there
playing really unbelievably good, they are really great at expressing
emotions so we can experience this movie in the best way possible.Overall, I recomend this film to everyone, especially to people who
like fantasy movies. For me it was really gorgeous film to watch."
"Whoa for 13 years awaiting from avatar 1 ,,definetely avatar 2 is more awesome movies than avatar 1 ,,the visual graphic ,,the music ,,the actor and actress ,,the plot ,,the remarkable rendering view and the way of all that blend into one best ever movie that i had seen this far ,,congrats to james cameron that made avatar 2 so realistic view ,,,i've been waiting this movie since a week avatar 1 released ,,i heard there is 5 avatar sekuel ,,whoa what a great planning for the avatar sekuel ,,there fore i want to see of avatar 5 end ,,how is ending ,,it must be a great movie sekuel ever than other sekuel movie ,,thank james cameron who bring miracle to this movie."
"The 13 years of waiting for a sequel to the box office success ""Avatar"" for sure wasn't worth it.I certainly wouldn't recommend The new ""Avatar: The Way of Water"", unless you like wasting both
your time and money. The movie lacked plot, and was really disappointing overall. I was trying my
best not to fall asleep while sitting in the cinema for 3 hours straight. In my opinion, they should've
made the movie at least an hour shorter and it wouldn't be that boring. The plot overall was really
confusing to me, and I was trying my best to understand whats the point of the movie, but
I couldn't, plus the font of the subtitles was horrible (James Cameron had 13 years to change the font and chose not to). The music in the movie didn't catch my attention at all, but as far as I can remember it was pretty decent. The special effects in the movie were the best part of it. I must admit, the visuals in the movie were stunning, but compared to the prequel, they didn't change at all. The first part of
""Avatar"" was a box office success because of its visual effects, and I think considering the year the
movie was released in, it was way ahead of its time, and that's why so many people were impressed
with it and went to the Cinema to check the 2nd part out. In my opinion, the new ""Avatar: The Way
of Water"", was overall pretty bad. On a scale from zero to five, I give this movie a 2 because of the
things i mentioned before."
"An embody manner to show a breathtaking sensations, the best as in perfection differences between reality and fantasy. Fragment amount of describing perpetual attentiveness and signify standpoint, judging by frame of mind. Conducting resemblance on the most exciting inner self wish to be true enthusiasm. It is Perceptible, visually expended so much completeness of attention-getting by prevailing the mad ingenuity. I'm not surprised, can be found the intimacy best of the best of all time. The work art every view point give wholly immediate. And says perfect ""beyond compare"" Avatar : The way of water."
"I love the film ,,Avatar2"". I think that James Cameron
has a large imagination and because of that he wrote
briliant and very captivating multi-layered script. The
music perfectly fitted to this film. Scary music to scary
moments etc. Special effect shocked me so much. I was
watching it in 3D version and I really recomend it. I was
feeling that it was i n real life not at the screen. I think
the names of caracters was match ideally. Bad caracters
had the ugly one and funny caracters had the rediculous
one (for example spider). In conclusion i think that
,,Avatar2"" is fascinating and who likes science-fiction
and action movies should watch it."
"This film was great! Re-watched the first one in 3D (as it was meant to be seen) then this sequel. So many unexpected things happened (if you can manage to dodge Internet spoilers), and the story was well done. They take time with storytelling, not the lack of it you see in Marvel movies of today etc.James Cameron's films are always great. Storytelling is very well done despite what other reviewers say (most of them couldn't write a decent sci-fi to save their lives). This one is based on water, the other films will be very different. Can't wait to see.James Cameron has a great interest in oceans and marine life, films telling stories that include marine life in depth is very rare indeed. Planets in our universe or even earth with most of the surface full of water (one of the most abundant substances in the Universe) feels even more rare. When you think about it alien life would naturally most likely occur within water of some kind. Why not tell a story about it.Of all his films The Abyss (1989) was very criticized as others have done with this film. However even today (2023) if you go back and watch The Abyss Directors Cut with James Cameron's original ending its a very good film! It has held up extremely well. Interestingly it has the exact same IMDB rating as this film as of today.Critics are harsh...The Goonies is a great film. Years ago I looked and IMDB had it at 6.1 our of 10. Today its risen to 7.7 out of 10? Hmmm guess some films are like wine, maybe people finally realize their worth after some age. ;)"
"Fantastic movie. Very well made expansion of the world of Pandora.Beautiful visuals, great new and returning characters.Great concept of spirituality and environment preservation.Action scenes are excting and you can feel the tension and heat of war. Great movie with creative designs, did not see any negatives.It was as amazing as the first one.Its true that storywise it does not change much from the first one and keeps it the same, but for the same reason if you loved the first one you will love this one
Excited to see the expansion of this great fantasy world and can't wait for even more."
"Very pretty movie that is simply mindblowing. Act one establishes what has been going on for the last 15 years. Act 2 is similar to the first movie, however it is here we truly see the beauty of the new biome and why the movie took 13 years to come. The final act is Cameron at his best, a roller coaster to remember of action scenes, emotional scenes and obviously the end which reveals something that I imagine Avatar 3 is going to build upon.This movie is great, and I disagree with the criticism of it being forgettable. I will never forget this experience of watching this film, although it is far from perfect, cheesy dialogue at times, some of the plot felt cheap and could it have been shorter?"
"These films, Avatar and the sequel are extraordinary to view. Well worth the price of admission . As was the case with the original the story and some of the dialogue is cringe making but we all knew that before going in. We also get the required explosions and gun play. What a movie it could have been with those elements removed!Focussed in large part on the family of ex-earther Sully this plays like an episode of Ozzy and Harriet, right out of the 50s including the line of ""We Sully's stick together"". Ugghh. But forget about that. Just sit back and watch and get lost in the visual experience.The best acting comes from Stephen Lang. Despite the cliches that plague his evil bad guy character he still manages to give a performance that really has something to it.Perhaps the silliest thing is the necklaces glued to the chests of all the female characters. Those things never move so we are spared the horrific sight of an alien nipple which apparently would do bad things to us. But of course the dismembered arm and other violence is perfectly acceptable. I guess the censors also live in the 50s.Even so - as I said - go see it. Just don't listen to it."
"Avatar The Way of Water not only is a worthy sequel, thirteen years in the making, but is a sequel that levels up many aspects from the first movie. Beginning with the obvious, the Visual effects of the movie raise the bar to a place only James Cameron can surpass. From an advanced motion capture technology, to the overall advances in the VFX industry, The NA'vi were brought to life and with the help of IMAX and 3D, not only you will watch a movie, you will experience it. Avatar 2 also exceeds the first movie in the spectrums of world building and storytelling. Cameron and his team managed to create a compelling story, with great new characters and a really good villain. A trip to the movie theatre is a must. Make sure to see it in a premium 3d format (IMAX, DOLBY)."
"Just saw it today with my Parents in IMAX 3D.MET ALL MY EXPECTATIONS!This is my first 3D experience and braced myself for not-so perfect 3D. At first it's jittery and fuzzy. The motion of close up shots seems like have double frames? But after 20-30 mins my eyes get used to it. And from that point, bam! The stunning visuals, super realistic water, fish, I can't describe it all here because it's so beautifully done! The Pandoran night sky also was my favorite part.This is also more emotional than the first Avatar. From the Whaling scene, to the death of one of Sully's kid and his burial, and the scene where Neytiri and Jake accessed their memory with him in the tree of souls, the way Jake cried hit me hard. I was tearing up but I don't want my parents see my cry, so I held it up. I can't get over it still this time when I'm writing this review.Also, the beginning of the film, the return of RDA was so stunning! The technology the RDA have is just awesome to look at. The one scene where Pandora forest was burned with all the animals was sad but at the same time stunning.I didn't also had high expectations on Spider because others said he's so bland. But after watching it, I don't really know what part they see him bland? Maybe because he has little screen time?I enjoyed the Sully kids and their relationship with Kiri and Spider.The only negative thing I say is, I want 1 more hour of the final battle!OVERALL: EXCELLENT FILM!Haters can shut up."
"It took 13 years for James Cameron to deliver the sequel to Avatar. To say it was worth the wait may be hyperbolic, but i must concede the film sporadically immersed me into moments of wondrous splendour, the kind of which only the magic of cinema can provide.Frankly, The Way of Water made me feel the same way i did in 2009 when its predecessor took the cinema by storm; amazed by the way a picture could look but slightly dismayed by its reluctance to advance its plot before stopping to smell the roses. The waves of the splendid seas of Pandora effortlessly flowed across the screen, the same of which i can not say about the films pacing which unfortunately ebbed in the second act. The runtime is long, and it feels it. I admire Cameron's concerted effort to take his time to build Pandora; especially as its set to be home to three more sequels in the coming years, but feel that trimming the film to below three hours would have been a welcome adjustment.Nevertheless, i wont readily forget my awe when were first plunged into the majestic seas of the Metkayina, or the excitement of Neytiri confronting the ""sky people"" after the tragic loss of her son amidst the dreary drizzle of an escalating war. I was genuinely invested in Jake's struggle between leading the Na'vi and raising his young family. Particularly interesting to me are the future developments in the stories of Spider and Kimmy who i feel have the most mystery behind them. Spiders conflict between helping the Na'vi who have raised him and connecting with his absent father is a plot point which i can see headlining future instalments in the saga.Ultimately, the film is a technical masterpiece which again underlines Cameron's pursuit of performance perfection. It suffers a similar issue to its predecessor in its pacing but i am pleasantly surprised in the depth of its themes and storytelling.Roll on 2024 and the third instalment in this spellbinding series."
"Actually you need to give the Film two different ratings. One rating for the visually effects and the cinema experience and one rating for the story. The film is visually without a doubt a 10. Absolutely stunning visual effects. The 3 D looks perfect. I loved to explore the nature of Pandora, especially the underwater world this time. Every scene with the whales is absolutely perfect. I loved them so much. The story is way better than in the first part. I would rate it with a 8.In combination it is defently a must see film. A mindblowing cinema experience. I will watch it at least 2 more Times."
"This film did everything that I wanted to do: Cameron gave us greater world expansion, some better writing, and the best visual effects that I have ever seen.Don't get weighed down an illogical plot here. This is James Cameron making a hollywood blockbuster and no one does it better. The sheer spectacle of this film alone (especially in IMAX 3D) earns the price of admission.The writing is still corny at times (like all Cameron flicks) but don't let that stop you from enjoying how much heart is in Avatar 2. The drama and emotional connections to the characters in this film are much deeper than the first.Take a step into the dreamlike oceanic world that Cameron has created with an open mind because it's a beautiful sight and an incredibly exciting ride.All Cameron fans will catch a lot of self referential moments as well. This is going to smash in the box office. Those 3 hours flew by and I'll be back to see it in a month once I've had some time to digest. It's only a 9 because it's not winning best original screenplay, but Cameron probably deserves a couple Oscars for this one."
"At one point I looked behind.me in the huge IMAX theater and just saw hundreds of people all wearing our silly little glass and absolutely VIBING with Jim Cameron's amazing creation and I could have cried tears of joy.There is not much I can say that others have not covered about just how incredibly impressive this movie is, and the true joy and spectacle of watching it opening day in a huge theater. I will absolutely be paying to see this in 3D again in a month as I know a viewing on streaming simply won't be in the same league.Obviously the visual spectacle is the biggest draw, but the story is actually better than I expected and the environmental themes really resonated once again. Don't bet against Cameron."
"Title says it, an absolutely incredible CGI film, hands down, no question the camera panning/angles made the water scenes truly spectacular - a must see in 3D. So why the mediocre rating? As a movie, not much of a story at all, very predictable and everyone knows what's coming next. The attempt at a plot twist with Spider and his dad was seen coming a mile away. The obvious references to Mad Max (monkey boy), Ahab and the White Whale and Titanic (even parts of the soundtrack)... kinda stomped out any creative progress. Then things like, ok, everyone can hold their breath and distance swim... so why head back into the sinking ship instead of just swimming under the fire in the water? Oh yeah, so the mystical child who is obviously a child of Eywa, could amaze us all with her powers. I really like Avatar 1, nor so much for Avatar 2. Yes, glad I saw this on the big screen for all the dazzling eye candy, would not pay to see it again and not even interested in streaming it when it becomes available. One and done."
"I went out of my way to find a venue screening the film in IMAX 3D HIGH FRAME RATE because that is how I viewed the original in which the visual quality was like nothing I had ever seen. I have 30 years of work experience with WDI, working with 3D video projection among other things. For some inexplicable reason, Cameron chose to economize, only presenting action scenes in HFR, and the venue clearly did not have the skills to properly set up their 3D projection equipment. The image quality was terrible!!! The quality of these shortcomings plus the $20 ticket price left me very frustrated. If Cameron cannot do better than this, I will not bother with the sequels. Frankly, I really wish he would get over his blue-tailed-monkey thing and dive into something new and more creative. I worked on The Abyss and know he can do better."
"Have to say for visual this movie still worth watching. I saw the previous so many times in theatre both for visual and story however I don't think I would care to go watch this 13 year waited sequel again. No real character development, more of teen drama for almost an hour in between that you forget the real danger and real threat in the story. A new resource built for exploitation for humans to enter into new world. Main characters from before have no real impact in the story except towards the end used for action. Unnecessary filler character called Sypder with no real loyalty or value in the movie. Despicable setup of villan for next movie as well. Unresolved mysterious ""daughter"" to be setup for sequel. Cliques galore. Easy capture and recapture by villain. Dumb traps. Just sad apart from visuals."
"First and foremost, this is another spectacular masterpiece in term of visual effects made by the best. However, the whole story is just pointless.In Avatar 1, humans (Sky People) were invading the planet for their survival. At least they tried diplomacy before they had to resort to violence. They were fighting a sufficiently justified war, while Jake (protagonist) betrayed them - his old species.So in Avatar 2, the opposite happened. Humans came back to the planet to exact revenge, not on the aliens, but singularly on Jake - a childish and irrational cause. This time the humans were fighting an unjust war, and Jake was justified to fight back, so that viewers could stop hating him, stop discussing whether he should be hated or not. However, the movie ended up pointless."
"After long wait of 13 years, Avatar: The Way of Water finally face the world. Avatar is one of mine best memory of childhood. Now this new Avatar let me think a lot of things that human keep on destroy our mother earth and getting the resources from the nature. Avatar just like everyday life species around us. And we keep on destroy their habitat.I will still giving high ratings because director of this movie nailed the feelings of what will happen if human also be traded like, and the strong bonding of each family members.For the language which is Na'vi language use in water also fabulous. After doing some research, language that used is actually created by Paul Frommer.Last and foremost, still excited to wait the new Avatar. Remember to go toilet first before you go and watch the movie, otherwise it will become the way of water in toilet after the movie!"
"I was so amazed when I first saw Avatar in 2009. We may all joke that whole thing was Pocahontas, just on another scenery, but it was revolutionary in graphics and experience.What happened this time? Well, picture is still there... same beautiful, but just same. You may see something like this in modern games already, there's nothing new... well except how awesome it was in IMAX.But now, it wasn't enough to outweigh the scenario... it's just... empty?! Yes, in dramatic moments you feel the pain for character, yes you believe them... but all so predictable, that 3 hours becoming just too much.No twists, evil is evil if it's already ""evil"". But basically sending someone on purpose to die, but by ""good"" side representative... just a silly move and is not punished. Kids... you know them, nothing bad happened in the end anyway...Oh no, we must leave everyone who cares about us and ready to fight with us, as we may attract danger onto them, and also to save the family. Oh wait here we also already brought danger, and might bring all into danger again... but nah, these guys take us as their own, let's stay with them now. So why not to stay with the previous in the first place... a specially you were kind of their leader and they depended on you...This and many other flaws already can't be overwhelmed with beautiful picture, it could in 2009... as it's already 2022. Would be awesome movie, if scenario had some logic... and more work."
"Whether because it's novelty wore off after the second viewing, or because the general storyline had been done so many times, the first Avatar never really hit it home for me. With barely a passable script and some hammy acting, Avatar relied heavily on its groundbreaking visuals. Yet over a decade later, only being able to see it streaming on the small screen, it really seems to have lost all of its luster. It leaves me wondering what made this such a big deal in the first place that it broke box office records again and again?Enter Avatar 2. After waiting a few weeks for the crowds to die down, I finally got to see it. Now suddenly I'm reminded (at least I think I'm reminded) of what made the first one so impressive. Was I being to harsh on that landmark spectacle? Did I just need to see it again in IMAX 3D? While I won't be clamoring to see the original in the same format just to answer these questions, I will say that the sequel does take away that feeling of 'meh' for the franchise.Even in the same format I don't think the first Avatar looked as crisp and detailed. And somehow the rendering of the alien faces is much more developed as I found the character's expressions much more sympathetic than they were the first time around. Certainly Sam Worthington doesn't inspire as many groans as his acting did before. Dare I say I actually like his character now.At three hours long, it can certainly be said that the plot is a little overwrought, especially towards the end. And there's little to suggest that the other planned sequels will be able to take off in any meaningful way... yet despite that lack of depth, there is still an emotional core to this movie rooted in the family dynamics of its characters. At times it can tug on the heartstrings forcing you to shed a tear.All the conceptuality in this film was given to the art design and I must say I was quite surprised by how much I found interesting. Just some of the sets, creatures and technical concepts I found to be very creative. Even with the sound off, Avatar 2 could command your attention. It remains to be seen, if this will still be interesting a year from now streaming on Disney+.Whereas the first film was the pioneer, the second one treads that same path much easier and so has the benefit of looking better and feeling better. Yet as sequels go, this could easily have been the last Avatar movie and no one would be upset. There are no loose ends, there is no suspense about what will happen next in the story. Without some greater purpose, (we will have to wait for 3 and 4 brings to the table) Avatar 2 is certainly no Empire Strikes Back, but then again Avatar 1 was hardly A New Hope either."
"No one can explain this experience ..go and watch in 3d
Take your kids and family they love it.Visual treat..
Long movie but you never get bored...
Emotional .. goosebumps...damn kill them moments ..reviews or words from anyone can't explain this visual wonder.Every each individual has to go to theatre and I suggest all to watch it in 3d because you will experience the true James camaron magic.At some part of movie I became member of sully's family and wanted to take revenge ..and then the whale moment comes... Damn that's what I wanted kill them kill them show no mercy...
And it's bit emotional as well... It's funny but true 3 girls sitting beside me cried for the last scenes."
"Very beautiful movie, visually worth it just for that alone, the storyline focuses on family, acceptance, respect and fighting for freedom against profiteers, and the best one...staying calm. The characters develop as you go along and become invested and immersed in the beautiful, spiritual and familiar world of the moon Pandora as it explores the northern and southern water tribes. So many things happen in this movie, so many intricate unique personalities and plenty of love for life and different species personally connected to the characters. There is so much to say about the events and how they unfold in sadness and in triumph, as soon as you feel the relatable family unity and closeness of the Sully clan, you fall in love with these protagonists, you know you're in good hands with writer, director James Cameron. Go see this beautiful movie in 3D Imax before it goes away, it's truly fantastic."
"The visuals really do make me gasp for breath. Bravo James on that! But...there is the screenplay. Avatar 1 was Dances With Wolves meets Ferngulley. This feels like Dances With Wolves meets Free Willy. There are so many plot ideas scattered around both movies that could have been woven into a really interesting story that really SAID something!Instead this mother load of ideas is just passed on as just part of the passing scenery. The Earth is dying...BUT they can afford to send not just one starship but a whole fleet to put down those pesky arrow shooting Navi. How the devil can a depleted dying planet afford that kind of extravagance, not to mention the multi-ton armored vessels and robot exoskeleton warbots and guns. Pandora is 4.5 light years away for crying out loud! And who would bother? The original Avatar villains were a private company. Why try to settle a planet you can't even breathe on. The entire movie is peppered with plot holes like this.Reminds me of the jump from Return of the Jedi to The Force Awakens where a victorious Rebel Alliance is suddenly defeated and driven into near extinction by a new Galactic Empire without any background explanation as to how victory turns into defeat.The mysterious Eywa that interconnects all life on Pandora is barely mentioned and certainly plays no part in the plot. Too bad. There could have a great plot twist if She had.When people remember this movie that will comment on its amazing visuals but will not mention its Meh story."
"Spoilers enclosed.Never easy to try and top a film that grossed 2.9 billion, so much so that they didnt. In fact they never got close.Visually its stunning and an improvement on its 2009 predecessor as one would expect.The film plays homage to many of the players in this incarnation of the franchise, whether in person or as an avatar.There are a few holes in the plot line which is hard to fathom out why given the enormous budget provided but there it is.The film starts on Pandora and soon after the humans arrive at which point a graphic pops up saying ""one year later"" There is a huge settlement the size of a city which we are shown from a distance but no more.Thereafter we enter into the meat of the film which focuses entirely on the vendetta that lives inside the avatar of Colonel Quaritch and his relentless pursuit of Sully who killed his real life character, except he didn't it was Neytiri.It wasn't plausible for me when the base on pandora was a city of such magnitude that it would let the pursuit of Sully continue given the cost to lives and equipment of the Colonel and his cohorts.The story moves to the water tribes as sully and his family leave the forest in an effort to avoid to avoid bringing the conflict to the forest. This element of the film focuses on relationships and the way of the water tribes. Allied to the visuals this is the films richest vein in quality.We have the usual epic finale and we are left without any doubt of a further manifestation of the franchise which is a shame as they invariably dilute from the foundation stone from whence they came.Fans of Avatar will enjoy it and it is worth your 3hours plus of your time."
"To be able to enjoy the film, you have to keep your eyes wide open, your ears closed and your brain switched off as much as possible!It is absolutely incomprehensible to me how so many people can produce such a film for so much money! It must be some kind of ""everything is awesome"" mentality in this industry that not at least one person who has something to say hasn't put their finger up and said ""Uhm James, what's in the script at one point or another, maybe we shouldn't do it like that!"" Especially after a great first part, it's incomprehensible how this script made it to the big screen! What a big disappointment!"
"C'mon. I know you want to change the setting to the ocean. You want us to love whales. But you need to come up with a better excuse for this transition than this story.Jake Sully was such a great character in the first installment. From a handicapped marine, he rose to the occasion to fight against what he deemed wrong. He assembled all the clans in an organized fashion to fight the evil humans. He must know they will come back. He must devise a plan in preparation. There are even some scientists left on Pandora. You can play with how the Na'vi are against modernization. They don't want to turn into sky people themselves. You can play with how the Na'vi people think the sky people will never ever come back until they are. And then they implement the defensive plan, only to be sabotaged by these annoying Sully kids. Then the great dilemma will be to save his kids or sacrifice them for the greater good of ALL the Na'vi people. And, as sad as it is, Jake and Netiri decide to sacrifice their kids and leave them to their own device. Cue tears. But then (miraculously) the kids can save themselves with their own resourcefulness and earn the audience's respect. Now they have a place in our hearts. Happy ending. The Good triumphs again. The kids have learned and proved themselves worthy. We leave the theatre fulfilled.I have heard of the High Ground. But I haven't read it yet. Cameron already wrote a script similar to what I imagined. But he scrapped it and gave us the Way of Water instead. Jake Sully, for some unexplained reason, has chickened out. He sacrificed everybody else and what he fought for in the first film and went hiding. What was in his head? He let the humans plunder anything they wanted. He did not care about his forest clan or his new sea clan and the nearby clans which are supposed to be his extensive family or at least fellow humans, ermm, Na'vi. Did he truly believe he and his small family could live happily ever after in hiding? It took him one whole movie, 3 hours and 12 minutes at that, to have an epiphany that this couldn't work. I refuse to believe he is THIS stupid! You guys really did Jake Sully dirty.If you really, really want to include the ocean setting and the whale hunt, why couldn't you make the ocean setting be one of Sully around the globe ""cultural exchange"" tour to try to instigate the Na'vi to prepare to fight? Why couldn't you make the whale serum directly related to the war on Pandora, instead of the anti-aging stuff, and make the battle for it fiercer?This is Pandora at war. To make teenage angst the main theme is just very very very annoying. You can't shove Lo'ak down our throat and expect us to root for him. And please, please, please don't kill Jake Sully off and let Lo'ak be his replacement in the next film. I'm gonna HATE you for that."
"I don't know if the movie was meant to be so dull that the colour did not show at cineplex Scotibank theatre in Vancouver. Had to see the trailer again at home and it was 100 times better. But will wait for it to come to Disney and will watch it in vivid and will rerate it. I have to check with a few friends, if the colours off the creatures were better when they saw it or to be seen.Had to see the first part again to get that loving felling back, since I was so disappointed after I watched the way of the water. If it was the theatre then James C has to let the theatre know what are is requirements to screen it."
"I was going to give this movie a 9/10, but I gave it a 10/10 just because I just enjoyed this movie so much and not just because of the breathtaking visuals also because I really loved the story as well. I didn't saw this movie in 3D and still I felt I was in Pandora. Without giving away anything this story is so simple and yet so original, you care for all the characters old and new, you even care about the villain. James Cameron in my opinion delivered once again a great sequel just like he did with Aliens and Terminator Judgement Day completing his holy Trinity of the best sequels I've seen."
"The accumulated longing for a sequel that filled the heart of every cinema fan over the past decade was sadly demolished by a mediocre shocking movie. I honestly can't believe that we actually waited 13 years for this disappointing sequel. Although I knew for sure before watching it last night that it wouldn't dethrone the first part as the highest grossing movie of all time, or even reach its level of artistic dramatic content.Avatar: The Way of Water is without any doubts one of the most visually stunning movies you'll ever see on the big screen, with breathtaking scenes that will leave you in disbelief, but the poor narrative made me feel like I was watching some episodes from National Geographic. One thing I learned over the years is that beautiful visuals don't necessarily make a good movie, but rather it enhances the viewer's experience to get the maximum of feelings that the director wants to convey. Unlike the first part, this one has nothing to add the whole avatar story in terms of plot and dramatic emotions, it was nothing but an action film that can even be merged with the first one without even noticing. Even though the first one has a sequence of abrupt events in the first hour, but they actually served the plot that revolves around the human conflict in deciding what's right and wrong. And how can the moral code of someone plays a pivotal role in serious decisions to make.Is it all bad? Absolutely not, Avatar 2 has some great battle scenes in the water world with all its beautiful creatures, but that's it. Just a shallow beauty with no substance at all."
"After waiting so long for the sequel of a film that i gave 10/10 , sure my expectations where extremly high.The music was the same, the scenary and nature looked the same. Some of the actors where pre and post mortum the same.The film was sooo long. One bathroom break to long. In big parts of it I was expecting Sir David Attenborough to pop up from the blue with Greta by his side.Abit of spoilers alert:Three things got my confused, and not in a good Dazed and Confused way. Who is Kiras father? Why is she more intuned with Eywa? And why is all the hyperactive warheads on a personal vendetta after enemy leaves battlefield?I had to close my eyes for what felt like an hour, but maybe it was 10 minutes in reality. I couldnt stand the scene that in so many ways reminds of Japan and Norways murders on wales and dolphins.Overall i gave it 6/10. But i will never see this film ever again."
"***Spoilers Within***Was really big fan of the first Avatar.I felt like the first half of the movie was very similar to the first Avatar, except in the sea instead of forest. Learning how to ride, shoot, etc, also except his son learning it. Similar feel like how Star Wars ep9 is a bit of a mirror of ep6. I would give the first half 6.5/10The 2nd half was really good, action packed and fit together nicely. Gets a 9.5/10 for the 2nd half. It wasn't just the action that made it better, first half felt like re-hashing, wehreas the 2nd half felt it it was actually telling the story. The first half felt like it crawled whereas the 2nd half flowed very well.I was also kind of hoping there would be a different bad guy, and it doesn't really explain Spider and Kiri. The whole immaculate conception thing doesn't doesn't really jive for me, unless they explain it later, otherwise it's seems like a lazy/cheat way to put a character into the storyline without actually needing to give rhyme or reason how they got there. It might turn out later they explain that part more. Also maybe later they will give more background on Spider. I kind of felt that instead of the growing up story of the first half of the son, they could've spent some more time to explain these two pieces."
"The story of Avatar the way of water is quite similar to the first movie that is Avatar 1 which came back in 2009.The vfx has been better and it feels much realistic than the first movie.Story wise the connection which the first movie was able to make with the audience is a bit missing.Nevertheless, as it is a sequal it does a great job compared to other moves sequals.It's because sequals generally can't exceed their prequels.Well I am happy to see the old characters of the first movie back in action and also the beautiful views of the moon PandoraThis movie left a cliffhanger in the end, so let's see what happens in the third movie Avatar 3."
"This movie was a letdown. The graphics may do it for some people, but the plot was non-existent. Most of the time it felt like a direct copy of other movies:
lion king (the holding up of the baby to the sun//star and then again leaving the offspring off in a ""forbidden zone"")
Black Panther: pretty much the whole movie feels like black panther 2 continuance.Titanic: the end scenes
Terminator: just the random, wanton violence and destruction.3 hrs is too long for this movie. There should be congressional approval needed for movies longer than 3 hrs.I am reluctant to criticize James Cameron creations, but this certainly was a huge disappointment."
"In the first Avatar movie, there were outsiders creating chaos for money and the Na'vi suffering because of their greed. They wanted to protect their land, their way of life, their culture and not let it ruined by the men of greed - the sky people. Clans united fighting for their land with their leader. That story was strong, had substance and connected to all of us emotionally.In this one, however, all this chaos just for revenge? And all the other bad guys in the system played along with the master villain leaving their own agenda at the back burner? This couldn't get me connected to the story.Stunning visuals as expected from JC!!"
"Looks very pretty - if you can see it in IMAX 3D then great....But the plot is dreadful, convoluted, nonsensical and written to provide opportunity for showing off the 3D animations.The acting is appalling and wooden, the script is trite and formulaic, everyone sounds like they're doing a first read-through.Every scene is about twice as long as it needs be. Long laboured scenes whose only purpose seems to be provide opportunities for extra 3D'ness and animated over-the-top prettiness.Overall its a pretty rubbish movie.If you can see it in 3D IMAX then the prettiness is worth it... but otherwise I wouldn't bother."
"Wow, it actually happened. Over a decade since he changed the world of filmmaking forever, James Cameron finally releases the first sequel he promised us years ago.Before I even get into the film, I just have to share my amazement that it actually exists. I remember going to see the original, it was an event. I was about 10, and even though I had no clue who Jim Cameron was, I knew there was weight behind it. Afterwards, I remember my mom reading an article talking about the planned sequels, and how the first was gonna be a bit of a wait, coming out in the far off year of 2014! (To a ten year old in 2009, that was an eternity away). As the years passed, I grew to believe it was just a what if, something we could all imagine, but probably wouldn't actually see come to life. I'm so happy to say I was wrong.Let's start with the obvious, what we're all here for, and what the film really exists for, the visuals. This film, has the greatest effects I have EVER seen. Bar none. It was real, you were looking at the images a camera captured of a real world. At no moment did it feel like I was ever looking at something created on a computer. And the closer the camera got, the more scrutiny they put on the shot, the better it looked. Any close up of a face, a hand. It didn't have that sheen or gloss that some cg has, it was just real. The way the light moved across skin, water splashing up and down someone half submerged. Every single detail.The stand out of course, is the water. Every single underwater scene was astounding. The first time we got to explore the world below the surface, my jaw hit the floor. It was like planet earth on a whole other planet! Living, breathing creatures that felt completely alive. It was true movie magic.The story is simple, as with the original, but it works. Within minutes I felt right back at Pandora, with Jake and Neytiri, and their new family. It was as if no time had passed from the original. Felt like returning home.And while the story is simple, it's filled with richly drawn characters and and a deep, beautiful world. The characters have depth, goals, aspirations. Their personal stories and struggles that we can relate to. Plus, the film beautifully shows the connection between all living things on Pandora. The relationships between the Na'vi and the animals of the planet is one of the main focuses and biggest strengths of the film, and it all leads into the grand, thrilling, and emotional finale.Is it a perfect film? No, of course not. It's got some things here and there you could nitpick, and it's definitely only the start of the story, but as a first entry in this unbelievably long awaited batch of sequels, it manages to satisfy me enough to appreciate the film on it's own, while leaving me excited to see the story continue and what comes next!"
"One of the best cinematic experience in my life. Story can it be improved to somewhat though outstanding graphics and performances has overcome that aspect as well. It was a nice ride under water and can't wait to see the BR as it's gives more calirty and detail on visual images. It's a worth a wait and I simply love it and started count down for next chapter. Well done to one of the most outstanding director we ever have and kudos to entire co as well. This might be the highest grossing movie we may ever witness and would like to someone like Hugh Jackman or Jason Samoa as they are really suite to be under blue ... Sam , Zoeyy you two were..... 💙🖤💙"
"Really enjoyed it. Beautifully done, but I kept waiting for the rich and vibrant colors to appear. I thought maybe the idea was to keep it a bit darker-less color initially-then pull us into some kind of Eden. Not only did this never happen, at times I thought the color was flat. Later, when we get to the water people, I thought here's where it's going to get really beautiful. NOPE. I really don't get it. How can you take 9-10 years to do a sequel, make it a great story and wonderful CGI, yet leave out one of the most important elements? This should have been a feast for the eyes. Still, worth watching and I'm sure it will be part of our 4K collection."
"I have never given a film 10/10 before - but I honestly just came out the cinema, with tear soaked cheeks! The most visually stunning film I have ever seen, I almost felt like I was watching a nature documentary in parts. I thought the storyline was actually better than the first one, contrary to some other reviews. This one was more thought provoking and emotional, but still had the action and drama of the first one. It leaves some things to your interpretation which I liked too. What I love about this film is that all the characters have depth, which again is why I think this film is better than the first. Highly urge everyone to watch!!"
"BEWARE SPOILERS AHEAD !!!!!Soooooo............. Where to even start with this movie...........it's just...i don't even know, I can't use just one sentence to sum up this mess.So, some time has passed since the first film, Jake & Neytiri have kids now and the sky people have returned, somehow Quaritch is back (they explain it but it's not like it makes sense), he wants revenge and Jake and his family have to go into hiding -that's as basic of a version of the plot as you'll ever get. But, despite the setup, the rest of the story is relatively weak. Because the Sully family has to live now in a different tribe, the first half of the film is basically the first film all over again(and it feels weirdly forced), it's just that it's Jake's whole family doing it.Speaking of which, there's so much character related stuff that I want to talk about....... Here's just some of the character related plot holes: How and when was Spider born (clearly he was born before the end of the last film, so why didn't we know about him before) How did Grace's avatar get pregnant, how was Kiri born and who was her father (don't get me wrong, I'm glad they didn't reveal who her father was, it would have been the wrong person whoever it was) Why does Neytiri not tolerate Spider, and how does she go from mild dislike to ready to kill him over the course of the film when they spend exactly 0 time together (it makes no sense if it's because he's Quaritch's son, because Jake and Grace were working under his orders in the first film, and while she was sceptical at first, she does accept them)Wouldn't that substance they take from the tulkuns make the entire events of the first film avoidable,and, if so, why didn't they use it back then instead of bringing Jake in in the first place; Do the sky people no longer care about unobtanium and why didn't they come back sooner.Also this film is really good at starting a story-line and dropping it exactly 10 min later or just inventing one half way through and pretending like it's been there the whole time. Some examples include: Lo'ak & Tsireya's relationship (or wannabe relationship); The friendship/brotherhood thing going on between Kiri & Spider, the reason they hunt tulkuns, and why does Ronal hold a grudge against Jake.Which conveniently leads me to my next point, WHO WAS WRITING THESE CHARACTERS IN THE FIRST PLACE. At times it legit feels like they just rolled the dice and went with it. This is where Ronal comes in in my argument. If I were to ask you about two years and a half ago what you knew about this film you -----like the entire rest of the world----- would have said something about all the stuff that Kate Winslet did for this film; And what did they do with her character ??? That's right, NOTHING !! She's just there for like half the film, occasionally glancing at Jake in disapproval AND THAT'S IT !!! Also, what the hell was going on with the whole Lo'ak outcast story ?! It makes sense that they thought they needed to develop all the characters (which they don't do anyway) and making so that one of them is half the time alone means you have to focus some scenes just on him ,but also, if you wanted an outcast story, Spider was there the whole time, the story was basically writing itself. But No! ,they did that whole thing with him and Quaritch, which I would have been ok with if they would have actually done something with it.And the ending just feels like it was thought up last minute. There's absolutely no reason for Spider to save Quaritch other than the fact that James Cameron can't find another way to bring him back from the dead again. And also, if they wanted to kill someone, it should have been Lo'ak , not Neteyam, because it would have actually had some emotional weight to it. Also, all the characters feel generally underdeveloped.And, as a side-note, the film presents itself and really wants you to treat it like a legacy sequel, but the story and the film itself read much more like this film is just a normal direct sequel; so basically the film wants you to treat it like something way more ---I don't think the word is ""prestigious"" but something around there---- than it really is.Yes, I know I gave this movie a very high rating for how much I've been hating on it, but this movie is really more than just a movie, it's something you experience, and there it succeeds. The cinematography is more than just gorgeous, so are the special effects and the Oscar was practically already won the second this film got announced.So, definitely go see it, but don't expect greatness from the story."
"If you have a copy and past personality, like popular things just because they're popular, or are incapable of thinking freely then thus is the movie for you. All I'll give it is its barely better than the first, but that is misleading. I would give the original movie a 0 out of 10 and this one a 0.3 out of 10. It pains me deep inside knowing that these two movies are some of the highest grossing movies ever. The movie is completely predictable, I knew the ending maybe 10 minutes into the movie. I very very highly suggest you save your money and use it for something more worth it, for example, literally anything else."
"First of all, I think this movie is beautiful and I'm not sorry for going to the movies and buying the ticket.The world that was created is remarkable and I'm in awe with imagination of the creators, really extraordinary.But the story is in my opinion just an opposite - it is lacking imagination and it is a shame that this rich world has such a poor story and language. This use of the word ""bro"" is so annoying and unnecessary and I don't understand that at all. Overall language in the script feels poor and english is not my mother tongue.The plot just makes the characters look a little bit stupid, I'm sorry.They are nice and interesting, but their actions are making them look stupid and use of ""bro"" doesn't help either.At the last third of the movie I had a feeling, that the same plot is repeating with change of different scenery, but at least the scenery is so impressive, that you can overcome repeating plot theme without falling asleep."
"The movie was absolutely amazing. From the stunning graphics to the captivating story, it was a true masterpiece. I was blown away by the level of detail and effort that went into every single frame of the film.The story was incredibly engaging and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout. It was full of twists and turns, and I found myself constantly guessing what was going to happen next. The characters were well-developed and I found myself rooting for them from the very beginning.One of the standout elements of the movie was the incredible graphics. They were some of the best I've ever seen, and really added to the overall experience. The action scenes were particularly impressive, with every punch, kick, and explosion looking incredible.Overall, this movie is a must-see for any fan of the genre. It's a true blockbuster and easily the best movie of 2022. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and go check it out as soon as possible. You won't be disappointed."
"This is not a movie I would recommend for kids. I was very disappointed in the story. The graphics and 3D were good, but the story itself was near impossible to sit through. It shows humanity at it's worst. The whole thing from beginning to end was heartbreaking. There were little spots where it was cute, but I had a really hard time sitting through the destruction, violence and horror. No one wants to a beautiful world get destroyed by greedy humans, killing innocent children, and innocent animals. This was horrific. It was depressing the entire time. It never lets up, and in the end the main bad guy lives while innocents die."
"The film did not feel right to me in most scenes. Especially the fighting scenes were very boring and a I played around with the 3D glasses and my handy to keep time passing. Some of the music, visuals and atmosphere was quite pleasing. The apnea scenes from the end when the kids rescued their parents were better, and a wish they'd hired the screenwriter of the octonauts to create the overall film plot. Although the computer animations seem very good at the present time, looking at nature and scenes in real life is way more fascinating and realistic to me. I think I will not see the parts 3 and 4."
"I usually hate 3D. Do yourself a favor. Watch in 3D.I saw both versions. The 2D version just didn't have the technology to optimize the viewing experience. Not to mention IMAX has the necessary and correct brightness and colors.This movie is not just eye candy. It's so much more. The family dynamic makes this movie extremely relatable, and makes you care about the family of Toruk Makto.Neytiri / Zoe Saldana brings her A game yet again.Not to mention the solid action scenes.I think the overall strengths of the movie, outshines any potential shortcomings.I've seen this movie 4 times already, and it's only Tuesday Dec 20. Just to give you a clue how much I love this movie."
"""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is some bloody delicious frustration. On the one hand the film includes a delicate fusion in the messy plot, but it defends itself among others, by specific, technological approach to acting, in which you can feel the craftsmanship of some actors' experience. However, most importantly, ""The Way of Water"" is about plotting history with a visual layer that is turbo-delightful, appears to be an epochal achievement in cinematography in terms of the technologies used in the film and the immersion of such a work by the viewer. Really, my dears, it is impossible to assess ""The Way of Water"" fully objectively; Cameron knew what he was doing and how he was doing it. He knew that it would not satisfy all recipients, so he focused on combining a powerful graphic stimulus with the most advanced graphics engine and setting, accompanied by wonderful music with a typical action plot, which, however, does not lack a note of individual and community drama.Sorry for my not good understood English. :)"
When it comes to critics they have absolutely zero care for the common movie watcher. They get paid to say big words and find things wrong with movies. Me? I am a regular movie goer. I carry the opinion of most regular people that just go the cinema when there is something that really catches there eye. Just wanted to lay the ground work for where my review is coming from. This movie was truly one of a kind. It's what a like to call a teleporter flick. It will take you from your seat directly into Pandora and leave you there for Three Hours!! You can't keep checking reviews and looking for time with this movie. You need to just go and see it!
"To start off, I did not re watch the first avatar and it would have been benefitial if I did prior.The pacing seemed fast, yet slow at the same time. Let me explain. The story goes through a lot to try and build characters. However many parts were slow and dragged on. So overall, the pacing, for me, was just too all over the place.The story seemed inconclusive and messy as well. It tried to build too many characters where I couldn't really connect fully with one. And where the story could have dug deeper to build a solid synopsis, it drifted elsewhere. It tried to do too many things all at once and remained on the surface level of each storyline it pursued.The only good thing I liked where the graphics. It's an eye candy alright. I just wished the actual story was better."
"From the outset, watching it in 3D in a proper movie theater keeps one dazzled in visual terms for the slightly oversized 3 hrs+ playtime. To the rest content-wise I think most has been said in the majority of comments here - it is essentially a lentghy revenge drama before a stunning postcard background. What needs adding I feed, is the implicit and sometimes quite explicit outdated concepts and messages to the audience. Blue Navis are mocked for their looks and physical features (among humans, that is called racism ). Tribes are ruled by somehow divinely or anchestorally selected Kings, but of course it feels OK since they seem to be nature loving peaceful natives - that's why a whale who has justifiedly fought cruel humans who are slaughtering his peers, is considered an outcast by the water Navi - literally untouchable. Women are at times shown as emancipated and strong warriors but essentially their main role is caretaker of the family and looking good, while the Father must protect his family, because that's what gives meaning to his life (praphrased from the movie). The girls have their best moments in beautifully smiling into the camera or teaching how to free dive, while the boys brawl and beat each other until bruised and bloody - the dad double checks that the other side looks worse and gives an approving pat on the back to his oldest offspring, while the little trouble maker needs some strong words and punishment. Violence is a good thing apparently, as long as you win. Balanced gender roles, let alone equality - no place in Cameron's vision of the Navi society, which have our sympathies because they are on the right side of the struggle against the admittedly much worse people, the human invaders.Not sure what to do with all of this beautifully packaged messages from the past. Visuals stunning and futuristic, but the story is full of reactionary, even dangerous messages if an global audience takes it unreflectedly in and the movie does not deliver at least some messages of opposition or controversies towards this issues."
"First of all, I don't know how James Cameron has pulled this off with a movie that came out 13 years back. He blew away the first one with this and from here on out, it gets bigger and better. The water scenes will make your jaws drop. Only thing I was kind of skeptic about was the start as it was going too fast but the way it covers all it's grounds was crazy. The plot was really thin but who cares. It's a James Cameron cinematic bonanza and that's what matters. The 40 minute climax is one of the best action pieces I have seen in my life. The movie is something you wouldn't expect from the trailer as the narrative is based much differently. It's based more on jakes kids more than himself. I've heard this franchise will end in earth with the Navi going there and imagine just what Cameron will create with that plot. Take a bow Team Avatar. You are bringing a '' need hella guts'' movie and to be making this movie for so many years and putting in that dedication with the technology is something that isn't really seen anymore."
"James Cameron never disappoints, and Sigourney Weaver deserves an Oscar (finally) for this.All the naysayers are wrong and missing the point. This is a coming of age myth about cherishing life. It's not trying to be a ""plausible realistic sci-fi story"". It's a grand allegory told by the greatest living craftsman and innovator of cinema, a complete Hollywood outsider and a-hole who does whatever he wants and doesn't take marching orders from marketing idiots and let his scripts get whittled away into nothing by ""writing teams"" like all the terrible crap coming from Disney/Marvel.This is the Steve Jobs of movies making his magnum opus using all the best paints and brushes in the industry, such as Stephen Lang and Sigourney Weaver. Is it kind of dumb to have the same bad guy return again, from a story perspective? Maybe. But the thing is, there is no other actor who could have pulled it off and would have been willing to go through what these actors had to endure for this film. So lets give Cameron a pass here. Ultimately it works just fine, and if you get hung up on that, you're a curmudgeon who cannot enjoy anything and you're missing the damn point.Critics and film scholars, being part of the Hollywood snobbery establishment, have always hated Cameron, and always will. They don't want to admit that cinema has always been at least as much about engineering and technological innovation as it has ever been about ""art"". These idiots just want to get to be the people who get to say what's true art and what isn't, but the reality is they're morons, the end.This is a great film. Go see it, and clap at the end, because it deserves it."
"My 6/10 is derived from 10/10 for visuals and 2/10 for plot.Visually stunning, but it's a shame they didn't apply 1% of this creativity to the storyline. Don't worry about spoilers - you've seen all the plot twists at least 100 times. Starts off as cowboys and Indians (except the cowboys are the baddies), and morphs into the Poseidon Adventure, with a hefty dose of Father Knows Best thrown in for good measure. And loooong. The kids get captured twice! - I was worried I'd been caught in some sort of infinite movie loop. The final showdown lasts at least a quarter of the entire 180+ minutes. And of course the baddie somehow lives to see another movie."
"I've seen it in 4DX and it was an experience. So:3D effects, visuals, audio etc: 10 out of 10. It is significantly more spectacular than the first, which was incredible in its own right. You must see it in 3D, otherwise is just an absolutely waste of time and money.Story, dialogues, world-building, consistency, logic etc: a solid 1 out of 10. The message is great, but the delivery through the story is abysmal. Worst than the first, which was a performance not so easy to achieve.Morals: We're told that killing whales is extremely immoral, and I agree. But while it's not Cameron's business to do something about it, I can't really take his outrage serious since he's just making money from it. And he can do something about it by using his significant influence to put pressure on Japan, for example. This corporatist children movie gets a 4 for hypocrisy.Overall (10+1+4)/3=5."
"Should have been an hour shorter to make it much more enjoyable. James Cameron punished us for watching this with sealife overkill to make most of the movie feel like a Documentary. Most of our group felt like sleeping or switched off for a while part way through. There is only so much sea life you can watch. Apart from that, was great to watch, and brilliant if an hour of documentary was cut out. I wonder if it's trying to sell toys and merchandise now which is why they added a lot of superfluous sealife to made it poorer for viewers, just like they did when adding Jar Jar Binks to Star Ears!"
"The animation and acting- everything was great! There were some fps stutters here and there when watching the movie, but that's not the producer's fault. It's just the film being demanding for the projectors in our cinema. So for the best experience, be sure to watch Avatar 2 in the most modern cinema you know!Furthermore I really enjoyed the first and middle part of the story: Watching the Sully family learning the habits of the Metkayina was cool!There were just two things which I didn't like: Number 1 being some unlogical character decisions/situations, for instance: Why did the Metkayina suddenly disappear when fighting the earth people at the end? They were fighting for a while and helping Jake/the Sully family,-boom, they vanished and didn't show up again until the end of the movie. So Tonowari and Ronal just left behind their daughter!?And then the villain only really survived for being a part of the third movie. That's incalculable. On the other hand, of course I can understand why Spider saved him-, but still...Number 2 is the last fight, which was a bit too long according to my opinion. I know it's a 3 hour movie, but I think the last part could've been some minutes shorter.All in one I'm giving the second Avatar movie something between 7 and 8. Besides my critical points, the animation and the realistic look of this picture is definitely worth a watch on the big screen and you shouldn't miss the opportunity to watch it in 3D or even 4D with the Dolby Surround System!"
"Those who complain about the lack of a story, where the hell were you for Minari and Nomadlad?! Yea what complex sophisticated stories those movies had right? (roll eyes). Some people are such miserable misers that nothing can make them happy, there is always some flaw, probably in their personal lives too.Anyway, my thoughts on Avatar 2:Originally due to the 13 or so years wait and the saturated movie market which had overdone vfx and 3D since the first Avatar, I lost excitement and had 0 expectations for this film, I wasn't even hyped to go cinemas, but hey, Cameron did it again, this is the film that raises the bar in being visually stunning yet again.I thought the story was nice and carried a good message. Not every movie is Joker or Fight club, grow the hell up guys!There is not a single boring moment in the movie and you follow the story well."
"How does a film focused on learning the ways of the water end with multiple drowning sequences? It was beautiful cinema wrapped in sophomoric storytelling - with the ultimate insult being the set up for another sequel. So much potential, so little payoff. There were at least a half dozen ways to connect plot points, weave in personal journeys, raise the stakes and, maybe, include the oneness of Pandora. It was not to be this time around. Even the ""hell hath no fury"" sequence seemed forced and out of synch with the moment. We cannot become the enemy to defeat the enemy, but that is exactly where we are left hanging... until the next one."
"This 3 hour long movie has the entire water arc to thank for being its saving grace---especially the intense climax and tragic yet beautiful ending (if my funeral ain't like that, I'm not coming). It was able to have an emotional impact on me despite the fact that I was beginning to doubt it would during the first half hour or so. Yes it was the slower parts, but I like slow movies as long as it keeps me invested with great dialogue, and that leads me to two main things I didn't like about this film.First, it felt like I was watching a game... so a main problem is the CGI being... effectively equivalent in quality to it's 2009 release. That was a HUGE letdown for me when I'm also seeing games with a much lower budget producing CGI that looks so much more real. There is no reason for this mid result after 13 years. It's unacceptable in 2022. Yes it was very beautiful, but I expect that and more from games not major movies like this one. There were also many times when the dialogue could be much stronger for the slower sections. I'm hearing lines that need to be put to death. With this world-building and characters, Hollywood needs to be more creative. Aside from that, the actors did well and held their own. It was a nice movie with heavy emotional moments that fell just short of its greater potential.It get's a 7.5/10 from me!"
"This didn't have to be 3 hours but I absolutely adored how 90-95% of this was a step up and visually stimulating to the eye. The way that the story presented itself was also a step up when compared to the first film.As someone who thought the first film was just ""ok"" seeing the second film not spoon feed information to the audience and focusing primarily on storytelling and world building made it really work for me.Though, there were a few plot points that were set up and I thought that they were going to be paid off by the end but it seems that they were either set up for a future film or forgotten completely.My only complaints really are on the pacing of the first act. Since it was a little drawn out and the pacing only got better when the A and B plots converged. The way that the B plot was presented had it drawn out and disconnected from the main theme of the film but it set up the main conflict of the film.Overall good movie and I'm glad that James Cameron wasn't talking out of his ass when he was gassing up his movie during interviews."
"""Avatar: The Way of Water"" proves, like its predecessor, that what groundbreaking VFX looks like and how that special effects can be used not merely as a prop only for visual treat but also to facilitate a world building for the characters to grow up and develop their arc. The CGI in the ""Avatar"" films do not merely serve the purpose of creating a razzle dazzle on screen but also to build an immersive experience that will soak you into the space that these characters inhabit. You have to be a part of Pandora to relate to these characters and Cameron goes leaps and bounds in infusing emotions into the Na'Vi characters whose every blink, sorrow, joy is not just brought about by the skill of the actors behind the blue skin but also a contribution of a revolutionary CGI that cuts through the blue skin and lets those emotions have an uninhibited reach into the audience's mind.The transition from land to water was not done haphazardly. Cameron takes it slow and as our characters learn the nitty gritties of this new world we learn with them the ways of the new clan. The creatures do not just come and go as fantastical beasts in this new world, rather we spend enough them to emotionally connect with them (just like Loak or Kiri in this film). As Loak and Kiri and Tuk go on a journey with these creatures, we are pulled into this journey with a magnetic pull that you cannot resist. As in the first part, Cameron once again delivers strong environmental message not through heavy-handed dialogues but through the actions which are a part and parcel of the greater narrative. We have message against depleting resources, against whaling and killing of protected species and speaks wholly in favour of environmental conservation.The actors are all brilliant, be it the recurring actors - Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, or Sigourney Weaver - or the new actors Cliff Curtis to Kate Winslet to the child actors playing the offsprings of Jake and Neytiri. In particular, Zoe and Sigourney are outstanding.The story is simple. But simple doesn't mean lacking or bad. Cameron loves keeping his plots simple but the storytelling technique leads up to an immersive experience, you will laugh, cheer, applaud, and cry. Yes, it is long clocking 192 minutes. The first half could have done with some cuts but never for once it will make you raise an eyebrow or look at your watch.You cannot also ignore the sound designers, sound mixers, the production designers and music composers and the cinematographer Russell Carpenter, all of whom gave their best to make the 13 years long wait worth every minute, worth every penny. And yes Cameron gets the emotions right this time too."
"Yes the story is pretty basic it's not the most complex story that was ever put into a film, but there are many excellent movies that can say the same. Titanic has an even more basic story than Avatar 2 and it's still a great movie. Terminator 2 is also one of my favorite movies, and the story is also very basic there, but it still rocks because of the great action scenes and interesting characters. In this movie what matters more and gives it the fun factor is the whole world that they created. If you want to see an interesting and beautifully made world that absorbs the viewer, then this movie is for you. If you want to watch film packed with huge plot twists, then it's probably not. Of course it's not as good as Cameron's The Terminator or T2 but it's an enjoyable movie, and the world they managed to create is filled with so many different creatures and locations is truly remarkable."
"It is Unreal. In a good way. Story is very fine, very simple. Not a mind-blowing story but not at all bad, the characters and the emotions (anything except script/story is amazing) are great. Everything felt real. But the Main thing is the experience, the visuals, the CGI.Now CGI when I watch it, I can tell out its fake or how it's done, but with Avatar: The Way of Water, I got lost in Pandora, for real. I forgot my mind was halfway focusing, looking for something to tell its fake, Like at the last 30 minutes, I sat there laughing none of this things in this universe, Pandora (earth actually) is real, none of those frames looked out of place, The experience is just ridiculously amazing.I really don't care what people says like this promotes Violence etc, it doesn't, watch the movie first, Humans in the movie are straight up worse in the first place, then story/script, it's something that needs to improve a lot to stand up with its other parts like the CGI, cinematography etc.I don't mind if it doesn't hit 2 Billion box office mark to break even or even 3 Billion for that matter (story was lacking, still waiting for Avatar 3 to see where it leads), because
This is the best and deserved sequel to the Avatar from 2009 (it's story also was simple like this one), the movie that set the benchmark for the future Film Industry and 3D CGI. Going to watch for the 3rd time (noob numbers, I know).I wanted to see Alita 2 so badly, was mad at Cameron for pushing Avatar 2, but watching this changed my mind, Alita can wait, that movie was also visually and script-wise stunning.Watching this just made everything with CGI, cinematography, score etc and the whole film experience (even Wakanda Forever, both of them Disney lmao, anyway Ludwig Score is amazing) look and feel outdated. High-budget (mostly CGI heavy) Movies coming later in 2023 will look and feel amazing, due to this movie's impact.*Spoiler* but that last scene fighting/escaping in a halfway floating ship, that being similar to the Titanic is some James Cameron pun I never thought I would see (just saw in Pitch Meeting lol)."
"The thing with Avatar: The Way of Water is that you keep coming to it, many times.You will enjoy the rewatch, you will get marble at the surrealism, you will start repeating phrases, you will start thinking more deeply about the secondary messages, about our connection with nature...There is just so many iconic scenes!At some point, you realize that even though the overall story is simple (and even with some plot holes), the emotions you feel while watching it are real and intense.Very few movies manage to do that.The acting done by the new cast is great, the kids did a great job Lang is awesome as usual, and Seldaña and Worthington nailed their roles are parents.So yeah, Cameron has done it again."
"The movie has some strong elements, and as expected, the visuals were the best part of the movie. The visuals being strong and colorful were a pleasure to watch.The movie is a little long, being 3 hours and 12 minutes, you can be a little lost in the middle of the movie. In my opinion, the movie could've been 30 shorter and would've been even better.Watching the same characters we saw in the first movie fit perfectly right in with the new characters was a pleasure.No matter how good the movie is, it is a little predictable and it's kind of disappointing that I could see where some choices the movie made would end.But no matter what, it is very pleasurable to watch. Good characters, strong visuals, and a great score, but a little long in the end.My rating would more precisely be around 7.7."
"Disclaimer: I watched this the way it was meant to be watched, in 3D Imax. 35y old. I have a big movie collection, and been a movie fan my whole life.This was absolutely spectacular. I liked the first Avatar, but I loved this. I rarely go to the cinema, but I would go always if there were actually more movies like this, in 3D Imax with stunning visuals. I'm excited that now this has been made, the others moviemakers must follow/adapt seeing how amazing this is. The only concern is if there is enough geniuses to make movies like this.Brilliant. Never gave 10/10 rating to any movie so far, but for the whole experience everything combined (story+visuals+3d+imax+cinema big screen), I've never watched something as good. Story is simple, but IMO beautiful. Doesn't need to be complex for this type of movie. 3 hours never went by so fast! Connection to and message about earth, spirituality, and what our reality is (with industrialisation and money grabbing) is amazingly transmitted through the characters' emotions.PS. Seeing this or the the first Avatar in 3D vs 2D makes a whole lot of difference. Always do 3D and Imax!"
"Decades-in-the-making franchises have one big mistake in common. They abandon their original audiences in fear of not being relevant enough. They think they have to pander to bros so they rewrite themselves to include the bro lingo and introduce and advance the new generation of characters. In just that way, the Jedi were discarded in The Force Awakens, for example. We know how that new trilogy played out.Avatar: The Way of Water is no exception. It abandons you, the viewer of Avatar 2009, as it abandons the forest and relocates to the sea. It does try to enchant you though, with new creatures and bodies, new ways of life, new reincarnations. And so the patchwork begins. You see the story of the Croods, prodigal sons, whale hunting, fallen heroes, sinking ships. The problem is that you have seen it all before and with a more profound effect.Will Avatar 3 find its grandeur? Remains to be seen, hopefully sooner than in another decade."
"Today I have watched this movie in 3d
Sorry it's not a movie
It's a once in a life time experience.You can feel the visual, creatures, tiny particles.VFX is the main highlight
Story is the emotional journey
Action sequence have awe moments
Acting was outstandingJames Cameron you are a genius.You cannot compare this with DC, Marvel or any other biggie film.Everyone should learn how to present the vfx to the audience.Specially bollywood director have some opportunity to showcase there skills with this kind of vfx in future.This is something extraordinary.13 years efforts and this kind of results.Hats off.You must watch this epic and magnificent movie .This is landmark of film industry.See u part 3,4 and 5 in James Cameron style."
"The new Avatar movie is the most beautiful CG you can ever see in the history of movies. Just beautiful. Would have never imagined such a fantastic visual carnival. If there is an heaven, that should be it.However, the story is weak. I mean really really weak. Nothing in the entire movie makes sense. Spider is a character that should not be there. How come the oxygen supply never ends is beyond my understanding. How did he end up helping the humans, why he is left with all the freedom to roam freely in the ship. His acting was far below acceptable as well.There is a heroic war through the end of the movie where all sea people gather up and attack the ships. Then they absurdly disappear. Why? I mean why??? Then we see Sully family heroics all through the end of the movie. Somehow sea people decide to go home and leave sullies to take over the show. We don't know why. Probably we will never know.The drama was just surreal. Not believable, not connecting. The last 15 minutes was plain boring.I missed the one and only original avatar movie badly."
"The movie is beautiful, the visual effects on another level, after all they did patent new CGI methods. BUT it is incredibly boring, it feels like at the same time nothing and everything is happening. The plot is predictable at best and non existent at worst. Some plot lines are utterly senseless other than adding drama and extending the film. I won't be watching the next one in the theater, if it wasn't for the money I spent, I would have left... Some scenes felt like they were replicas of scenes from the first movie, right down to the words and the movements of the characters (if you've seen it, you'll know what I mean). At points the dialog felt extremely childish..."
"As a person who enjoyed the first movie I did watch this on the first weekend. The animation was on par or a tad better than the first version.The character buildup was ok but the focus on the kids made the plot get sidelined multiple times. I get the need to develop new characters but the story needs to stand up for itself and the characters.The final plot was way too long and winded making it a feat to survive the entirety of the movie without just walking out.The audience seemed to enjoy it with an ovation towards the end but I personally felt tired after surviving the movie. Note, I watched in San Francisco."
"That's the real masterpiece, literally the new revolution in cinematography. Admired how wonderful water is animated. Especially when you know what an incredible work hides behind. Best 3D experience in my life is connected only with Avatar saga. That's why the main advice to watch: wide screen in cinemas and 3D!It feels that the story isn't ended, that's why maybe some people think it's light and simple but I disagree, I really enjoyed every single part. Maybe it's a little bit disappointing for someone to see our beloved heroes getting older and stepping on the second roles, but, that's the way of life, the way of water..."
"I just came from seeing this amazing film and was highly impressed by cinematic brilliance (Visual, sound effect and a well written story line).Let us start with the fact that we had to wait for 13 years to witness the sequel, but it was worth it. The introduction was a great way to pull in the audience into this new story, but yet linked to the previous film's narrative.To the young audience being introduce to Mr. Cameron's movies, please make sure to watch Avatar and then go watch the The Way of Water to get a full grasp of this remarkable plot which I am sure will develop a third film (In a lesser time frame).I have rated this movie a solid 10, because every scene was crucial to the development of building the perfect plot and giving each character their own personality. This is how a top notch director does it; feeling as if you are in the movie.When seeing this magnificent story, please do so in 3D to enjoy its full artistic, cinematic and capturing the essence of the plot.Although I rate the movie 10 out of 10, I have my complaints for how we (the audience) did not get to see more of the previous war from the sea folks, and then what happened to the rest of the forest folks as well.I was on the edge of my seat and was amazed, pleased and cannot wait for the third film to be release, in a shorter time frame; waiting for a decade does not help the fan's interest, with movies being dropped monthly.Fantastic film by James Cameron again, it was a pleasure to witness you work, thank you."
"In the first movie the story had a clear motivation and natural evolution of the plot but in this second part, the story is almost non existent. In entire movie, Jake and his family runs and hide from the company of RDA mercenaries deployed on the sole mission to kill them. It is very lazy story writing and makes not impact on the viewers. All other areas like animation, VFX, cinematography, sound etc are excellent but without a strong storyline, movie struggles to keep the interest alive during its entire length of 190minutes. At some point you feel like you are watching a NatGeo documentory on the marine life."
"Avatar 1 is one of my favorite movies, I guess that's the reason that I am too harsh in it.Overall, I have to admit the special effects part of the movie is amazing. Combine with new technologies, it actually give the audience another great opportunity to feel that planet one more time. All the details are great and the ship are cool.And I think Mr. Cameron really did try many new elements in the movie. We can see this point from many family scenes in this movie. It reflect how families is important to all of us. However I guess he haven't had enough time neither to express his ideas or incorporate these elements. The whole story seems like a pasta. There are many stories lined in there but they just intertwined with full randomness. In other words, the.motivation of each character is not sufficient to justify their actions. For example, the main character, Jack, often unaware of the consequences of his actions.Lastly, it really surprised that there are not a single part in this movie can actually touch my emotions. I somehow have the same feelings that I am watching a soap opera. I believe a movie is meant to bring impact to the emotions and it definitely failed."
"Rarely does someone improve on something as good as the original Avatar...BUT, HE DID IT!! No wonder it took so long for this next installment in the series to happen, not just in terms of special effects but in its story's presentation of new characters of the NEXT GENERATION. It took time for the two sides of this movie epic to get to the point in development that this story's confrontation discloses. Obviously, the military presence was just NOT GOING TO GO AWAY after all they invested on Pandora after all they put into it's exploitation. And, the other types of exploitation described in this movie of the seas and the sea people is undoubtedly a brilliant move and uniquely different from that other water people movie out there which was good in its own right! The Way of the Water is more spiritual with a definite heart all its own, however! Good movie, looking forward to the next!!"
"With over 85% of reviews scoring 7 or above I think gives a fair indication of the quality of the movie. For me who does fidget a lot, 3 hours passed without me even noticing, however I would recommend watching at Gold Class for the extra comfort. Just like the first the visuals are incredible and the new creatures introduced brilliantly done. The story line at times does make you scratch your head, ""how did the colonel know that?"" ""How can she be the daughter of.."" But honestly the story moves along at a good pace, and the big screen at times almost makes you feel like you are there with them.Certainly recommend watching this at Gold Class whilst you can, watching on DVD or a Streaming service will still be great, but it belongs on the big screen."
"They had 10 years to write a much better story than the first Avatar which in itself was not very clever or interesting. Sadly they opted to rip it off from the previous movie instead. By bringing back the same villain, having practically the same plot device (whale brain matter for $$$ instead of magic rocks) and only adding a dull revenge story. They seemed to even reuse the same dialogue lines from the first movie as well. Most of the new characters in The Way of Water were very poorly written, lacking personality or making poor decisions for no good reason. All of it did not justify 3 hours of screentime but left me disappointed too. The movie is visually stunning and the world building of Pandora is mesmerising but as with the first one - that was the only part that captured my attention. Not excited at all with the sequals. Having doubts that Cameron will take any risks or offer any new ideas to the series. If you liked the first one - you will enjoy this one too."
"The Way of Water is a grand spectacle like no other. It earns 8 stars from me purely as a visual experience. And it's absolutely worth watching just for that.Should you watch it in 3D? Why not. It is well executed and the effect is stunning... for the first few minutes. After that you forget it's there. If you wear glasses or just can't stand the 3D visors, you're not missing much watching in 2D.Unfortunately, The Way of Water feels small compared to the original. Plot-wise no one would accuse tWoW of being a epic. It is more a 3-hour episode in a mini series, than an Epic movie. Lot's of filler, that might be generously filed under world building.Usually this would earn any movie a much lower score in my book. But being awed by the stunning imagery, I am willing to accept that tWoW is merely setting the stage for future installments with tighter, more meaningful stories."
"There is nothing like it out there, not even close. The quality of the visuals is unimaginably outstanding, like coming from a much more capable future of cinema.Yet, this isn't one of the greatest movies, because of the writing and the direction. Plot holes allover, shallow acting especially from disposable ""bad"" characters, the exaggeration of human evilness takes away from the didactic experience, the story doesn't dive into deeper depths, which could happen in many ways. The sequence of the different scenes is problematic too. All of these are familiar, when we are talking about James Cameron."
"Avatar (2009) was presenting a humanitarian issue as the main case of the storyline. In this movie, that humanitarian issue was replaced with a personal issue related to the characters (revenge).And this is totally fine, until we see that this movie is copying the same story arch of the first movie. Even though the two movies aren't walk through the same line by sharing the same issue !To be more clear, the writing techniques are completely the same, both movies are repeating each other by the same arch.Another unsatisfying point, the spiritual rituals and spiritual music/songs of the first movie are missing in this one. This rituals gave the depth to the first film, with a very unique stunning vibe. We couldn't see this vibe in this movie.Over all, the music score was less than expected.Positively speaking, the art department and the production designer did their job correctly and stepped the game up to a much higher level in comparison with the first movie. Very unique and artistic set design of the islands village, outstanding costumes and props. Could not be any better.Visually, this movie is spectacular, joyful and outstanding!"
"This movie had so many opportunities to be great, but instead went the way of Marvel phase 4 with the never ending battle scenes and lack of quality story.I went with a group of 7 and we ALL agreed the introduction of the water tribe was great and the scenes with all the water creatures and training was awesome.That said. The ridiculously long fighting scenes had me praying that it would end. This movie could have been 2 hours and 15 minutes long just by cutting out the nonsense. I am in no way anti-gun, in fact I'm very much pro 2nd amendment, but this movie had such an abundance of battles and shooting that it really hurt the overall quality of the film and story. How about more character development and more awesome creature/animal interactions.This movie failed and succeeded at the same time. We've waited so long that we would have watched it no matter what, but if this is what the next installments will be like, I'll wait til I can watch it for free at home.Also, WARNING to parents, children 12 and under could have real problem with all the never ending violence. This movie is more graphic than the first when it comes to violence and the violence against the Sully children. You might want to watch it first, before allowing your children to watch."
"Should be the name of the movie. ""You loved the first avatar? We'll wait until you see them with guns!!!!"" I kept waiting for the movie to become an energy drink commercial and an American flag to be flying in the background of all shots. For as liberal as Disney and James Cameron pretend to be.... The had no issues with cultural appropriation and an insane amount of guns.. even the poorly timed teens with guns in a few seems. Boring film. Literally the exact same as the first one, down to the dialogue... but with an insane amount of guns almost to a point of a gun fetish. And a guy looses an arm."
"This film is technically brilliant, especially in 3D. The underwater scenes were like diving in Tahiti. The whale was amazing and I was glad to see the communication between people and sea creatures. But the characters are very stereotyped, so the women are mostly fearful and the men are largely courageous. Two thirds of the film is fighting, which was a major turnoff. That conflict could have been cut by an hour. It looks like the target audience was teen boys. And it isn't as good as the first Avatar, which focused on an environmental message and not on violence. Save your time and money and stream the first film."
"The Visual Effect is just unparalleled. The depiction of bond and relationships between Family and Race is so tender and smooth. Three Hour's long is total worth the ticket price. This episode reduce the Big battle from two to one, and focus more on the Life on the oceans of Pandora. And only the IMAX or Dolby Cinema can release the full potential of this film. So I only recommend people to go to these two types of cinema.The new characters are just amazing! I'm particularly the fan of Kiri. 73 years old Sigourney Weaver did a Magnificent job at portraying an 14 years old girl,I couldn't believe it was her acting until I saw the Cast List. She is so charming!!!!!!!"
"Overall: 6.2 is where I am sitting at. At first, right out of the theater, I was an 8/10. The visuals were spectacular, especially in 3D. I have always been fascinated by the biology of Pandora, and they had a lot of potential with showing different adaptations to the environment. Then I had time to marinate with poor writing and cultural appropriation.An anti-colonization movie is not an anti-colonization movie if it still perpetuates white savior tropes and steals from indigenous cultures. Down to different outfits/beading from African peoples and the stolen Haka from Maori culture. It is not a good look. This movie talks about respecting the Na'vi culture and environment while simultaneously stealing from real world cultures. Just because these characters are blue does not mean we can forget about the white actors behind the faces. Jake Sully's character should have never had locs. Spider should have never had locs. I could go on. Cameron is so close to hitting the point, but it passed by him.If the franchise continues like this, it should have never left 2009."
"The story continues the first movie
Visual effects are exquisite. Sound and editing as well. It seems that the director is obsessed with ships that sink and with the world under water,sometimes I thought I was watching Titanic again. I happen to watch it on an IMAX theater to fully appreciate the 3D art and of course all the sound. The plot is not as good as the first one. The music is good but not outstanding. If you want to see very good special effects go see it but bare in mind that it is extremely long at least t an hour could have been cut off. Don't wait for extra scenes after the end credits."
"The movie gives immense satisfaction for film lovers, really enjoyed watching it in the Big Screen with 3D & all special effects
The action scenes and the underwater scenes are too good to be missed
The Mediation part to calm the mind is so refreshing & helps you connect across the species
The story is gripping , but would have loved for more individual depth & power part in each character
Really missed the xray eyes vision which was part of Original Story was not provided this time for ocean view
Cinematography & visual experience is good
Editing could have been more crisp.But would definitely watch again."
"I didn't know what to think of Avatar: the Way of Water right after seeing it. I guess i could say that i have mixed feelings about it but since it's so fresh i'll say what I think of it right now and i might change my mind later. I'll start with the things i didn't really like: The marines Avatar did not work for me. Seeing a Na'vi with tattoos did not feel right and why did they think that adding tattoos was necessary. The return of Quaritch as the main antagonist was not the best idea in my opinion but that doesn't mean i didn't enjoy his presence. He was probably the best part of the marine Avatars. He was very fun to look at and i actually liked his relationship with Spider. But the way I would've done it is, i would've established a new villain with more of a Gus Fring (Breaking Bad) style. Someone that has very thought out plan and intimidating presence. Seeing the final fight with Jake against Quaritch felt like an MCU final battle. I would've wanted someone who uses their mind instead of brute strenght. I kinda felt like when you pick the same characters in a fighting video game and see which one would be the winner. Felt a little bland to me. Another thing that i didn't quite understand was when the Na'vi could understand the whale-like beast by communicating with their mind. Maybe i missed the part where they explained it.Now on to the story. It's the main issue for a lot of people but i kinda get why they kept it so simple. It's the second movie to a franchise so I knew that in the end, there wouldn't really be a conclusion. And Jake taking his familly and leaving their original clan because of Quaritch targeting them isn't really going to solve the issues with the sky people. The call backs to the last movie weren't done very well. The chieftain of the water tribe saying that they have to teach them the way of water and ""they will be like babies"" really fell flat for me.Now for the last thing i didn't like and probably the thing that i had the biggest issue with was, the kids. I get that they are kids and kids are impulsive and do stupid things, but they we're the only thing moving the plot foward. I think 75% of the movie was, the kids getting into trouble, the parents saving them and Jake being pissed off at his sons for doing stupid thing. I also think that Jake and Neytiri we're underused but i get why they did that because they we're focusing more on establishing the kids, who i think are going to be the main focus on for the next movies. But everytime i saw Jake and Neytiri on screen, i was enjoying myself and they weren't in the movie enough.For the things i did like. I saw the movie in cinema with the screen X and wow. The experience was incredible. Everything felt so real and people tend to forget that what makes good CGI, is not noticing what is real and what isn't. I felt the impact of the sky people coming back and burning everything, the flight scenes, the water, everything.On to the characters. Neytiri was my favorite character. Her acting and raw emotions in all of her scenes gave me goosebumps. She is just so badass. Her grieving for the lost of her firstborn son was very emotional and did make me shed a tear. Jake was also fun to see but like i said previously he wasn't in the movie enough and he was one of the best part of the last one. All and all, it was a very fun experience and i am definitely looking foward to the next one."
"This movie is absolutely worth the wait. Every frame was beautiful and there is so much passion and hardwork put into it. It's felt like a journey to another world, everything looks so real. The story is simple and yet there's something so beautiful about it. It really shows what a person with passion can achieve. Thankyou James Cameron for creating pandora. The character of spider was a confusing to me but I didn't care when the rest of the movie is this good. I've watched it in theatres 3 times already and I can't wait to watch it again. Can't wait for the next Avatar movie. I hope they are all directed by James Cameron."
"I completely forgot the story of the first Avatar movie, so when the movie started with a documentary-style intro to the world of Pandora, then swiftly dove into a smattering of spaceships, combat scenes, and raising children, loosely tied together with a thread of exposition (I think they were trying to make it subtle?), I was confused from the get-go. As the movie goes on, it takes up so many different storylines/tangents, but it manages to tie together somehow by the end.It's still confusing though. What was that about Grace having a daughter? I remember there were a few scattered scenes extending that backstory, and all I know is that she has epilepsy-or does she. (Also, is that really what epilepsy is? I'm no professional, but ""having visions"" seems too convenient.) There are those boys who get into fights: first the girl gets bullied, then Jake's younger son gets in a fight with them, then he apologizes, then that chief's son tries to get him murdered, then they both apologize for the same thing and then become actual friends-at least I think that's how it goes. I think Tuk is supposed to be the comic relief, so she gets effort points, but it just doesn't work with how gritty and serious the movie feels. And also, I still don't understand why that Paikon fish was considered an outcast, considering that it's quite obvious he didn't even do any killing.The more I write this review, the more I realize how many cliches there are and how disjointed the story is, and the more I wonder what I even watched.Of course the visuals are amazing, even more so since I had the privilege of seeing them in the immersive IMAX 3D. I like those ""tookoon"" things now, they have nice big pentagon mouths. And the girl who was oNe wItH tHe fIsHeS, she's cool, she's my favorite character.Soyeah!"
"This movie is an almost must see in the cinema, as the visual experience of watching it in 3D is amazing.Not only that, the message it carries is also beautifully shown, through the way the Na'vi are connected to the world around them. This is basically a continuation of the message from the first movie, but I think in here it is shown even better in the form of the Tulkuns (Whales) and how the experience the world and how Avatars are connected with them. You get a very good feeling how cruel humans can be towards other living things and that we are prepared to do horrendous things in our self interest.The reason why I didn't give this movie a higher grade was, because the plot was designed in the way, that a lot of very unlikely scenarios had to happen so that, things turned out the way they did. I also found that recycling the villain from the first movie is a little bit of a ""cheap"" move and that there were better ""villains"" we could have had. And the thing I found most annoying was that the Na'vi are too humanised in a way, that the behave and speak like humans living in a modern 21 first century city. Given, that their culture, physiology and the structure of personality should be completely different from humans, they should never behave that similar to humans."
"Like the golden vial this effort is based in marketing of greed. This movie is a feast for the eyes but the storyline is beyond empty and lacks logic. Many 'human' characters lack richness and character - without being provided dimensional depth and reasoning they leave the viewer questioning if the script / storyline writer actually was able to get what they wrote to the screen or whether it was manipulated by some 'marketing / profit return calculation algorithm'.Simply put the storyline is an insult to the intelligence of the viewer. Whether it was being marketed solely to an audience defined as that or the test audience was having giggle I guess I will not know but will live in hope someone decides to take this potential gem and do something unexpected (be original and intelligent) and decide to write scripts for all characters that actually make sense. Actually bring everyone to life because the visuals are amazing but the storyline contradicts and lacks dimensional richness. You are putting paper thin characters into a 5D perspective and that is not going to provoke a response that is moving in the direction you wish. Left feeling I just experienced a 3hr 15min void of being stuck in a pile of chewing gum. Certainly not feeling drawn to view Avatar 3, 4 and 5. By 2030 going on this tangent I will be paying more to watch silent movie reruns where I can imagine characters who actually have something to communicate."
This is a fantastic movie that is quite literally unrivalled in terms of visuals. I found it got you invested in the characters and the gravity of the situation they faced. I went into the cinema thinking it would be far too long of a movie to watch and found that it flew by quickly. It's engaging from start to finish in a way that is quite simply magical.I'm likely watching this again in 3D which will be a first. At the core of the Avatar magic the theme of bond and family. And we get to see the characters explore their role within this unit as they face an existential threat. Absolutely fantastic.
"I don't know how he did, but James Cameron has made a sequel to both Avatar and Titanic at the same time!!! All honesty it was a great movie, well worth the watch. Definitely must see at the cinema in all its 3D and Atmos glory. Amazing visuals as expected and a passable storyline with some obvious plot holes. But it is well worth your time to enjoy a cinematic experience like no other. I've finished my review but for some stupid reason I have to deliver another 150 or so letters. So stop reading now if you want only 78 characters left till I can post my review, I've managed to get down to zero."
"A visual spectacle no one should miss watching on a big screen. The best visual effects so far we have ever seen in a movie. Cameron is by far the best for directing and capturing such action sequences.As far as the story is concerned, it is quite similar to the first one and less consistent, However, 3:15 hr of run time is not enough. 4 hr would be better with enough character development and engagement. Some characters seem to be the unnecessary edition that doesn't serve any real purpose.In inference, it is an extended version of the first Avatar film with sharped visuals.Awesometecular..."
"The marketing for this movie undersold it. This movie is not the movie of a generation. No, it's the movie of a lifetime. Nothing could have prepared me for this beauty, James Cameron and his team have been filming for the past decade.Cameron called this the 'Manhattan Project' and he was totally correct, this blew me away about as hard as getting hit by an bomb would.The movie is 192 minutes, but no time was wasted. In all honesty I didn't feel the Lenny at all. The movie had a grip on me so firm that I properly could watch another hour and not get tired of it. I enjoyed every second. The movie is highly action-packed from the beginning.The visual effect is as close to perfect as can be. It's better than any other $100 million+ movie released so far, and will properly keep that title for a while. The 3D effects is simple stunning and we fall in love with exploring the waterline of Pandora.The movie has just a few little corny dialogs in the beginning. But they're overwhelmed by the a beautiful story and the best visual effects I have seen so far. It's an absolute must-watch in cinemas. It great to finally as a blockbuster like this. It has been quite a while since the last."
"Let's be clear. Avatar 2 is a thing of beauty. The animation of the sea, sea animals, and everything else is so fluid (no pun intended) that you can hardly believe it's special effects. The visual effects are bigger and bolder than those of the previous movie, to the point where I found myself in literal awe of what I was seeing.Now, let's discuss everything else. The storyline isn't exactly original: Lead character and his new family is in danger and must flee their home because of the lead character's past sins. We can basically predict how the movie will go (with some deviations here and there). There are new characters added (Jake's children, members of the Navi Water tribe, and the sea animals), but even they aren't enough to keep the storyline interesting. Don't get me wrong, there is plenty of action. The three hours literally flew by, and I was glued to the screen the whole time. But by the end of the movie, I was left wanting something more.As with it's predecessor, the idea was to present a visual masterpiece. Avatar 1 succeeded in that regards, and Avatar 2 raises the bar. But do not expect any Oscar-winning performances, well-written dialogue, or an original storyline."
"While the movie was visually stunning and groundbreaking, it was far from being amazing for the following reasons. I get it, every Avatar is trying to push boundaries of what technology is capable of, but at some point visual details don't matter and have just been done because the budget allowed it. What makes a good movie is not that there is ultra-complex and well done hair-rigs, super realistic water rendering or the best Motion capture animation that could've been made.For me at least, what makes a good movie is the overall artistic value and cultural value it can provide. Not to get into detail, but a lot subplots are not only senseless but also make an already extremly long movie even longer. Do we really need another 15 Minute Fight scene with loud explosions after we just had two? I feel like there was just a lot of potential wasted because someone in a high position decided they need ten subplots that add nothing to the main plot and don't push the story forward, but are just pure entertainment (for me these subplots were rather blunt and senseless therefore not really entertainment but rather a reason to keep me in the cinema seats for longer).I imagine it's very difficult to make a movie with a quarter of a billion dollars without writing and producing it in such a way that it has a certain level of kitsch and predictability for the masses."
"I have to admit, having seen the film twice, my opinion has completely changed. First time round I found it quite overwhelming and missed the finer details of the film, but seeing it a second time I thought it was absolutely fantastic and equally (if not more) emotional. I love how James Cameron is holding up a mirror to humanity about what we have done to our own planet. I went the second time with my family and they all loved it. All the new characters that have been introduced are so likeable and give Avatar a fresh new feel. Beautiful VFX, excellent acting, emotional story...I can't wait to return to Pandora!!"
"Great movie but I do feel like the first movie did better introducing characters, and tha cgi was more smooth, I wish I felt more sad about the older son passing but I didn't feel like there was enough of a connection to some of the kids. But it definitely will be on my watch again list. I liked how they started it, and the over all storyline. It was definitely left open for not only a 3rd but some fillers story. I but over all the whole movie was great and made me not want to miss what happens next. My only gripe really is the animations of some of the animals were really bad compared to the first, but it might just be it in water that gave it the choppy feeling."
"Visually the movie is obviously gorgeous. Not only in the jungle but also underwater. I also appreciate that they really filmed underwater, which required innovation in the motion capturing and learning freediving. There are also great action scenes.However, there are problems that I failed to ignore. A mild issue is the lack of character development. There is only a noticeable one in the antagonist.What is worse is that many new characters are hardly defined at all. Even one of the three children of Neytiri and Jack has lacking definition. I don't even now the name. Unfortunately (or conveniently) it is exactly this child that dies so it's hard to care.One child, To'ak, constantly tries to prove himself. He finds love but it doesn't get developed at all. He tries to be friend with the other boys, but this leads nowhere.He meets a whale which is subtitled even though he doesn't speak whalish. The whales are part of the family of the water clan but when they are killed further away noone cares. The whales write songs for the water clan but you never hear them. They know math but never show it. They are very emotional but when one whale seeks revenge for murdered whales and whales and na'vi that help him die in the process, he is expelled and made responsible for their deaths. On the other hand when a whale dies close to the water clan, they all seek revenge and blood.No matter what To'ak achieves, Jack isn't happy with him, because To'ak does risky stuff where Jack can't protect him. In the end Jack has the realisation that it is his duty as a father to protect his family...It remains unclear whether Kiri or the water clan can breathe underwater. One out of the water clan suggests to some of the jungle clan to simply breathe underwater. On the other hand they teach freediving technics and can use some fish to breathe. Kiri can definitely stay underwater for a long time but nobody notices. She can interact with the biosphere like nobody else can and plants and animals are clearly attracted to her but again nobody cares. Instead everybody thinks she is a freak and mentally ill...What I liked is Neytiris reaction after she looses her child. That was badass!"
"Avatar The Way of Water is basically the same as the first installment but with more characters that unfortunately aren't fleshed out well enough for you to care for them. The storyline of this second version of Avatar was basically almost exactly the same as the first movie 13 years ago. It even seemed that it didn't know which direction it wanted to go and just mashed up different events and ideas randomly together into a 3 hour movie, which eventually left you with an unsatisfying feeling. The 3D effect is however yet again top notch, you feel as if the characters were real and alive on screen, however I am afraid that the 3D gimmick has worn out over time, that 3D alone wont contribute significantly enough anymore to make a film watchable."
"There is a consensus: the story is not amazing, but the visuals are the best ever.While I can recognise the beauty of Pandora and the incredible work that was necessary to bring it to life, I fail to understand how that was essential for me as the viewer. Sure, they were able to film underwater and all that, but being aware of that doesn't really make the film fantastic for me, as the viewer. The picture is beautiful, and that's all I care. And well, if I forget the fact that some ultra-modern technology was used to make this movie, the only thing I get is... a beautiful picture. Nothing more.The story is mediocre and very Hollywoodesque. The script is full of commonplaces, which completely ruined the experience for me. It's a beautiful CGI movie, but being from the generation who saw all Lord of the Rings' movies in theatres I'm not easily impressed (talking about grandious movies with beautiful new worlds and engaging stories)."
"It's very butiful movie about animals life on another planet... in style BBC or National Geographic.Honestly, I was shamelly disappointed, I tried watch it 4 times before movie had ended, long, boring but impressively beautiful, such as video of coral reef on YouTube with bunch of small fish and butiful corals plus no ticket fee, and no perl in scenario.By the way, they can kill older son in the beginning of movie in their own place with same result and save 3 hours of our lives. I expect much, much more than just a Playstation or Xbox video game. And now I can considered that great movies from James Cameron in past. I estimated this movies (I no wants to even call it Avatar 2) in 6 stars for the reason to showing respect for the professional who made this disign not for storyline, not for scenario itc.. I'm sorry if I offended anyone but it's just my subjective opinion."
I rarely sleep through movies but I slept through part of this one and was considering walking out of the theatre...wish I had but hope springs eternal thinking it would pick up and become more dynamic but it didn't...the visuals were incredible and surreal and perhaps the only reason it got somewhere between a 6 and 7 from me but the story and character development was...well...flat as a pancake...I knew it going in and expected that ... I sure hope James Cameron hires another screenwriter for the sequels after this one...and works on developing some depth and dimension to the characters otherwise I probably won't bother and maybe watch at home on the tv with my kid.
"So 13 years ago we're in square 1 again, now with extended family members and not with one but two Navi tribes. Yeah, how original. I bet the writers were not very bright and took extra looong coffee breaks, to get done with this one. Another corporate bs, focusing only on the violence, war, enmity, division, instilling panic and fear, along with misusing natural resources. Sounds familiar? Oh, yes, so familiar that it hurts from the 3D reality we're all living it.We ain't that stupid, just because you slap a family sentiments on a political and economic driven movie, where it's all about killing and exploiting, doesn't mean you will fool us and present it as a ""ground breaking"" again. So many themes are wrong in this movie, lacking to convey any positive, uplifting messages, that would inspire e new way of life for everyone. No matter how much of the natural beauty you show in these movies, if the motives and the values are not set right, I'm not buying any of it. Very underwhelming and I'm giving it 6 just for the work crew, because I appreciate their work, but when comes to script writing, themes, messages, interpersonal relations.. it barely goes to 2.Go watch it once and make your own conclusion. I expect Avatar 3 to be remake of Avatar 1&2, now with neighbors. Thank you."
"Honestly i was blown away, i had high expectations and they were met, the CGI is something from another world most of the time it felt real. The whole time i was watching never once was i brought back to reality from the cgi not looking realistic, James did a great job building this world and universe that you want to get stuck in and live in even making you feel connected with the animals.The fact that this movie and the previous both were sort of a wake up call for what we humans are doing to our planet by showing humans do the same to another is impressive there was peace when it was just the navi on screen and as soon as the humans appeared there was an instant tension.And the story as a continuation from the first i thought was good, it left alot to be added on to, new relationships and new possibilities i only hope that miles wont be the antagonist for a third movie and that the story will change and evolve otherwise it will just get repetitive, also i hope we wont have to wait another 20 years for the next.All in all its an amazing movie that everyone should see, dont be afraid of the 3 hours run time!"
"I loved the vfx and everything, but tbh the story had so so many loopholes. They were like, sky people can't attack our people, let us come to water people so that they can attack you guys as well.The kids tested my patience all the time. They were doing exactly what they told not to. Also some scenes were unnecessary long. The whale or that big fish killing scene was I don't why, it made me feel so bad about the whole thing. It got too much emotional in the end.The story wise, this was nothing like the first one. I would still rate this a classic cinema experience with vfx and graphics upto the point."
"For a film that had 13 years in the waiting, Avatar: The way of water is visually satisfying, but nothing more.Given that it follows after Avatar, which was arguably the most awaited movie of its time and was also the highest grosser for 13 years (discounting the brief period that it was temporarily dethroned by Avengers: Endgame), the expectations were obviously through the roof for this sequel, and it delivered. Well, almost did. Well, at least in some departments.First, let talk about the positives:
Visuals: If Avatar told us what 3D is, the way of water reminds us how powerful CGI, motion-capture, creative imagination, vivid colorful canvases are at creating breathtaking visuals. The movie, especially the ocean scenes are unparalleled in cinema history, and probably will remain so until Avatar 3. You lose yourself in the flora and fauna of Pandora and don't want to go back to the real world.Character development: This is a big improvement since the first movie. There are tons of new characters, and this time the characters are more fleshed out and little more human and relatable. Though this improvement is limited to the Sully family and Colonel Quaritch.Now, let's talk about the negatives:
Storyline: The story is flawed to say the least. All the characters motivations in this movie are either stupid or downright absurd. RDA's motivation to send a new mission to Pandora isn't Unobtainium anymore, but revenge for Quaritch. Seriously? Jake's motivation to join the sea clan. First, what convinces him that Quaritch won't just kill the Omatikaya people, and second Jake's just involving the Metakayina people in his war unnecessarily, signing their death warrants.If I had to guess.. the only real motivation is Cameron's incessant urge to cash in Avatar's success and his obsession with the ocean.Duration: The movie clocks in at 3 hrs 12 minutes, and yet the story is wafer-thin. For all the hullabaloo about it, the ocean first features in the movie 45 minutes in. There is one particular scene which goes on for 30-40 minutes and story barely moves forward; not saying it isn't beautiful, it's serene, it's pristine, it's like poetry in 3D. The final battle also drags on for about an hour, and yets feels repetitive, reminiscent of so many yesteryear movies like Titanic, Apocalypse now etc. Many a times, the movie feels like a documentary about how beautiful and varied ocean life is.Underused characters: Apart from the Sullys and Quaritch are underused. Tonowari, Ronal and the sea clan are inexplicably missing from the final battle, which goes on for almost an hour. In the bad guys, it's Quaritch all the way, others are just there to make up numbers. General Ardmore is introduced as if she is going to be an important character, but disappears completely pretty soon.My favorite characters from this movie were Kiri and Lo'ak. Spider is another important character to look out for, I have a strong feeling that he'll turn villain in movie 3 or 4.I had a lot more to write about it, but most people won't read this far anyhow. I'd summarize it by saying that Avatar: The way of water is a worthy sequel, if a sequel was really required. I also think that this might just break Avatar's box office collection, though it's a tall mountain to be scaled."
"The CGI throughout the entire film was absolutely gorgeous, and it almost tricks you into thinking it's real life. The 13 year wait and 250 million dollar budget was almost worth it. I would have given it a 10, if the story wasn't somewhat pointless.Jake's just having a good time, he's got a few kids and everything's going pretty well for him, then suddenly the Sky People come back and are willing to destroy entire forests and everything that the Na'vi hold close, all to hunt down and kill Jake.Jake and his family are forced to leave their home and travel to other regions in Pandora, where they are eventually found and another war occurs, leaving them with the death of many creatures of Pandora, as well as one of Jake's kids.The story that contained so much death and destruction all in return for Jake's death seems a little forced, if that makes sense.All in all, absolutely beautiful CGI, creatures, and characters, and even with the average story, deffinetly still worth the watch, especially on the big screen while it's still in cinemas."
"Was looking forward to this movie. Amazing visuals but weak story and excessive violence throughout for over three hours. Basically a battle movie of high-resolution video game characters in a Myst-like CG environment. And, definitely not a pro-environmental movie. The movie makers seemed to celebrate rather than condone the violence in the whale hunt scene. Zoe Saldana's character was the best part of Avatar 1, but was unfortunately given too little to do here. Finally, the editing was jarring, which is surprising given there were four editors credited including Jim Cameron. Not looking forward to Avatar 3... or 4... or 5."
"The first movie was magical, Jake Sully was free and bold and simple... but he is a changed man in this movie. The extra weight and pressure of being a husband strips away his character, he was barely recognizable to me, but I guess thats life when you have more things to lose.Added onto this intense atmosphere are some convoluted themes such as how one kid hates his dad, another kid meets his dead dad, another kid wants to know who her dad is.So I think there is too many new people and places introduced without giving enough time for the audience to properly absorb the themes. I miss the simplicity and not too sure about what kind of message the movie wanted to convery as there was too many.With the negatives out of the way, I really enjoyed Naytiri performance, there's just something so captivating about her presence. The visual were stunning, I could look at them all day. It felt like magic as I have no idea how on earth they were produced. The family bonding was nice though abit pushed sometimes.Every scene felt like it was made with soul, and thats what I think I love most about avatar, the world."
"I'm sorry, but this movie was just too long. As amazing as the visuals were, it just didn't really make up for the first 2 hours of the movie. Though I did really love the battle scene at the end, and I also loved the whale thing (probably my favorite character), but I still found it a little slow towards the beginning. I liked some of the scenes in the movie, and enjoyed most of the storylines but it just couldn't keep my attention , and for most of it, I was just looking at the time wondering when it would end. Overall, it was a decent movie and I respect Cameron's work, but I would suggest a shorter movie next time."
"(Note: I watched this film in Imax 3D)I had high expectations for this movie. I am one of the few people who absolutely loved the first one, mainly because I saw it in 3D at the time and it blew me away. The story for the first film was weak I admit but the world they created was incredible and this film builds on that and everything is done with breathtaking realism.The story is much stronger and has real emotional depth. I cared about the characters and (ridiculous as it sounds) even teared up at a scene when a boy bonds with a whale. It look's beautiful and the sentiment behind all of it is beautiful.The level and expectation of great vfx has declined so much over the last 10 years that something like this where they've really taken the time and effort is much appreciated.I hope this is successful because I can't wait to go back to Pandora time and time again for future instalments. All the negative people on here need to lighten up and just enjoy the sheer spectacle of what is a truly groundbreaking film in terms of vfx.I'd also like to point out that I dragged my girlfriend along with me to see this and she absolutely hates Avatar.She loved this movie and has now been converted.One of us, one of us, one of us."
"I watched this movie on 3D screen. The visuals and under water componets of it were stunning. James Cameron does a great job. It makes you feel like you should live in Pandora for a while at least.The starts a few years after the invasion attempt. The sky people are looking for a place to settle instead of a mine. They are building their own civilization in Pandora. They create new avatars like the last time so that they can reach the island where the lead actor stays. Wheter they catch hold of them or not is the story.The movie seemed long on cards. I was shocked to see that the movie was over 3 hours. But in reality, it didn't seem too long. James Cameron does a great job in making that seem short by taking us into the world and giving us a great experience.For a while, I felt like we humans are no good. We just ruin all the beautiful things given to us for our greedy needs. The director did make it more clear in a scened where the humans hunt animals for no good. After all, we just want our lives to last longer. We don't care about the other lives on the planet. In one particular scene, there would be a long expanation on how they hunt. I was totally disgusted seeing that.The movie moves at a good pace and makes us feel like we are a part of it. I really liked the portions that showed the relationsips between humans and the animals. All that was fantastic.The climax was a little dissapointing though. Expected great things to happen. But they didn't. At the end, the crew just dissappears and is seen no where.All in all, one can watch the movie just for the visuals. One more pearl from the cameras of James Cameroon."
"As the first work was insanely good, I think that the second work, this work, had a little bad story.It's bad that I can't empathize with family stories at all. Maybe I'll come to understand when I have a child and become a parent, but for me now, is it possible for me to be such a strong motivation for my child or family ties? I can only question.The images were very beautiful, the 3D did not feel out of place at all, and above all, the HFR (high frame rate) images were too amazing. Involuntarily, I took off my 3D glasses and rubbed my eyes. ""Wow! This is amazing! It moves too smoothly...""Please watch it at an HFR compatible movie theater (IMAX, Dolby Cinema, etc.)."
"As expected, this movie has a great plot, fantastic special effects and highly convincing acting. However, yes there's an however, the fighting scenes take up most of the long film. I would have preferred to learn a bit more about the way of water, it's amazing landscape and the magic of the sea animals who can communicate with the local species including the bipeds. This is the same mistake they made in The Lord of The Rings trilogy. First movie: great! Second and third movie just a blood bath after another. I already know there will be an Avatar 3 but let's hope not the cliché war oriented movie. Surprise us with something unexpected!"
"What an impressive technical feat this team pulled off. It's more beautiful and at times better written than the original. Perhaps it's my expectations but I wasn't as impressed as I should have been. Maybe the uncomfortable budget chairs in the 3D IMAX at Regal Sawgrass made the experience worse.I did care about the characters more here. They are more laid out and not as cartoonish as the first. However, the story is better yet the execution and main revenge theme felt... cartoonish to the point of comparing it to a Marvel movie... but that may be a preference thing. With the top budget... Did I expect more... quality and originality?I do have an issue with so many cliches in this 3-hour epic. It's true, that to make a safe, money-making movie that creates a return on investment... you have to put some well-known scenarios or cliches. But I was jaw-dropped by how many cliches the writers fitted here.I feel that much of the movie especially the first half felt rushed. Strange because this is a 3-hour movie that is only the second part of a five-part epic. I didn't like what they did with the villain here but I guess they are doing the Star Wars trick that still works.Maybe it was the new technology of the first, but I was more impressed with the technology used such as the breathtaking scene in the first when the mother tree got destroyed. There weren't any scenes here like this but there were more innovative ideas.The best part was the twist when the son died. Not expected and well executed... as well as that other moment with the arm cut off.The violence was gloriously executed. But after a while, I checked the room briefly with my eyes to see if the parents walked out with their kid(s). One of the most violent pg-13 movies I have seen.Perhaps it's the most violent... I mean I have seen less violence in R-rated movies than this. This was more violent than any Matrix movie for example. Just a heads up if you are bringing children or want a family movie. It's not.One thing that did catch my attention that bugged me throughout the rest of the production was the eclipse scene. Either someone got too excited with the video game Halo and ""ripped it off"" or mere coincidence.There were a few instances that I almost laughed out loud due to the terrible writing. I thought to myself... with this budget and team ... how this get in here?Beautiful cinematography, the soundtrack was well done yet at times misplaced... but only noticeable if you have watched a lot of movies to spot the inconsistencies.I liked the movie and it sounds like I didn't but I have waited years for this and knowing the budget... could use a lot more polishing. Lots of potential with many sequences that went straight to ""I've seen this before"" but still, I had an enjoyable time.Overall it's definitely worth watching in IMAX 3D... just make sure you know what you're getting into and get comfortable seating (Cinemark).To recap, if you value pure spectacle over pure story telling. This is a masterpiece.Side note... I have never seen such mix of review ratings from known critics. There are awful 1 stars, 3 stars and 5 stars. All over the place.Technically 5 stars. Story, 2 stars. Writing... all over the place in terms of quality."
"Initially good but the Showdown is senseless Violence! Too long and repetitive commando violence scenes. Not suitable for children as a pre-Christmas film. In places very predictable scenes that you know from other films. Tension screwed too high unnecessarily. The ending doesn't really resolve anything either and points to another violent film. The CGI is consistently very good. The length of the film is too long, no one wants to watch senseless killing for so long. Not only is the film bad and it has good content, but it was spoiled for me, which is a shame. I will not watch the third part in the cinema and certainly not with children."
"For every dozen bad movies appears a magnanimous epic tale that hollywood magically reveals from its veil of shadow.AVATAR THE WAY OF WATER, a truly stunning visually decorative experience that casts light into the soul of the audience, leaves a soulful mark.Story :: Well written, carefully thought out and aligned with the values and vision of james cameron.Score : beautifully crafted epic well balanced to the screenplayVisuall effects :: groundbreaking cinema masterpiece, something that the film schools of tomorrow will teavh in its class.Characters :: well chosen and fit well with the storytelling.Screenplay :: beautiful and organic, it truly flows witth eas with the story and directionOverall- An epic cinema masterpiece, crafted slowly piece by piece im the inner mind of the brainchild (james cameron). Every scene carries with it its own weight, the philiosophy of life is articulated well. The spirtual underlying current is well balanced with the cinema making, leaving audience to gasp for more moviemaking, the grandeur of visual effects.Avatar, way of water is what the movies are all about, transporting the audience to a new experience, storytelling at its best. This movie will stand the test of time and breakthrough into new territory. I hope hollywood understands that nothing can match good story, characters and filmamaking. This movie is as good as the lifey that can be experience on PANDORA!!!!!Recommened to visit a theater and buy the blu ray as it geta released."
"I went to see the original Avatar a dozen years ago in 3D. Unfortunately I could not get the 3D glasses to work over my prescription glasses so I had to watch the movie as a 3d blur. Nevertheless I did find the film interesting and engaging and I imagined that it would have been really awesome in 3D. So I was really looking forward to seeing the new Avatar in IMAX 3D because I heard that they had 3D glasses that now worked much better with prescription glasses.After about 10 previews of upcoming superhero movies at the IMAX the new Avatar movie started. The 3D really worked. I had no trouble at all seeing the images. But after a few minutes the novelty wore off. I found the 3D did not add much of anything at all. In fact it started to look really cheesy and I was surprised at how phony it all looked. After 10 minutes I realized that I had not paid attention to any of the dialogue or characters and had no idea what was going on. It was a lot of talk, talk, talk but completely unengaging.I nodded off a couple of times and 45 minutes into the film I left and went home. So I really did not see this movie. Maybe it got more interesting as it went along. So I'm giving it a generous 5 based on what I saw. I am never going back for another Avatar. And I will avoid all 3D for the near future."
"This movie is visually beautiful, but masterfully underwhelming. There are three hours of nothing, everything in it is a recycling, the story, the little developed characters, so much technology and money and the only great thing there is a blue whale. If we take out all the characters and leave Quaritch and Jake, the story stands on its own. Everything happens in the water tribe, which are full of tattoo Maoris, they insinuate that they do a haka and it only remains in insinuation. The water tribe is so poorly developed that the only evolution is to have a medium flat and robust tail and arms with crab-like armor, because they do not have gills, hands and webbed feet; Harry Poter and his gillweed figured it out better. And because if they recycled everything, in this movie the marine biodiversity (non-existent) helps them fight the enemy, and how is it that we went from an invasion by a very valuable mineral to an even more valuable liquid extracted from a whale? Once again Disney doing it wrong."
"It's the Continue of a first great movie with a invader story like the story of the invasion of North America. The second part is stupidly constructed, decisions of how the story proceeds is one big Idiocracy!Anyway the movie shows how far we are showing nice graphics! It's just sad using the technology to tell stupid story's like this!Hope there will be no third part. Like in every series the quality decreases with every movie!...a minimum required characters rule sucks...

"Great visual effects but 10 years too late. I've been waiting each year with anticipation until about 4 years ago when I gave up.So, the film, my beloved Avatar 2 is finally here... Man I'm so disappointed. Where's the story line? Same plot, bad guys are destroying paradise...no meat to the story or anything, just bang, bang, shoot, kill, destroy and burn.. Could have been so, so much more.Loved the way the sea people lived, but that's about it. No real heartfelt moments in this forever awaited sequel. Effort was there, but not delivered. Would have been nice to see what actually happened where the first movie ended. I also find the beginning was very weak...Anyway, we waited way too long, like with Frost 2 and it felt flat. Star Wars was completely reinvented and got even more interesting with 1, 2 and 3..."
"As the title said, you will care about the characters by the end of your 3 hour journey through Pandora. Cameron and our cast have brought this world to life and have masterfully world-built and flushed out our characters. They each have their own persona and are consistent to that character in every decision.I a 37 male took my 7 yo son. We watched the first to get caught up since he had not seen the original. He talks about this movie on leaving the way he talks about his favorite CGI laden marvel movies.As far as the runtime we prepped by managing liquids. Most importantly the runtime never felt long. I don't know what you could have cut for me to still feel the way I do writing this review. We both walked away in aweThe wold was more beautiful than the first, didn't think technology was here yet for this. Extremely engaging and better then binging hours of Netflix. Ready to go back to Pandora for part 3.Ignore every review, see the movie in imax 3d!"
"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 yearsAs someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.James Cameron's direction is incredible, the CGI is insanely detailed and real, improving vastly on a predecessor that honestly still holds up. He also once again proves that he's one of few filmmakers to actually understand 3-D and uses it to its fullest. He even makes the higher frame rate good for the most part which is extremely impressive.I really love it. It movie took 3 hours and i never got bored, it was shocking.I can not wait for the 3 part."
"Loved this film! Saw in 3D with it without 3D it would still be a 10. Everything about it was great, the story, the messages from the everyone including the whales. It had messages that touched upon current state of affairs. It was long but I could have stayed longer. The CGI was amazing and I forgot I was even watching a movie. It was refreshing that their were some losses and a lot of of ugliness in the film because it makes you appreciate the gods and efforts of others to live and accept one another. It is a must watch and please try to see it in the theaters! Go alone if you have too. It is that good."
"Linear plot, predictable ending. Not interesting at all. The plotline is very similar to that of the first part, only in a new element. Even the main villain is the same. No motivation, no development.They replaced some elements of the plot. Now evil people are not hunting for resources (everyone has forgotten about it), but for a liquid that is extracted from smart whales. Wtf. If they can make clones, why not clone those whales?Added a few new characters, their contribution to the storyline is minimal.The third part will probably be underground or in a volcano.Yes the visuals are good. If you like discovery channel, you will like it. If not-you probably go asleep."
"They took a fantastic movie and ruined it by taking the original, dipping it in water and repeating it. What an opportunity it was to blow this one out of the water. Plot holes, tired characters and massive lack of Oomph.Recreating scenes like Neytiri sobbing while the world burnt around her worked so well in the first bit was boring and over used in the second.Bringing Quaritch and Grace back took away the strength of the first movie.Plot holes and predictability made the movie a really sad let down. Visually stunning, yes. But not a patch on the first.Watching it in 4D was the best part, so if you do go then get the full experience."
"The movie has stunning visual effects overall. The scenes underwater were amazing and with 3D, it felt real. However, the story plot is very similar to the first movie with no new breakout in the story. I like the addition of new characters but I feel there was no need to make a second movie for Avatar. Also, the ending indicates there will be a third movie and maybe more. Disney should have focused on new movies rather than doing sequel for Avatar. The movie was very long (almost three hours) but it was very similar to the first movie. Thus, I give it seven out of ten overall. I recommend for watch."
So I was really wondering how this movie would be!!! And it was just amazing!!! Literally I can't understand anyone saying anything bad about this movie!! Like I love the feeling you get from it and the family is actually AMAZING. They are so tight nit and just such a Joy to get to know their love for one another. I watched it opening Night and I will probably go see it again that's how much I loved it. I've alwaaaays loved avatar. And this one just UPPED the WHOLE game. You can feel the dedication all the actors producers and directors have to this movie. Avatar movie seriously changed my life and this one did too. I'm so happy it finally came out after all these years. Can't wait for the next one.
"The newest James Cameron's Avatar movie is back after 13 years, it releases 14. December 2022 here in Norway. I saw this movie in December with my friends and now I'm going to tell you what was good in this movie and what was bad.After the Skypeople leave the planet Pandora, Jake Sully (As a permanent Avatar), become a husband with his wife, Neytiri, and his kids: Tuk, Lo'ak, Neteyam, Kiri and Miles ""Spider"" Socorro. They live a normal family-life until the Skypeople returns for the second time and Jake Sully decide to leave to a place where the Skypeople can't find them. The Sully-family travels to the ocean part of Pandora and find the Metkayina clan where they decide to stay.The movie was played by good actors, but my two favourites was Sam Worthington (As Jake Sully) and Sigourney Weaver (As Kiri). Sam played very good as a good and caring father, that really care about his children, and I also liked one of his children, Kiri (Played by Sigourney Weaver), that played here ""Emotional challenge"" very well. The rest of the actors was great, but this two was my favourites.The movie was in my opinion one of the best visual-made movies ever. The effects and scenes was perfectly made, and the story was heartbreaking and interesting. One of my favourite scenes are when Lo'ak (One of Jake's sons) become friend with a whale called Payakan. What I didn't like was that the movie was to long (3 hours and 14 min long)The question is: Is this movie necessary? No. I think that the movie was not necessary because the first movie was enough from this universe, but still, I think this movie also is necessary because we got new family members, Pandora Creatures, new biomes and a new fantastic adventure.What I learned from this movie is that family must stick together, and you must trust others. I also learned that coming to a new place can be very hard and difficult, and that's why we have to be nice to each other.I recommend this movie from age 12 years and up, and I also recommend this movie for people who like Sci-Fi and Action movies. I personally love this movie and I want to watch it again once in the future.My final rating for this movie is 9/10, for best visual effects, actor performance, action, family-drama, and cool fantasy creatures."
"AVATAR 2 was a really amazing movie for cinema lovers! This is a movie worth seeing on the silver screen not at home! It has extraordinary CGI! Even the new indigenous tribe had subtle new features and you can see every crackle every wrinkle every physical feature you can see in real life! Every little skin detail is visible on both avatars and alien creatures! I can hole heartedly say it was worth the years of wait! I have to admit that the plot line is a built up for avatar 3! But the creativity of producers is a 10/10. The colours the creatures the landscape, all impressive! I'd definitely watch it again with pleasure!"
"At one point someone dies I guess and I'm like oh was I supposed to care about this person. None of the characters are fleshed out in a way that makes me care about them. I don't care about jakes stupid kids and spider boy. Another thing I don't care about is misuse of technology.I found the variable frame rate to be very distracting. Why did we need to keep shifting back and forth. I found when it was 48 fps the action felt like someone hit the fast forward button. Which is dissappointing because I found the visuals were very stunning whenever Cameron allowed my eyes to linger for more than a millisecond.Overall, Very disappointing to say the least. The first Avatar film is a labor of love, something really special. This is just another soulless corporate franchise film."
WOW. What a great experience to see this movie in theater. I saw Avatar 1 but this is next level. All water scenes are amazing. I can recommand this movie to everybody. You need to see this in the theater. I saw in in 4D great and funny. A real reason to go back to the theater again. And yes the story is not the most spectacular part of the movie but the visuals are compensatting a lot. I spent more than 3 hours in theater. That's a long time ago. And I didn't find it too long. My kids were even more surprised than me. Even my wif liked the fatasy movie she normally hates it. Absulutely great idea to go.
"I loved the original Avatar. Watched the 3D version four times in theater. I appreciate that many people put their blood sweat and tears into the sequel. I validate their hard work. I appreciate their time. That said, at the end of the day, the product is turned over to the consumer. I paid for my family of three to watch their 3D movie. This consumer was supremely disappointed with the direction the series went.The plot and script were criminally bad. It's like JC turned the whole thing over to his ""C"" team, made up of teenage boys, lead by a psychopath. Only a psychopath would make a movie run three hours with a plot this moronic. Of all the directions you could go in this new world, only a psychopath would use the children as done. Then, release the movie at Christmas! Seriously, only a massively troubled individual would think these things up. There were so many directions it could have gone. Any group of teenage girls could have written a better and more appropriate story for the Avatar universe. If the goal was to show the tragedy humans bring to the ecosystem or the human misery perpetrated by Europeans on American and South pacific natives... mission accomplished. Could have released that in the spring though."
I must say i am a fan of great visuals and sound so i like this kind of movies. Only thing that bothered me in this movie was the last fight. Everything started ok fight begun then after few minutes in all the water people fighting where cut out like they went home and last half an hour only sully family fights. Director focused on main characters so much they forget to include everything else in the action. When fight was over then they where again together with the water people like something was missing inbetween i gues some cutting was done because then movie would be like 4hours long but last sully family solo could be done diferently in my opinion.
It was amazing and I can't wait to see the next 3 movies and hopefully 6 & 7 if people stick around. The movie had all the origanal main characters and has new ones like the kids of Jake. It has all the clamatics that a good Sci-Fi movie should have. Not many other Sci-Fi movies in my books rate as high or higher than Avatar 1 & 2 so far except for maybe some predator and alien movies. It also has teasers for the next movie also. I can't wait til 2024 Dec. This is the one of the best overall frachises there is and could be. I hope yall enjoy it as much as I do because it really and truly is amazing.
"The first thought that came out of my mind after watching the Film was ""Exhausting"".Yes, the movie is lengthy , 3hr 10min.Let's talk about Positives and Negative in the film.Positive:
1) Stunning Visuals.2) Excellent choreography and Direction.3) Bgm is good.HERE WE GO:::: Negatives.1) Big Red flag- long runtime
2) I am shocked to say, bad Screenplay.3) First half was supposed to be slow because of new characters and new world building arc, totally understandable, but SECOND HALF WAS EXHAUSTING.4) Story lacks in setting up any goal for the film. I felt like story is not moving forward, and at the end of film, it ends where it starts only with some minor progress.5) Bad Character development, couldn't connect much.6) Felt forced while bringing the dead characters back, and movie has no purpose or goal.7) Movie has no Antagonist or Protogonist, atleast Jack sully was not a hero for me in this movie.8) Not a single over the Top scene, since it's James Cameron movie I expected too much.No new creatures were shown apart from what shown in the Trailer.9) The visuals underwater felt normal and not revolutionary, overrated. This movie could have made in 1 year.10) Bad dialogues, lacks humour, and doesn't keep intact to any characters.11) Action scenes are just okay and not over the top. Mediocre.Finayl verdict : Exhausting movie with great visuals, just a one time watch."
"It have good cgi but story is as stale as a food can be.Basically it's a very average family movie story.Jake sully the main hero of the movie was not used at all. They could have made this movie without him.No magic moments in movie, just a good cgi and VFX.They wasted this part in introducing his children and specially Grace daughter that she could be a superhero in Avatar movie.Representative attempt of losing kids and fighting to get them back was a loop.Apart from new kids, all old characters are live now as a Avatar no that itself a bogus attempt to continue story.It just doesn't make any sense."
"Ugh. Where do I start. This sequel somehow(in my opinion) is even better than the first movie. Hard to do? Yes. Well for anyone except James Cameron(remember Aliens? Better.) Ok so it's beautiful and touching and you walk out wishing our world was this beautiful. And also realizing how humans really do ruin everything. Haha Let me just ask, do you know how hard it is to cry silently in public?! It's really hard. And I had to do it about a dozen times during this movie. And even at the end I up'd the anti with a full on silent UGLY cry. So you may cry a lot if you're like me. But if you're not like me, then you'll just find it beautiful and also very emotional. Go see it, you won't regret it. Even if you walk out of the theater with puffy eyes like me."
"Beautiful, moving, great story-telling and a lovely experience. And the visuals were stunning. I highly this next chapter in the Avatar saga. The actors were solid, the animals felt life-like, the sound mixed perfectly with the grand scenes. This further cements James Cameron as one of the greatest directors/writers/sorry-tellers. We should all strive for meaningful stories, complex characters, deep moments of highs as well as lows. And you need to see this wonderful movie in 3D as the movements, the colours, the animals and the creatures all pop out of the screen and into your heart. Such a blast!"
"James Cameron is the director of the action-adventure movie ""Avatar: The Way of Water."" The amount of time it took to create the 3D visuals made this movie mind-blowing. This movie has incredible effects. It was beautiful to see a film where the visuals took up most of the time. James Cameron utilized his position as director to elevate the performers' performances and increase the tension between the characters. The script, which James Cameron wrote, was astounding because it gave each character a chance to shine. James Cameron created this atmosphere in a mysterious universe far from the present. They had much more advanced military and technological capabilities than we do. It was exciting to see the actors perform; they all did a fantastic job. Because they visited many locations, the story's narrative was exciting and thrilling. They discovered additional opportunities to learn new skills and connect with others of like species. When Jake and Neytiri's family had disagreements with the light blue species, it caused tension. A few hilarious scenes in the movie had me laughing out loud and kept me watching. Although the film was lengthy, it was well worth seeing, and it will quickly become a box-office success."
"I watched it in 3D and I really enjoyed it. When I watched scenes under the water I just wished I was there... As much as I was annoyed by Spider saving his dad, it was realistic. The story reminds me of how we ruin our planet. It was also very amazing that you can watch this if you haven't watched the 1st part. When I went to watch it I didn't watch part 1 and understood almost everything. It is very approachable imo. I dont really have anything else to say but word requirement and I'll try to say something else. I just felt very happy when they kicked out the ""sky people"" from the planet once again."
"Avatar 2 The Way Of Water !!!!!2022 Cinematic ReleaseJames Cameron's mind wants the audience to learn more and understand the na' vi Race and learn more about their world and how the human race is set out to take over their beautiful world as the earth is dying.The hidden message is that human race is out there to distruct, they destroying earth and moving along.A spectacular visual film that starts abit slow however picks up and becomes one of the great films of the yearThe story, the characters, the score and visual effects are spectacularThe story may have been slow and not on the grandest scale yetThe film is still epic and Beautiful has 0 woke propaganda and amazingly visual to watch. Loved all the characters and James Cameron is one of the best directors in our lifetime."
"When I first started the movie, I absolutely loved the introduction, it showed the fact that they had children, and what exactly happened to everyone during the time jump. It did it so perfectly, from the acting the visuals, the dialogue, and the pacing. Everything was going to well.Though, the rest of the movie lacked the pacing, some, and most scenes were paced either, too long, or way too quick. Over half the movie was way too fast paced, such as, the flying scenes, the bonding scenes (with the adults to the children, and the children with other children), and the none violent scenes. The violent scenes, were either too slowly paced, or perfectly paced.I completely understand why, I do know that the movie was already too long, but it felt so quick. The acting scenes were incredible, and I absolutely loved the character development, and how much the movie series has changed.But what I would like in future films, is more Jake, and less of his children. Incredible movie, 9/10."
"First of all, the movie keeps what it promised. Great animation, world and nature. The length of the film makes it possible to dive deep into the vibrant and thriving culture of the Na'vi. Also, I could take my time to enjoy the beauty of the sea and it's nature on Pandora.The animation is significantly better than (the already great) first movie. The scenes under water are the most fantastic ones. I remember them as if I just watched it.In my personal perception, the action scenes and fights are too long. They could have shortened them. But it doesn't disturb that much.However, there was one weak point that can't be ignored: the story. The reasons why humans came back to Pandora make little to no sense and seemed just to be a self-critic message from the author. It's a collection of some bad, egoistic and greedy motives without any plot/context. It's very unfortunate and the reason why I have to reduce 2 stars. The author can't just make it easy to let the bad guy do bad things just because he is bad.."
"This film was technically very amazing, brilliant CG, the live human characters fit in perfectly. There is still some uncanny valley feeling to the Avatars themselves but otherwise beautiful.I did think some of the higher frame rate parts made the film look like a video game but that could be the fact I saw it in 2D not 3D.But that's it, it didn't draw me in, didn't make me feel anything. It was like watching a 3 hour long screensaver of magnificent images.Overall it's a very forgettable film, it will be great for the technology advancement it brings to the industry but otherwise I don't personally get it."
"BRO.This word sums up half of the script. For some weird reason they decided to portray the characters as wannabe ""from the hood"".The story is not convincing at any point.The graphics are of course incredible, full of colors and magnificent landscapes, the underwater world of Pandora is phenomenal and that part deserves 10 stars. But the story sucks. It is childish with lots of loopholes and u explained nuances that leave you disappointed. Why is the movie mostly in English? It is really weird and not authentic at all. I recommend to watch it only to see the amazing world of pandora and to enjoy the special effects- the movie itself sucks!"
I'm not sure how anyone of right mind can possibly justify rating this less then a perfect 10. If you watched Avatar in anything other than IMAX 3D then you didn't really see the movie. Visually the film is practically flawless with relentless breathtaking action sequences weaves into the masterful storytelling. The groundbreaking water simulation is just the tip of the CGI genius at work and it is practically impossible to distinguish what is real and what is computer generated. I have no idea how long this film took to make but I would imagine that when the button was hit to render these scenes the lights in peoples houses in the neighbourhood must have dimmed as the servers went into overdrive!
"I'm going to be honest with you: I was not a fan of the first Avatar movie. A lot of people love that movie and I'll admit: I used to be one of those people but nowadays, I find it pretty boring. In fact, I think it kind of sucks. Yes, the movie is visually beautiful, has some very strong acting performances and has a few good moments but is held back by a been there, done that story, hollow and forgettable characters, awkward dialogue, terrible pacing and a weak grasp on it's message. Upon hearing that a sequel was in the works and it would feature the kids of the leads of the previous film (Jake and Neytiri) as well as Stephen Lang coming back and Sigourney Weaver playing of the kids, I thought this was going to be a disaster despite some impressive trailers.Come opening night, I see it in a 3D showing and for the first half of the showing, there was this little girl who was like six years would be talking nonstop and I think I heard people say ""shh"" like seven or eight times. I get that she is young and seemed to be enjoying the movie but it did get very annoying. For about a good hour, she remained quiet but once the final battle happened, she became the loudest she ever heard was and the second the movie was over, I turned to the woman sitting beside me and just said ""that was the most annoying kid I've ever seen in a theater"" and she responded with ""yeah, right?""Now I'm done talking about the awful theater experience, on with the actual film: I enjoyed it a lot. I think it's an improvement upon the first movie in basically every possible way. I think it has more interesting characters, a more interesting story, better visual effects (obviously), more memorable action sequences and on top of that, this movie is over three hours long and I was never bored for a second and I've seen this movie four times already and I didn't even like the first one so if that's not high praise, what is?First of all, the idea of the Jake and Neytiri being parents and having some kids is something that on paper sounds disastrous but in execution, works really well. Three of these kid characters get really fleshed out and their development is only going to get better with every new installment. It seems like a trend to have a bunch of kid characters running around in a movie or show going on adventures nowadays. That can be very disastrous but here it works well. The whole film revolves around these kids and if you don't like at least one of them, this film will not work for you.I especially liked the middle child ""Lo'ak"" who at first comes off as a bit emo and an edgelord who throughout the course of the movie makes baffling decisions and at the end, one of these decisions results in the death of his brother (there's even blood on his hands to symbolize that he's responsible for his brother's death). He also has a bit of a Hiccup and Toothless thing going on with a whale creature named Payakan. All of these scenes were beautiful both narratively and visually. He also idolizes Jake but feels like Jake doesn't love him the same way he loves his siblings which comes full circle at the end when they save each others lives and there's the ""I see you"" scene (I thought that quote was just stupid romantic dialogue in the first movie but here it's pretty beautiful.) In a lot of ways, he's the main character of the film and is way more charming and likable than Jake ever was. Throughout the first movie, whenever Jake succeeded in something, I had no reaction. Whenever Lo'ak succeeds or comes out on top, I'm just screaming in my mind ""yeah!"" Anyway, I thought he was great and the child actor gave a fantastic performance. His love interest was not that interesting though but maybe she'll get more to do in the next movie.Next there's Kiri who's played by Sigourney Weaver which is pretty odd but her character was pretty interesting in my opinion. She can control the environment around her like Poison Ivy and like Lo'ak is a bit emo and sometimes I could really tell she was Sigourney Weaver but other times, I bought her as a 14 year old. Then there's Spider, who's the Tarzan looking dude in all the promotional material. He's okay. His performance left a lot to be desired but I'll go easy on him since he's a kid actor. Interesting idea for a character for sure. A human who wears an oxygen mask too and runs around with a loincloth with Na'vi characters. Sounds awesome. He also has a bit of a romantic thing going on with Kiri which is a bit weird considering the the ages of the actors but I'm sure they'll find a way to make it work. It's revealed that his biological father is Quaritch, the boring human general villain from the first movie played by the insanely underrated Stephen Lang. I'm not sure how that's really possible but whatever, I'll let it slide and he forms a bit of a friendship with a Na'vi clone of Quaritch. The other two children Neteyam (the one who dies) and Tuk (the one who's like seven and is just comedic relief) were super flat and forgettable.Now that I brought him up, let's talk about Quaritch: a massive step up from the first film. Here, he actually has some depth to him and is more than just ""I'm an evil military commander"". He's not really the same character if you think about it. The most impressive thing about him is that he doesn't have a single on screen kill and yet James Cameron successfully created a charming and charismatic antagonist. And I gotta give credit to that. Something I haven't heard people talk about is the final battle which I thought was way better in this movie. It wasn't a high consequences thing that it was in the first movie, it was more focused on the characters and they own struggles in a small scale battle in the middle of the ocean.Sadly the same can't be said about Jake and Neytiri. They're the same boring characters. Nothing against Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana, I think they're fine actors and seem like nice people but I don't really like their characters. Jake is a little better in this film but Neytiri has basically no development at all. I think I like the one Na'vi commando clone who is also the ""get some"" guy from the first movie. At least, he has some personality. Although I did like the scene where they see the brother character in the afterlife at the end, that was a really good moment and I'm sure anyone who's lost a child felt something there.Visually speaking, the film is a Marvel. Every single bit of CGI looks so good that whenever a human (besides Spider) was front and center, the film somehow looked worse. The underwater scenes stood out heavily to me. This is easily the best looking water I've ever seen for any movie ever. It just makes you to actually go swimming which is saying a lot because I'm terrified of the ocean.I've seen some people saying that your opinion on this movie will basically be your opinion on the first movie and I can't agree with that at all. I thought this one was way more detailed, deep and emotionally satisfying than the first movie could ever be. I also saw some people say they thought the first movie was better. I don't know why because this movie is better than that one in basically every single aspect besides maybe some of the music (Rest In Peace James Horner).Overall, I enjoyed the movie a lot. I know you might be reading this review thinking I'm overhyping it but I've seen this film four times already and I've liked it more every time I've watched it. There are some flaws like a couple of plot holes and stupid narrative moments like the immortal whale juice throwaway line, Payakan saving Lo'ak out of nowhere from being eaten by the shark thing (which was admittedly a pretty tense scene) and the water clan disappearing halfway through the final battle. Not to mention some inconsistent frame rate issues. Beyond that, I really have nothing wrong with this movie. Do I think the majority of people will prefer this one over the original in years to come? Yes. Do I think the third film will be better? Probably. Do I think when it's all said and done, Avatar will be one of those franchise that can repeatedly be binge watched like The Lord Of The Rings trilogy or the original Star Wars trilogy? Guess we'll have to wait and see."
Watched it in a Dolby theatre in 3D and I was blown away. Spectacular visuals and specially the variable frame rate made the experience even more believable and immersive. It 3 plus hour movie but worth it. Someone who has not seen the first one may find the first hour a bit confusing but can still enjoy the experience. It's a must watch in in 3D. 2D won't make you part of the world that James Cameron created.I was a bit skeptic about some negative comments in other reviews but I felt the movie very fulfilling. It connected well with the first one and this can be considered right way of moving the story forward. Go watch and enjoy.My theatre gave a standing ovation at the end.
"As soon as the first movie left its mark years ago for the amazing 3D effects and special story, the news came out for the second movie in the plan. Back then this was the best film made by Hollywood at the time.Considering the lack of inspiration that is surrounding the movie industry lately this is quite a well made film. It immediately continues and builds on the last one, with an exiting opening scene. It hits the spot and launches its refrain during the introduction of the Island scenes and the amazing colorful effects that accompany it, keeping to the same concept line of the first movie, which in this case IS NOT the wrong thing to do. I kind of half wished they explored Ewha more but its OK.The exchange of story with reality and inner world of the first movie is missing here but it also makes sense because it takes it to the second part of the story, the WATER world of an exquisite new world and the dichotomy between the jungle world and the water world in the Island. Jake Sully character has been transformed into a more dramatic lead character that inspires better relationships than a salvation terminator that the first movie was able to portray but here Toruk Makdo is BACK and his kids are even more feisty.The villainous factor is down a bit as the enemy is not as bad as might have been built, but it still manages to play the act well. I am glad that it kind of resembles ""the Abyss"".In the end the movie is very good, even though is missing a bit from the magic of the first one. But a very worthy second act by James Cameron."
"No Spoilers! This film would have probably have been rated R if it came out a few years ago, and I'm not complaining! Seriously though, i was surprised so much blood and gore (and female nipples) could still get a PG-13 rating.One thing that also surprised me, was that even at 3+ hours, it didn't feel too long or bloated. The pacing and character arcs were excellent, and i got emotional a few times, and by the end was in tears. I think personal life experience will factor greatly into how each person responds to the film, and if you've experienced loss of a close friend or family member, it just hits much harder.It's probably important to watch the first film before this one if you haven't, since there's many call backs to various plot points of the first film. The graphics are obviously very impressive, especially when you realize that probably 80-90% of the shots/scenes are 100% CGI. Rendering and simulation technology sure has improved dramatically in past few years. The cinematography is outstanding, as is the music and every other part of the production. The acting is also excellent good, and i personally think every role was perfectly cast. The story to me wasn't as superficial or shallow as some early critics had suggested. I assume they went in jaded and determined to hate the film or had some preconceived notions about what to expect. I went in with minimal expectations and was blown away. I'll definitely be watching this film again!"
"«Avatar the way of the water» is a movie that needs a whole category just for itself.Going straight to the point, one thing in particular takes the movie farther then moon Pandora where the avatar live, or any other habitable planet in the galaxy:
-The graphics.It has simply not been done before. 3 hours of awe, you have a hard time getting used to the scenery and the levels of details. All that combined with a feeling of incredible scenographic smoothness (parts of the movie are in 48fps instead of the usual 24fps cinema standard) which I loved! The smoothness of each body movement or splash of water gives you the chills imagining how long it must have taken the animators to perfect.The creativity of the underwater life is very pleasant to discover as well. Creativity on the graphics definitely not lacking throughout the entire movie.On the harsher side, there are some details of the movie I'd really like to be made clear which I will not spoil.I personally didn't see the 3 hours pass, and that's a good sign on its own. I think there aren't any people I wouldn't recommend the movie to."
"To all the reviews that claim the movie has a terrible or nonexistent plot, why did you see the movie in the first place? Avatar 2 has the EXACT same plot as the first one, so if you thought this was bad, you must of thought the same for the first Avatar.Avatar 2 does indeed have the same plot as before - except now it's in water - but that is okay because it was a good story to begin with. On top of that, it's worth seeing this movie just for the CGI. Animals and Na'vi move through water almost like you're watching BBC Earth. It makes the recent Aquaman movie laughable. At slightly over three hours, the action does die down at times but I found I didn't really care because the movie was focused on character development and cultural understandings. That with the CGI illustrates how much detail James Cameron puts into the movie.Overall, there is plot and it is good, but it is the same as the first movie. Still worth it."
"What a beautiful movie! James Cameron did it again and despite the three plus hour movie, I was craving for more.It's never easy to make a sequel, yet the story evolves in such a creative way. There are obvious parallelisms with the destruction of our planet, and many fine messages of the importance of the family bond, the human greed and the total loss of moral compass which again are delivered subtly and in harmony with the impressive visual spectacle James and his teams have created.It is great to see that people went to see this movie in masses, supporting creators like James Cameron in continuing doing great cinema."
"We enjoyed this movie as much as the first one. My son sitting next to me when a part of the movie had a character suffer from Epilepsy which he was quick to say, she has it just like me. That part touched our family as we all struggled with this illness.I would recommend, good story line, engaging, and magical. Still some questions that need to be answered, but I am sure we will see that in the next line of movies.Beautiful new lands, very creative. New creatures, new characters bring this story to life. Can't await to see the 3rd movie. A movie that is well worth the theater dollars and a must to see on the big screen."
"Honest review. I loved the first movie, and didn't really mind the unoriginal story in it. The second movie however, I feel that the story is so bland, cliche and predictable, that it takes away from some of the visuals. Sure, everyone MUST see this movie in IMAX 3D, it's absolutely breathtaking and is perfection on the SFX and visuals, but for thirteen years we waited for this movie and the story couldn't have been written just a little better? Then again, let's be real, we all go and watch Avatar for the visuals and not the plot regardless, but I do think this one takes away from the special effects. I just wanted the characters to shut up and actually get back in the water so many occasions, but overall, it's definitely worth the watch for what James Cameron accomplishes in the water."
I had great expectations as the Avatar 1 was a great movie and it paved way for the new 3D viewing experience. Fast forward after 13 years this new Avatar 2 released and I had a great hope that it would be better.But this movie has the same story as Avatar 1 except that it is shot in water. My god the first and second act was okish but I couldn't sit in the third act. The movie is way too long and the third act is completely filled with fight scenes that you don't care who wins at the end as it will test your patience.Technically the movie is sound but it could have been trimmed half hour.
"This is a masterpiece and it symbolizes hard work and dedication. The craftsmanship and artistry is in full display. Watching it in Imax was mind blowing, feels like I'm under the water and near to nature, it's just a sensational experience.Very happy that this film came out during my generation. Can't wait to watch this with my children when they growup.A movie with a heart and principle even with the protagonist, their ego and principles in life drives them to do unethical things in life.This is a family movie, that teaches bond and core values, the message of this movie should be heard throughout different generations."
"A true masterpiece! A work of art! Cinematography of high quality!If you're looking for a 3 hours of special effects, which include exotic environments, spectacular alien nature, fantastic fictional areas and of course, as the title suggests, new aquatic environments, then this is the movie for you!Also, if you were looking forward to seeing the story going on from where the first movie left us, then again you will be satisfied.If however, you're looking for a new story with something different from the first movie, then you will be slightly disappointed. I found it quite shallow. Once again, bad human race invade peaceful natives who live as one with their environment, while us humans only looking for exploiting the resources of the planet. I expected rather a different story.However, I still put a 10 because this is a true eye pleasure, especially for those who wonder and fantasize exotic alien planets, their fauna and.flora. This movie did a really good work in depicting in detail both land plants and creatures and underwater sea plants and sea animals!Overal, it was worth it paying extra money to enjoy the 3D screening!Go watch the movie and enjoy it! Hilghly suggested!"
"Family of 6 went to this in the cinema. Loved the 3D, loved the visuals, loved the movie. Thus is every bit as good as the first movie, and is a great continuation of the story. The characters are well developed and once you get to the water scene it is completely breathtaking. The 3hrs went by really fast. Looking forward to the next instalment already. I really cannot understand those people putting this movie down. The plot was great, the storyline great, effects great, 3d great, visual effects great. If anything it may have been a bit long but the time in the cinema flew by. Even if my wife was snoring for half of it. Bring on the next instalment."
"The plot of this movie feels like it was written on the spot, as they went, because I just do not see any cohesion between main ideas. After 13 years, it feels like they simply tried to do too much (badly), rather than a little bit (really well).Firstly, I was so disappointed when they brought back angry Sargent man. He worked in the first movie, but he is so one-dimensional that I just don't care about him and low-key despised having to watch him for another 3 hours.I felt like characters, especially Zoe Saldana's, were completely flattened and there were just too many competing narratives (climate change? Revenge? Whale hunting?)."
"This is typical Cameron ... giant, impressive visuals with a mediocre story. Having said that, I liked the film. I felt the characters could have been fleshed out more as we seemed to dwell a lot on the trouble the teenagers always seemed to be getting into.The Maori influence was painfully obvious: from the tattoos to the sticking out of tongues. I was actually waiting on the reef dwellers to perform a Haka before battling the sky people.The whole ""Evil white people displacing the natives to get the land resources"" schtick is becoming quite tiresome with this franchise but I chose to ignore it and just appreciate the cinematography.The film is quite long, coming in at 3:12 which is approaching the limit of my interest. I'm not sure why Cameron chooses to try to make epics ... this isn't Ben Hur, after all.I did laugh out loud at the obvious Lion King reference, as well as the Aliens and Titanic references. I half expected the two characters to climb onto floating debris and profess their love for each other when the ship sank. Even the music during this sequence echoed Titanic ... and Horner has been dead for 7 years.In conclusion, this movie is really nothing new. Though the visuals are great, the story has been rehashed over and over again through the ages. However, it does provide a few hours of escapism from the real world .. which is why we go to the movies in the first place, isn't it?"
"Despite the length of the movie, James Cameron knew exactly how to keep his audience hooked.What fascinated me the most about this sequel was the introduction of the Metkayina clan which helped to keep things more fresh and interesting. The way.they interact with the sea and the Tulkuns who turn out to be extremely intelligent marine mammals, which I find awesome.Sully and Neytiri's children were great, and I was expecting a romance to develop further between Loa'ak and Tsireya which was a bit disappointing but hey! I am sure it's gonna happen in the next upcoming avatar anyway. I am also looking forwards to learning more about the past of Dr Grace's daughter."
"It's been 12 years waiting to watch the sequel hoping to get more CGI overdoses immersed into the pandora but I am disappointed 😭 Jake Sully proves that marriage is biggest fault in ones life 🤣 he is screwed now with his annoying kids fooling and bullying around . Jake is no more a fierce warrior now but a father who has to face his wife's fury while safeguarding his kids. There is so much of water in the film feel like you are watching an jumbo aquarium on a beach side. Aqua tribe with flat tails and Olympic swimmers skills try to fascinate us as much as possible. Creatures in this sequel from water world ,worth watching them but it was like watching Pandora's Nat Geo channel. James Cameron tries to blend the movie with his own Titanic, Abyss . 3.15 hours of this movie doesn't beat the prequel due it's slow pace and lazy aqua creature watching scenes."
Over all movie is great but director Exhaustions the story 2 hour and last one hour is very enjoyable. Director should build the story first one hour the give the movie some hips. Director explain the story 2 hour because movie visuals was best the i feel good otherwise midle hour movie is very bored.based hero of movie left his own village but his enemy should attack on his village but again i would say Director of movie just waist the time on somewhere in the sea because he wanted to show your his skill in the sea.our UK ticket price is very high but movie not much entertaining the ticket pr.
"The first Avatar is my favourite movie of all time so I was nervous to watch the second movie incase it didn't meet my expectations. Safe to say it exceeded all my expectations. I have seen it twice in the cinema already and I will be going back a third time. Never in my life have I went back to watch a movie within days of seeing it especially one that is over 3 hours long. I usually have a short attention span when it comes to movies but 3 hours felt like 30 minutes. The visuals, the characters, the plot I couldn't fault a thing. I was hooked the entire time even after knowing exactly what was going to happen when I came back the second time. James Cameron is a legend."
"I loved the movie... specially the second half because the first one is a bit boring. Getting us in context for more than an hour felt so long...Visuals are great, I laughed, I cried, I was on the edge of my seat several times...I loved the story, i love the relationship between Na'Vi's and the animals. But I have to say that seeing the production using captive dolphins for the premiere in Japan (the place where the biggest masacre of dolphins takes place) makes me think JC is not really trying to making a statement about respecting our planet but totally into profits... and that, I think, completely rippes apart the whole movie."
"The avatar movies are the greatest cinematographic achievements ever. After the first Avatar movie became the greatest box office success in history, telling a tale like no other and with a production that outclasses anything else, expectations were high for the way of water.After a 13-year-long wait, the movie did not just reach its expectations, but also surpassed them. There is simply nothing in cinematography that even remotely compares to Avatar and no grade other than 10/10 can be justified.Way of the water has it all: breath-taking visuals, a captivating story, excellent acting, fantasy, love and tragedy. An emotional rollercoaster and a cinematic experience unlike any other.All I can say is that each of these movies are a gift and it is a privilege to be alive to watch them. Stories are the core and essence of humankind, and we seldom get stories like this one. If you haven't seen it, don't wait, you're in for a treat."
"James Cameron is such a legend! Thankful for the filmmakers like James Cameron, Steven Spielberg, Christopher Nolan, Quentin Tarantino, Guillermo del Toro, Alejandro González Iñárritu, and Martin Scorsese. They realize the importance of creating art that you can only truly appreciate in the movie theater.This film is exactly why we love going to the movies. You are immediately drawn into the world of Avatar with the stunning cinematography. What made it better was the acting. Though there is CGI, the actor still has to emote the right intensity and feelings to capture a connection with the audience. The work that the actors did underwater was beautiful too. I know that they had to get special training for like a year to be able to free dive and act from 30 ft. Below. They all looked at ease and as if they were at home underwater.I loved that Kate Winslet was in this film.....plus the subtle nod to Titantic at the end. There were a few moments in the middle of the movie where it seemed that maybe it could have been cut out or down, but because it has been announced that there will be at least 2 more films, I believe this film was laying the foundation for those to come. You also have to remember that it has been over a decade since the release of the first movie. It's like we have to be reintroduced in a way.Overall, just like the first film, I walked away wanting to show more respect to our planet. The family dynamic was also very refreshing to see! I'm excited to see how they expand the storyline!!"
"The visuals are good, not great. For a movie released in 2022 you would expect everything to be crisp, sometimes the movie with stutter and sometimes not, but in the end the visuals are the highpoint of it. Storywise, it is a big dissapointment, lack of imagination when it comes to continuing the story, some story elements are left hanging in the air. Earth suddenly had the technogy to clone people directly into avatars. Jake and family leave tree clan so they don't kill them so they can kill the people of the water clan. After killing their people and bringing war to the water clan they are suddenly part of the water tribe. And the ending in my opinion is just there to make way for part 3. I don't really know why you would go to see avatar 3 because it will probably be the same story just with a different tribe."
"I never really found most of these kind of movies good, but man this movie was amazing. Made me cry 3 times, watched it the second time and cried again. I'm not an emotional person, and the fact that this movie made me cry was amazing. The build up of the movie was very good and professional. You should watch it and let me know if you agree. Some of the scenes I didn't really understand, but the graphics were amazingly put together. The ending was very good, I heard others saying it wasn't but not true. Waited a decade for this movie, but it was entirely worth to watch. The plot was amazing and was well connected to the first avatar. However, I do think the acting was kinda trash. The kid was annoying asf. I think they spent too much money on the graphics and couldn't afford good actors for the humans in the movie. 8.5\10."
Don't listen to all of the snobby critics this movie is a true spectacle the world that James Cameron has created is so full of life and it just seems so real. The way that there is hundreds of creatures with unique designs and how the people have culture and religion he truly has created a masterpieceNow onto the story I thought it was fantastic definetly better than the first and I thought that the colonel was an amazing bad guy.The first just felt like a generic action film with not much going on but this one feels a lot more heartfelt and emotional and it really makes you want the good guys to succeedGo see this movie in imax it just looks FANTASTIC so much effort and Attention to detail was put into every scene10/10.
"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.AndI have no other words to define this movieIt's an amazing experience in 4d
An unexpected end and VFX CGI wow
How can I say thank you to James Cameron sir..Thank you sir for giving us this experience."
"The visuals are extremely stunning, and very immersive. The 3 hours runtime came and go. Literally an other-worldly experience. To continue develop on an outstanding first movie is no easy feat, and I think this movie was equally good. Definitely the biggest difference was the visuals, as well as more character development for Jake, Neytiri and Quaritch.However, I felt that the main characters of Jake and Neytiri had plot armor becasue it doesn't feel like they were ever in danger, unlike the first one. The story was good up until the final act where the Metkayina were nowhere to be found. Netayam character felt under-developed too, but his death and funeral scene was emotional. To think that the script was developed more than 3 years, they could've been done better.Overall, the character relationships were very the most interesting, with Kiri and Eywa, Loak and Tsireya, Spider and Quaritch, as well as on the whole family dynamic relationship. Can't wait for the sequels!9/10."
"Alright so I had my first viewing today, in iMax 3D at the best cinema in my country. I also rewatched the original Avatar two days ago in preparation for this viewing.I absolutely loved it. This was 1000% my greatest cinema experience to date, the quality of the visuals were just out of this world. I've never seen anything like it before, this movie is most likely the best looking movie of all time. Truly outstanding visuals.As for the rest, while the story was quite simple I liked it. I liked having Quaritch back in the fold, it felt more meaningful to have him as the antagonist once again rather than a completely new face. We'll get that in later Avatar movies anyways, it can wait for now. I also loved the moment where Neytiri forced him to reveal his parental feelings for Spider.I'll however admit that I wished this movie would have had Jake and Neytiri's love for each other be as central as in the original, but I understand why it wasn't that way. The main focus this time around was family instead, which was great. I only felt this way since I loved their love story in the original so much.I also of course have to mention the death scene of Neteyam...That was truly sad, and a very well done scene. I shed some tears during it and during his funeral + the throwbacks at the end of the movie as well.Then there was our main protagonist Jake, who we saw this different side of for the entire movie this time. Now a proud father and all mature, it was great to see his evolution. I'm looking forward to seeing how he'll be in the next one.Then we had the the big focus on water, the sea and nature overall, which I loved. It felt spiritual, and allowed for loads of truly visually outstanding underwater scenes. Sometimes, it even felt like I was there under the water due to the iMax 3D.Overall it was a truly fantastic movie, just as I expected it to be. James Cameron is a genius after all. 👑I'm giving Avatar: The Way of Water a 10/10."
"With all that money, how can the story and dialogue be so bad? Sadly, even with all the stunning visuals, I found myself getting bored and restless. I was relieved when it was finally over. There was just no compelling story and characters to pull me in and get into. It reminded me more of a glorified saturday morning cartoon than a blockbuster movie, but with better graphics. I liked the anti-colonial, environmental theme, but then they went and pushed the patriarchal nuclear family ad nauseam, which was irritating. I found myself pondering why they couldn't do better with the story telling when they had all the resources at their disposal? My guess is that they spent so much money on production that they were risk averse and fell back to following some tired holywood formula. Well, it seems to have worked, because it appears the film is looking to be a big financial success."
"""Avatar: The way of Water"" is a beautiful movie and probably the best I have seen this year.Since the first Avatar had such a great ending, I was afraid of this sequel. However, the movie is much better than I expected and just as good as the first.Maybe, the best part about this movie is that it is not trapped in a specific label. The movie is fiction, but it has romance, beautiful relationships between family and friends, it has action scenes (really good ones), and heartbreaking moments.The new characters are interesting and relevant to the plot, and I loved to see another culture and environment among the Na'vi, and how the tribes are different even though they are the same species. Basically, the movie is beautiful visually and emotionally."
"The original Avatar set the bar high for anything that has come after it. Avatar II had a lot to live up to before it was ever even conceived. That said, James Cameron and all of the thousands of dedicated hard working people who worked together to make 'this' happen, out did themselves. Not in the sense of Avatar II being better than the first, but in moving the story forward in ways that keep the original Avatar audience and newcomers involved. We saw this in 3D. Please do yourself a favor and pay the extra money to do so as well. Every scene, every movement, every second is beautifully breathtaking. I am as impressed with the quality of every shot as I am with the progression and growth of our beloved characters. Job well done. We are going 3D again on Friday."
"The movie 3D effects could have been nicely done particularly the under water scenes. However, the 3d effects were below standard and ending was weak. Ronal and. Tonowari left their family members just for the main characters Jake and his family members to save the day ? The water people went home at the middle of the fight and did not bother saving their own daughte Tsireya ?The plot of the movie was weak and I expected much better from James Cameron after a long wait since the Avatar first movie was released.The only notable things are the VFX of the movie and the action scenes were good."
"I watched Avatar: The Way of Water with my wife at the cinema and we both really enjoyed the film.The story moves along nicely and whilst this is a 3hr film it never once dragged and it was always engaging. Given that the characters are CGI rather than people I was surprised how emotional both myself and my wife found ourselves feeling albeit at different points in the film.It's definitely a film that will be enjoyed the most on the big screen. Hats off to James Cameron, he's delivered again. If you enjoyed the 1st instalment you'll enjoy this sequel. I'm certainly looking forward to the third film when it's released. Great Entertainment."
"I really enjoyed this movie. I felt as though it was a great step up from the previous one and does a lot to expand on the exotic alien planet of Pandora, by showing us more of the world, different ways of life, its' people, and all with stunning shots, effects and locations. It was a smart move for the film to take us to completely uncharted waters by being set by the beaches as opposed to the dense jungle forests of the first film.Like with the first film, I was quite immersed to the point where I didn't realize whether or not 3 hours passed, as a part of me did want more. The words I would use to describe the film and my experience, were epic, awesome and cool. Some of the story beats are very similar to the first movie however, such as learning the ways of life on Pandora and failing comedically first but then nailing it later, our character gets attacked and cornered by a carnivorous threat of the wilds due to their inexperience (and losing their weapon by the beast ripping it from their hands with its jaw and throwing it away off to the side :/), ""bonding"" with an Irkan (Banshee) scene, war between the Na'vi and RDA (whatever that stands for because no one has ever actually told us), even (what sounds like) usage of the previous films soundtrack (in similar scene), and the same villain as before (but in a new context). However, this does not mean it isn't worth a watch, because what helps change things, is the relationship between Jake Sully, Neytiri, and their family, as we see the pair now have to take on parental roles to their teenage (I'm guessing) kids, Jake more so. This greatly helps in adding stakes to the film, as well as helping it not feel entirely like a rehash of the previous film. The characters were all fun and serviceable to the plot, no problems there in my opinion and the acting was solid throughout.Some things did come out of nowhere, such as the brain copying capabilities of the RDA (or Weyland Yutani for all we know :/), Col. Guaritch having a son (with who?) that was living in the RDA Facilities seemingly during the events of the first film, as well as Grace having supposedly been pregnant, and that child still being alive by the beginning of the new movie (I'm guessing), as well as her abilities and ties to Eywa and the powers it grants her. But these did not take away from the film but added to it by expanding on characters, and the world, in a way that was never distracting or grating in my opinion. As well, it feels like some scenes were missing in certain moments, as the story simply cut to things without any establishing of what had happened before that part. One thing I wish could've been expanded on was Spiders' feelings towards Neytiri threatening to kill him, as I don't recall her apologizing to him, or a scene showing how he feels about having been used and threatened like that against someone who he may as well consider a kind of mother figure to him.Once again it wasn't a deal breaker, but made me wonder: ""If the film is 3 hours long, then could we not have used (some of) that time to establish some things?"" There was a particular scene involving Lo'ak (one of Jakes' kids) simply swimming again and again with the Tulkun that could've been shortened or cut entirely (but it's fine cause the visuals were beautiful ;) ). This is also not to say that any scenes feel unnecessary, dragged out, or too long, as everything served a purpose. The films pacing was alright, but I did sort of wonder where the movie was going around the time Jake and his family arrived at Metkayina, and when we would be watching Guaritch and his Na'vi demon Jarhead Shitoon learning to ""bond"" with an Irkan. I wondered this because, whilst one could definitely see that the film will repeat the same Technology vs Nature trope again, I was thinking it could have gone some other direction, but where it went was fine, but I expect something else from Avatar 3: A dream of Spring.The story was fine and passable (obviously the white savior trope will always mostly suck), but what I really like is how accessible it is, as anyone could watch the movie and understand it with no real problem (not to say the first one was confusing). But what really stood out for me, was how the film had various scenes shot in 48 frames per second. It made the film look a bit video gamey at times, in a good way. This really lent the movie a sense of otherworldliness, because I personally haven't seen many (if any) films do that. The best part was that it was not used in excess, as high action moments and scenes like the banshee flying, were presented in said framerate, and those moments looked amazing and stunning for it.And finally, enough can't be said about the visuals. Oh. My. God. The world of Pandora (especially at night) is quite the spectacle to behold, even more so on the silver screen (in IMAX). It's this amazing mixture of cinematography, framing, the world itself and the coloring of all scenes that makes the overall film truly appealing to the eye, even that's underselling it (sidenote though: I will always dislike it when the camera randomly zooms in on some shots. I disliked it in the first film, and was upset to see it return, but not a dealbreaker at all, just a nitpick). Explaining it here cannot do it justice, so my recommendation is to go out and watch it to helps James Cameron make $3 Billion this time! Ha ha! I know I will be doing so again honestly.Also, there is a cameo from the Weekend ;)"
"Just got back from the theater. It was the most amazingly beautiful movie I've ever seen. I actually teared up/cried multiple times during the movie. It was definitely looong but awesome! I'm a father now, so I loved the family aspect of the movie. It was all about family. I was gobsmacked at how real this movie looked. I loved the original Avatar back in 2009, and I saw it 6 times in theaters! If I could I would see The Way of Water 10 times! There were multiple moments in the movie where my mouth was just hanging open because I couldn't believe what I was witnessing. If you can see it in 3D that is the absolute best way to see this masterpiece of a film."
"This movie definitely was a winner to me. The storyline line was very clear an easy to understand. Well done James Cameron, Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana and all the others. In 3D it was Spectacular. No kidding it was amazing. Great movie, up there with my favourites. Definitely go see it you will not be disappointed. Absolutely spectacular filming and the sea live were so cool and realistic. I love how they brought back Colonel in Avatar form, So cool. Worth the watch and 3 hours of sitting on a seat. Go watch it you will not be disappointed at all, Trust me. It is very impressive. WELL DONE!!!"
"The defining characteristic of the first Avatar (and most of Cameron's films) is a simple story told well - less story characters equals more time to focus on each character (and make you care for them).Avatar 2 is a character overload. Sully's extended family of 4 kids (+1 on the side) means an awful lot of moving parts in the script. The kids bloat the noticeable runtime with subplots, distracting from the otherwise simple (and powerful) core emotional principle of 'look how pretty/pure this world is that we have to save!'I assume the kids exist because the Avatar series needs them established now for use in future movie installments. But this movie suffers significantly because of it - by the third act the kids feel along for the ride, with a couple feeling actively in the way of resolving the plot ('What the hell *do* you do with kids number 3 & 5 during this action sequence?')If you ignore the 'characters exist for future films' theory then 2 Sully kids (and at least 1 non-Sully kid) could be immediately removed without any plot ramifications. A third Sully kid could be removed (with a somewhat shoe-horned evil-free-willy subplot) and immediately free up 30+ minutes of screen time to properly develop the interactions/motivations of the remaining characters. Then, when important things happen in the third act, we might just be emotionally engaged enough with the remaining characters to care.Please, oh please, somebody think about the children."
"The movie is a continuation of the story from first film. I don't want to reveal much here so I am going to jump straight to my review.The movie has a story that binds you with the screen. The villain is a ghost from the past but he is as much of a na'vi now as our dear Jack Sulli and girlfriend.The visual effects of the movie are beyond anything I have seen so far. It shows the work of 13 years on the movie and its appearance on the big screen.This movie is going to be the foundation for the next in the series so it ends with a lot of ""What Next"" in it.Overall, it is a great movie and everyone should see it for the creativity that has been used to build such a masterpiece."
"This movie needs some serious editing. There was a lot going on, many subplots, just too much. My brain needed a break. A lot of characters and I couldn't tell who was who except for the phenomenal Kate Winslet. I was super confused at the one year later part. And why did master chief risk all that stuff, all those lives for the one guy? I don't know. It was partly a remake of the first one, partly commentary on us destroying our beautiful Earth (which we so are) and a whole lot of unnecessary extra. And yet not enough time devoted to any the many story lines. They have three more of these movies coming, please streamline them and make them good. I will not be able to sit through three hours of this three more times. Hello."
+ I only give it a 3/10 for it's fantastic look.If you care about logic in a film like me then you will absolutely hate this movie. In the end of the movie they acually made it a final boss fight between only the protagonists and antagonists completely ignoring that there were about 300 random Avatar soldiers at the beginning of the fight and after the fight again. Also I think you saw hundreds of technological advanced humans die while you only saw one tribesman avatar die.The plot armor is extreme. Even for the main antagonist.Only one protagonist had no plot armor in the end which was obviously only to make people sad about his death. I couldn't have cared less tough.The movie is 100% black and white like in a disney movie to make sure you know who are the good guys and who are the bad guys.The movie shoves down your throat the importance of family. It is so overused it is actually way worse than in Fast & Furious. Family!!!A lot of unimportant scenes which contribute nothing to the story.It is way too long. Even for people who liked the movie.
"You can say what you want, but James Cameron can make wonderful worlds. The world created in. Pandora is dangerous but so symbiotic, I would love to live in it. We the humans are what we are, destructive, in search of wealth and no care for all the damage we cause.From the beginning, you pick the side of the Na'vi.The visual is just stunning, we saw the movie in 3D and Laser Ultra and from the first second till the last we were mesmerized. The pause in the middle felt like you were ripped off the womb because you wanted to stay in that world for as long as possible.Some say that the story isn't that great, well me as a parent i don't agree. I had a thrill of emotions, and I could identify myself with the struggles of Jake.If there's a movie you need to see this decade on the big screen, this is the one to pick.Lay down in your seat and enjoy. Engage!We're ready for number 3."
"For all the bad to low reviews clearly can not define the story in this amazing cinematic masterpiece . Its beauty is outstanding, graphics, story and scenes.Trust me on this, watch it once your enjoy, watch it twice your for in love.The characters of the family are truly enjoyable, beautiful in places and full of enjoyment.Do watch and don't compare, think of it as a new film with history.You can see where the next three will develop and grow.Weaver is amazing and how she pulled playing a young character is incredible.Cracking film with everything. Go watch and enjoy. Will take an amazing film to beat it this year."
"The visuals of Avatar 2 were amazing, breathtaking you might say. But the movie was messy when it came to the story. Many other reviews discuss the storyline further.Something I noticed: Why do Jake and Neytiri's kids all have 5 fingers? Isn't Jakes avatar 50% human and 50% real na'vi? So if he and Neytiri have kids (a real na'vi) wouldn't there be a chance for the kids to also have 4 fingers?I'm sure the 5 fingers made up to see the difference from the avatars and the na'vi and to see who's a halfblood or not. But wouldn't it be more realistic if a child from Jake had one hand with 5 fingers and one hand with 4?Watching Avatar: the way of water in 3D with High Frame Rate was so fun. But if you want to see a really good movie story wise? Then Avatar 2 is not the best choice to watch."
"I'm not sure what people are exactly looking for in a story, but I found that it was a breath of fresh air (no pun intended). There was a lot to be desired but I felt that was on purpose considering there are plans for more movies. The main things that are breath taking in this movie are 1) effects and 2) world building. There is a lot of world building in this that does sometimes take away from the story at hand and the story is pushed along a bit faster because of how much time is spent looking at effects and world building. The story in my opinion is nothing to be hated, but nothing to be adored either. I'm not sure what everyone is looking for but if you're looking for a break from all the Marvel, Star Wars Disney B. S then this is a great film to escape with. Honestly it checked most of my boxes for a good movie. Everyone else who said it was bad, I'm honestly curious what you say a good film is. I feel some of the reviews here are pretty harsh concerning the story and characters."
"As a highly movie critic, this is by far the best movie this year. I usually do research before watching a movie because I hate the idea of wasting time and this movie really didn't make me feel like I waisted my time. It makes you really appreciate nature and God's wonderful creation. For those like me that usually do a lot of research before watching a movie then let me save you time, go watch it. You won't regret it.What I didn't like: The story is kinda slow, you have to be patient because it helps you build a stronger connection with the actors.Finally, I recommend watching it in imax 3D or 3D in general. I'm probably going to do so my second time around as I didn't do it this first time."
"I've loved Avatar ever since I was a little girl, and must've watched it over 30 times. So it's safe to say that, for me, long cuts of just the characters exploring the beautiful world (with the fantastic job the CGI team did) is no problem at all.Furthermore, the characters from the first film are written perfectly in this new environment and I really enjoyed seeing how their lives had changed over the last 13 years.It's a slow paced film, a work of art that focuses on exploring the world and characters in detail, no rush. That's not to say there's no action, because there is, and some really good fight sequences too that had me holding my breath.On the whole, I absolutely loved this movie. It's similar to the original yes, but it's also new and exciting and emotional and so so beautiful. I think you just have to believe the pretext of the film, not get too nitpicky with plot details and just enjoy the ride. Of course it has faults, and the story is not the strongest, but as I said, if you are a fan of the first one, you need to watch this one. It was truly a magical experience to get absorbed into this story, one I didn't want it to end. Also, do go see the 3D version if you can, it's really well done and it's Avatar, I mean, come on.On the other hand, if you expect that every interaction will further the plot (it's slow paced, but it's not one of those films that feels like they drag on forever, the rhythm is really nice), dislike the sequences where the director explores the world, dismiss the Na'avi just because they are blue and are constantly complaining about long films, then don't even bother watching it and leaving a bad review for a film that's clearly not suited to your tastes."
"I was completely taken with the visuals and the story of the animals, the world, and the creatures of this movie. That was by far my favourite part. The realism of the graphics that they created is phenomenal. There was no semblance of fakeness, it all seemed completely real.Now the reason I am not giving this a ten is the infuriating writing and plot. They literally bring the same bad guy back, but in avatar form, and on his first mission he happens to bump into the children of his enemy. The US military apparently abandons all strategic thinking in order to seek revenge on one man. The family moves to another tribe in order to put the tribe they will with out of danger, instead putting their new tribe into danger. Then after a bit of grief and conflict they resolve to ""not run"" anymore. You would think that means going back to their original tribe? Nope it means staying with the tribe they have only been with for like two weeks. The final battle must also be mentioned. Why did the entire tribe disappear at the end of it? So that they could have a better finale epic fight scene that's why. Does not matter that it makes no sense.Anyways, the beauty of the underwater scenes, the magic of Pandor, the connectivity with nature, and the way the humans decimating the land with their machinery bring this to a 9 for me. Totally enjoyable. Seeing it in 3DX was really quite great as well."
"The graphics were an 8 but the plot and its arcs are a 4. So many cliches . The revenge arc, the teenage boy arc, the poor wounded outcast animal become friend arc, and many unexplained things. Like, how did the Sigourney Weaver character get her special powers? Where did Jakes communication devices come from? How do the characters acclimate to the water so easily? No answers but lots of holes . And, the ending was an obvious lead up to another sequel.Was daunted initially by the three hour run time, but it went very quickly. Might actually have to see this in 3D in a few weeks to get the full effect."
"The visual was nothing but wonderful and the story really could've been better, not that it was bad but it was a simple story (and cameron does this magic that even the average stories make me amazed)
It's a good movie with a pretty message about family and differences, also if you usually cry in movies, prepare yourself!!3 hours and 12 minutes that went past flying, at least for me that usually gets bored when the movie is too long or nothing happens for a while.All the characters are likable (spiiiiderrr) and you get attached. There's also a really good balance between suspense, comedy... and jump scaresI noticed some things that where left kind of open in the story but it's probably so he can make a sequel."
"Have you seen the first movie? Did you like it? If yes you will like this one. But don't expect to be overwhelmed. You will definitely keep awake for 3 hours( movie duration), you will appreciate the genius of CGI, new worlds and enhanced navi water ecosystems, advanced script writing and storytelling with attention to details but the storyline is just a continuum or a remake of the first one. A 2.0 fight between Jack Sully and the Invaders from planet earth. This is where I believe there is room for improvement.Definitely James Cameroun spent a decade imagining the sequel content, script, cinematic, decors, characters, a new environnement and it did paid off. He could have spent more of this time imagining maybe a different story line, like what Disney did successfully with Star Wars Saga. The return on investment would have been much much higher."
"I mainly we to the movies because the last one was good
It's a 3 + hour movie and the scenes move really slow I thought that it would be interesting like the last one but it turned out to be really bad I asked some people around they told me the same so I asked my smaller cousins if they liked it they told me it was boring this movie got a lot of hype I really don't recommend going it's a waste of money and time. They say it's action but the action part of the movie was the last bit which was not enough since it's a 3+ hour movie
If you want to take my opinion I would really recommend you not going even if your friends told you it's a waste of time and Money."
"Wow. What a ride. I was agreeably surprised by the movie. I went in there with low expectations. My husband and I watched it in 3D, last night on a cold and rainy new year's eve. I hadn't been much impressed by the first Avatar movie. I must say I was wrong and will rewatch with new eyes.The agent Jake Sully must protect his family from the human soldiers. They take refuge in a far away village of fisher-avatars and must learn a way of living in order to integrate and start over. The story line is ok. Few sub stories give a break on the ongoing forever chasing between the relentless colonel and one desperate Jake who wants to protect his family above everything.I was captivated by the parts where the protagonists learn their way underwater, the discovery of the wonders mother nature offers, the magic interaction with the sea, specially between the kids and the water. The 3D was beautifully done. I could almost feel the water around me.. the movie reminded me of Life of Pi. I felt overwhelmed by emotions so much the movie perfectly conveyed the need for loving and respecting our planet and all its magnificent creatures. I saw the movie as an hymn to nature. The message is stop the savage destruction of our planet, human greed is the cause of our fatality. Open your eyes to our world, listen to the suffering of planet Earth and its mighty creatures. In short, the story itself was second to me. I just felt compelled by the beauty of our planet. What James Cameron tried to say is save our beautiful Earth. Thank you for this magnificent voyage and Happy New Year to everyone on Earth, may it bring you every joy!"
"James Cameron and his amazing team made something here that will hold everyone accountable in Hollywood. The CGI (if you could even call it that) is so amazing that several times I questioned what I was seeing if it was real or not. Truly a master piece and what going to movies is about. The attention to detail is by far above and beyond what anyone could have expected. Marvel and anything like it must be held accountable to this film going forward. After being jaded with poor CGI and people standing in front green screens pretending to be afraid of what's behind or in front of them, this film will keep them accountable."
"In the future, humanity conquered interstellar travel but ended up defeated by arthropod-like beings, mounted on a kind of flying horses and armed with bows and arrows. This is the level of idiocy that Cameron's story hopes we will, shall we say, ""normalize"", and by the way, the excuse that this is a children's film is particularly insulting, because even a child has to know that this is silly and meaningless. For the rest, what is Avatar 2 about? Cameron bets on the lowest common denominator of man, the male, the father of the family, invested in his basic need to defend his family against the demonic personification of the ""sky people"", the projection that Cameron makes of the capitalist sect to which he wants to reduce the human species, a headless crowd of people, with a lexicon reduced to phrases like ""let's go get some bucks"" while happily torturing a species of alien whales, since in this film, human beings are generally very bad and very, but very dumb, besides of course having an aim at the level of a short-sighted 74 year old; and in this reduction of human invaders to apes thirsting for easy profit Cameron imports all possible and imaginary clichés, and so there is the rebellious young man, the mother thirsty for revenge (and surprisingly xenophobic) and the bad guy, very bad and looking like a bad guy. Avatar 2, in addition to being a 3-hour-long nonsense of mental emptiness that will torture any IQ above 70 to the verge of despair, is above all a dangerous film: the unidimensionality of the characters, the superficiality of their motivations, revenge, profit, despite, and the ultra-simplification he makes of the theme of colonization, absent of values, without moralism or any kind of inherent intellectuality, goes hand in hand with a surprising and shocking inhumanity; in this film, mostly humans die and are slaughtered (I counted a casualty among the Na'vis), and all that was missing was the applause of the audience at the moment when the blue arthropod alien sticks his prehistoric weapon in the dark soul human being, he, the Avatar symbolic of our own decadence. A bad film, a 2 billion dollar disaster, very difficult to justify if not for its technical brilliance, but which even there does nothing more than repeat the hyper-saturated look of color worthy of the most basic cartoon imaginable. Idiot, uninteresting and expendable. Save your money."
"Straight to cinema screens,after a long break of 13 years we are going to Pandora. IF you have not seen the first part,then the story of the movie is being continued,and film itself shows quite a lot of historical elements. The first part sets a very high bar for video effects and quality,the sequel is much ahead of it with highly detailed images and action scenes,the breath of story and the stories around of the planet itself. The most worth watching in cinema theaters,even though the movie is very very long (3h 12m),but i didn't get bored. It's similar to the first part according to the narration,but from the midle of movie everything just increases. I couldn't count the number of sceensavers of my fingers,so the movie absolutely surpasses everything i've seen on cinema screen this year.I won't reveal details,becouse it's worth seeing for yourself and movie presents at least 4 different stories in future,that will be very deeply connected.James keep the bar very high for himself,so i hope and wait not only for 3rd film but also for more stories."
"It took about 13 years to have a sequel, over time since the first film technology has changed a lot, and avatar has accompanied this change standing together, we saw it in the beautiful and amazing visual effects, most notably in the night scenes (due to several eclipses), it is noted that unlike many companies avatar did not skimp on cgi in these scenes - the concern for achieving perfection is noticeable.The story continues Jake's journey in protecting his family and continuing his relationship with princess Na'vi of the Omaticaya clan and follows this path extending to secondary stories - to the couple's children, going deeper into some...
Very well produced story, and a decent sequel to the first film in the trilogy.Definitely a masterpiece! Strong Oscar candidate, and if it wins it will be more than fair, it deserves a lot."
"Fr we had to wait for about 13 years for the sequel! A MUST WATCH! AND THE VISUALS NEVER FAILS TO DISAPPOINT! AND THE SOUNDTRACK ALONE MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE LITERALLY LIVING IN PANDORA! 💙 James Cameron has really out done himself AGAIN! It's really a moving story that is perfectly put together about love, family, fatherhood. 💙 THE ENDING WILL LEAVE YOU WANTING FOR MORE EVEN THOUGH IT'S A THREE HOUR LONG MOVIE. Literally one of the best sequel ever made.*overall rating*
100/10literally been looking forward to the movie since the first avatar came out, and was not disappointed. IT'S A SERVE HUNTY! 💙"
"Let's get this out of the way: Avatar 1 was never meant to be a movie about story, it was made purely to show off what CGI can do when pushed to its limits. The story was basic but good enough for what the movie was.This movie stays faithful to the first and goes the same route: focusing less on story and more on making everything look cool, and it does that really well. The CGI in this movie is so great that it looks completely real. Pandora is still magical. While the story here is nothing oscar-worthy, it is good, even if it does have problems. This movie fulfilled its purpose and expanded the world of avatar in a way that doesn't do anything to hurt the original."
"I never review movies even if I like them but after that experience I feel so compelled to say something and to show my appreciation for what James Cameron and everyone involved has created.The stunning visuals, the creativity, the innocence, the love, the power, the raw nature of this movie was immaculate.Before watching I was slightly in doubt what this movie could add to the first one but it really delivered in its own unique way.Not necessarily the main plot that carried this movie in a sense it was quite similar to the first one but 3 and a half hours there's a lot that goes into it."
"This is kind of watch in theater or not watch at all kind of movie. It's a unparallel experience of cinematography if you are watching this movie in theater. I watched in IMAX 3D and never before I was this much mesmerized by visual effects.But movie falls behind in story line. Story is pretty much predictable and not much engaging and movie literally stops flowing at some point and then recovers again. But would definitely recommend this movie for theater experience.Also as a average viewer, sometimes I got confused between different characters as they look similar sometimes but it was not big issue."
"It is a film lacking a well-thought-out plot, scenes and characters to spare. I give it a 3 just for the work that must have cost to do it.The length is excessive, considering that the plot is extremely basic, messy, with no reason to sustain for 3 hours.Overrated by the effort involved in special effects that deliver an easy, overloaded beauty.It is not even entertaining in a basic way so that it qualifies as a panorama to go to the cinema to see it
In short, a film full of repeated and long scenes, unnecessary dialogues and characters. Full of ""fireworks"" that could justify that there is a massive audience that enjoys it."
"There you are, immersed in the visuals. ""wOw! ITs sO PrEtTy!""
then, you think, ""huh, cool place, i wonder what's going to be its downfall with the villains. Surely it won't be the same humans again from the last movie.""surely the plot won't be a stunningly beautiful... wait...*control c* ..'click'..*control v*..'click'""Maybe my experience was ruined because I started looking for a plot around half and hour in instead of waiting till the 1h 30min mark. And even then it was rather disappointing. My entire experience is summed up with, ""wow that's pretty, cool that's also an amazing visual effect ...Where be the plot?""
would recommend watching cause it looks cool, but I would leave at around an hour forty. Ur just wasting time staying longer."
"Honestly, it could've had no plot or storyline and I would still love this movie because of how visually breathtakingly stunning it is. The world of Pandora James Cameron has created is unlike anything I've ever seen before and in Avatar: TWOW he just expands even farther into this beautiful world he has made for all of us to experience. And let me tell you it truly is an experience, especially after seeing it in 3-D. But this film does have a beautiful storyline. Anything that has to do with the protection of family, and being more connected with nature truly gets me right in the heart, and that's what this film was centered around."
"I have no idea how this movie has 8 stars! You know when a film feels like 8 hours long it's bad and it was indeed a very long and depressing 3 hours. I love fantasy but the story and the way it's told is so poor.I'm not sure about anyone else but I go to the cinema for fun and enjoyment and this whole film is brutal cruelty and injustice without much happiness to make it worthwhile.What is a shame is they have created the amazing world and amazing special effects but then it becomes self indulgent with long spells of underwater scenes that drag.Trying to think of some positives, but I just found the whole experience painful and a disappointment. In hindsight I would have paid double my ticket price not to see it and waste an evening!So disappointing and you would think with all the talented people in the world the industry could do sooo much better."
"I was thinking this would just be another movie set in a fantastical forest - honestly I wouldn't have been disappointed if it was more of the same from number one, but this took it to a whole new level by taking the world underwaterHow they came up with new versions of avatars is beyond me. It was like a documentary, you could just have easily had David Attenborough narrating and I would have though the creatures we were watching truly existed in our world. Even if you don't dig the story, the movie is worth it for that alone!But then they add story, depth, love, culture, nostalgia.....list goes on. It is one of my favourite movies and I will watch it again and again.BETTER THAN THE FIRST!"

"In this long awaited sequel Cameron established Pandora very well than his previous avatar.each & every detailing was perfectly created & every frame looks like a painting , every sequence, every shot is amazing. It's a visual feast, I recommend everyone to watch part 1 before you watch part 2.in the first 1hr:30 minutes you will see mind boggling Pandora world & the story establishment happens for the rest of the sequels & in the later 1hr:30 minutes Cameron takes us to another unexplored world of Pandora which is oceans of Pandora. There's absolute thrill in every frame.story is about collecting something which I won't reveal you will find out anyway while watching, meanwhile Jake sully & his family is haunted by human settlements.how all of these are interconnected and affect our hero & his family in a way is all about way of water."
"We went with the whole extended family - 3 generations ranging from 75 to12 years of age. We took up two rows in the VMax, prepped with snacks, had a toilet break in the last 5min of previews before the movie started and then donned our 3D glasses. The youngest hadn't experienced 3D before and gasped when the opening scene started; reaching out his hand as the images came towards us. Many others in the cinema had the same reaction and there were quite a few ooohs and aaaahhhs. We all 100% loved it!!!! It didn't feel like a 3 hour movie and the middle section of the plot - learning about the way of water - was truly a glorious experience. (I've read that some thought it too long and unnecessary - However I absolutely loved it and it gave an insight into the kids lives) We go to the movies to be entertained and to enjoy a well told story. And James Cameron has definitely done that. I went back on my own to watch it a second time (without the 3D glasses) and picked up a few little things that I must have missed in the first viewing. This wasn't a bad thing - I'm just pointing out that in a cinema full of people of all ages your eyes can be distracted sometimes. I think I enjoyed the second viewing even more. I shouted myself to a Gold Class screening, reclined back and just let the movie wash over me. There's so much to take in that I'm really looking forward to watching it a third time on the small screen at home. Seeing it in VMax on the BIG screen is something you need to experience, however sometimes your eyes can't take in the full scene, so watching it at home in the comfort of your living room or media room is going to be special as well."
"Definitely a 3D cinema movie! Without realising it you just get immersed in everything! My 12-year-old LOVED it! I was worried about the length and getting bored, but it certainly kept my attention, despite being a bit of a thin story and everyone (weirdly) having American accents. Lots of amazing visuals. I did get a bit fed up with the Mr Nasty character and found him a bit ""Rambo' over the top and the plot predictable. Is here really substance for a third film after this one? I am not sure. Still, I enjoyed seeing it, especially in 3D and felt I was able to suspend my own life for over 3 hours, so quite useful!"
"Is it visually appealing? YES! Is it a good movie? Not by a long shot.The movie teases an action packed adventure at the beginning, before lulling you to sleep for the majority of the movie, and then throwing in an action sequence at the very end to tie up loose ends.Definitely not worth the glowing reviews it's been receiving for anything other than visual effects.The bulk of the movie feels as if the producers simply wanted to show off what they could do with CGI, and forgot to put any effort into the storytelling.The amount of open loops that the writers left open, along with the fact that the movie easily could've been about an hour and a half shorter without sacrificing any of the storyline, leaves me scratching my head as to how this movie has been receiving such high reviews."
Avatar is fine thanks so much nissan sentra transmission and the Women of all trips for the night let us know if we have a chance for the rest nissan and we will also be back for a couple weeks for a 6th week but you will be able by picking up from the finest flight around and down your lane to your right corner and the Women are a little more relaxed and relaxed with the girls in a row in bed and breakfast with her final night and the Women in bed and a bed for her final night of driving and the Women who fell out which were a little bit out which was right now as they had to wait a couple weeks to see.
"I thought this movie was fine. This sequel has been in development for a long time. It finally released in December last year and I went to go see it and it was fine. Ok, this movie looks gorgeous, the water scenes and the landscapes look amazing, the character designs are beautiful, it's pretty to look at. But why is it so long? Why 3 hours long. Personally, I think that's way too long, but to each their own. I haven't seen the first movie when I saw the sequel, I saw the sequel on a school field trip soooo...yeah. I think a seven out of ten is good for this movie. It could win some Oscar's, who knows, I'm rooting for GDT's Pinocchio and Everything Everywhere All at once. Do you want this movie to win a Oscar?Anyways...mmarcilovesutoo."
We went and saw movie today. I loved it so much!! Can't wait for the next one. I don't want to put any spoilers. Awesome Awesome Awsome - It was the best movie I've seen since the 1st Avatar.vcddrewschiiuedfbbkouffdxcbjk. Iutrdcbbju ifdsetujhbcv khfderyikn cdsryikkj cfttt ffredd we no more have to wait for that movie to get released in theaters and then wait for the movie to release and wait till the movie comes out in theaters and then go to theaters and watch them all again. Love the movie but the movie will make you cry once or twice. The movie will always be my favorite movie for all time.
"Eman and I spend good time watching this one in the Palestinian Trade Tower 3D cinema. We were literally 5 people in the cinema! Although the ending was sad, we cried a lot, but we learn when the son saves the evil father from drowning that evil and good intersect. I love the ocean. We discussed actually, Eman if we have the choice to live with them we will do, if we have an option to convert to an avatar!""The way of water has no beginning and no end. Our hearts beat in the womb of the world. Water connects all things, life to death, darkness to light. The sea gives and the sea takes.""""The People say all energy is borrowed and someday you have to give it back"""
"Wasn't a fan of the first one, so it took some persuading to see the new one. I was pleasantly surprised. This time around, the story seemed more understandable to me than the first. Breathtakingly beautiful scenes. Interesting creatures. I like the fact that it was exploring more of the world of the Na'vi and hope that future films take us further into Pandora. I want to take a vacation in Pandora! I wish the characters were more different to be easier to tell them apart, but overall a really enjoyable film. Did not feel like a 3 hour movie, it moved so well. Didn't see it in 3D, but am considering doing so."
"While the film is up to the highest standards in its cinematography the story telling is, by far, one of the worst I have expirienced. Characters have little to no depth, they are pure plot devices. Every major event is forseeable and connected by poorly written actions, sparking from ever the same character. On top of that there is no emotion, but an almost violent attempt to force a certain emotion onto you at given plot-points.Given the effort and the names that went into writing the story, this seems almost offensive and as if this movie relies on its impressive visual effects. Which, as mentioned, are convincing. The decision to shoot above 24fps works well when watched in 3D and allows for a very nice expirience. With a run time of over 3 hours however, having to watch this almost repulsive story feels like punishment more than everything else.Personally: a definite waste of money and a clear recommandation to not watch this movie."
"Absolutely stunning. The CGI is incredibly convincing to the point where you don't notice anything looking off. It all looks phenomenal. The lights, fantasy setting with rich colors and life was breathtaking. The storytelling and acting was also very well done overall. The ending where the main villain lets his illegitimate son make him stop his ongoing destruction was a very unconvincing turn that didn't sell to me. There were some elements in the story or script that were a bit cheesy, but not to large extent. Aside from a few moments, the story was strong. Very excited for future Avatar films."
"Avatar: The Way of Water. We just saw it. My two cents is as follows- with a couple of spoilers. It's only my two cents, which we know doesn't hold any water.*
*
*
*""The way of water has no beginning and no end,"" much like this movie. Was this the most visually beautiful movie I've ever seen? Why yes, it is. It is visually stunning and so detailed that it did indeed make me feel immersed in each scene. Absolutely beautiful.This movie is too damn long, as per all James Cameron movies. It could have beeen told in a more concise way in under two hours.The story was very weak. It is so weak that James Cameron had to fill three hours and twelve minutes with extra long segments of hunting, fighting, war, and the obligatory underwater tourism advertisement.The entire idea of implanting the saved consciousness of a human into a created avatar means we're just going to keep having to deal with a character like the already deceased Colonel Miles Quaritch over and over, and over again. By the way, the Colonel had a human kid at some point that is called Spider and Monkey, but I'll call Tarzan, who resides on Pandora and lives part time as a Na'vi, and who neither Colonel nor kid care about each other because the Colonel is a copy of the original dead Colonel, but the kid ends up saving the life of his copied father even after seeing all the hate, the hunt, and destruction Copy Colonel dishes out. Yeah... see what I mean.Moving on. At its core the story is a tale of life, death, and the fierce loyalty of family and tribe. It's also about connectivity to each other and nature. But I can't get passed the point of James Cameron saturating a good story with his self indulgent extra long scenes of all 👏🏻 the 👏🏻 things 👏🏻.I'm glad I saw it. I know I will see whatever is next for Avatar because I love movies."
"The movie was heart touching , my husband and I forgot we even had popcorn and drinks. The connection you feel with the characters is almost like they're your own family. Great depiction of love and hardships. The graphics were outstanding , and very impressive story lines.My husband and I are very excited and intrigued for the 3 movie!Well done!Meeting spider and knowing who he is against all odds was a very big character to me, working with and going against the sky people was brilliant. Defending his brothers as an ""alien"" showed true strength and bravery.The little brother connecting with the outcast was heart felt and made me cry when he looked at the memories. Never thought something like that would make me tear up.I wish I could give this movie more stars, Brilliant work!"
"Avatar: The Way of Water
is a much anticipated sequel to my favourite movie of all time. We watched it in of the big screen in 4DX. Imax/3D. Worth the extra to see the stunning aquatic visuals. Cameron proves himself a master of dramatic CGI and the latest SFX technology.My only criticism is the over-emotional story which could have gone different ways without leaving so many loose ends, such as ""Why did Col. Quaritch suddenly develop a ""father-conscience""?"", and ""why didn't the RDA simply wipe out the leaderless Omaticaya after Sully took his family and left them?"".The whole plot revolved around Quarritch's revenge, and how he and Jake Sully were marines of the same mould. His hero's path was identical to Sully's, even his lines ""outstanding"" reflected this similarity, and his great charisma.Worst of all, if they were the best the RDA had, why were Quaritch's marine avatars so easily defeated by just Jake and Neytiri on the hydrofoil, their ""home turf""?While overall a good story, and brilliantly acted by all, it missed several opportunities compared to the original Avatar.Perhaps, we can hope these questions may be answered in the next sequel. Let's hope we don't have to wait another ten years."
"Great visuals, narrative and acting. Without discrediting the first Avatar, which in itself is a great movie, in my opinion Way of the water far outshines it's predecessor. For the extra couple of quid to watch in IMAX, I would say it's well worth it!My only critique, and this is me really nit picking here, is that it's a very long watch and I'm not gonna lie to you, I had to take a tactical power nap around the 2 hour 20 minute mark. I feel like there's a few scenes which could've been saved for the director's cut, without jeopardising the quality of movie.All I have left to say is that I'm looking forward to the next one."
"Maybe Avatar shouldn't have had a sequel..This one reminded me of the time when i used to play magic the gathering at my local game-store, throwing in every good card i came across into my deck but then realising it wasn't winning games at all.Likewise, Avatar 2 has everything but all that equates into nothing when you sit through all tedious 3hour so of the movie.. in an effort to meet expectations for it's aesthetics, James Cameron threw away all the unique nuances that filmmakers use to make their films memorable and instead, throws in another gorgeous cgi-ed jellyfish and bubbles in the sea.Behind the excessive explosions, forceful tugging at the heartstring with its senseless killing of characters and predictable storyline, you wonder if this is actually the product of the same director that brought us Titanic!Not everything that glitters is gold. You would think a director with 40 years under his belt would realise that by now :("
"This is that kind of movie that you watch and forget it days later.If someone asks you about it, you would just say:'Oh, this movie is beautiful, but the story is not that great.'At some time I start wondering if it was the first Avatar. It was quite the same.New home, new neighbors, new culture and problems, etc.It seems to me that Jake Sully wanted thei children to pass throught the same as he did.But, I enjoyed the movie.The action scenes and the creatures are beautiful. You easily feel that that place actualy exist. It seems perfect in all details.Worth your time.Go watch it."
"Avatar: Way of the Water is a visually stunning film with some of the best CGI I've seen in a long time. The creatures and world-building are top-notch and really transport you to another world. The acting is also strong, with each actor bringing their character to life in a believable and compelling way.One of the biggest strengths of the film is its immersive world-building. The filmmakers did an excellent job of creating a fully realized and believable world for the story to take place in. The creatures and environments are all unique and detailed, and it's clear that a lot of thought and effort went into creating this world.However, one minor issue I had with the film was its pacing at times. While the overall story moves at a good pace, there are a few scenes that drag on a bit longer than necessary, which can make the film feel a bit slow at times.Overall, Avatar: Way of the Water is a fantastic film that is well worth a watch. The stunning visuals, strong acting, and immersive world-building make it a must-see for any fan of science fiction."
"I watched this in the cinema in 4dx and i was soo hyped for this. And... IT WAS AMAZING!!! But it probably will not be fun when you watch this in 2d or at home. The plot is almost non-existing but you should still watch this just because of the beatyness of the movie. The motion capture works excellent and were clearly 13 years better than the last one. This movie did have some scenes that were ok but unneccesairy. It would have been better when it was just over 2 hours. But i still enjoyed this in 4d and i am loving it. But this movie is also not made for rewatches and almost just exactly the same as the first one. All in all, you should go watch it in the cinema in 4d while you still can!!!"
"The way of water goes anywhere on this movie, 3 hours of nonsense, Pandora is such an interesting place but the things that James Cameron focus in are useless.Over and over the same things... short dialogs that goes nowhere... empty words, no conection they couldn't even create a new villian...As with Star Wars and Marvel , Disney is killing sci-fy...there is no intellect just explosions and fake nostalgia.Then James Cameron said that if the movie doesn't go well at the cinema he finish everything in the third film... well maybe its enough if this is the level.I miss the art that cinema use to be."
"Avatar: The Way Of Water does what any successful sequel in the (not so distant) past - think Top Gun: Maverick - and expands and explores the alien, but, at the same time, very Earth-like world of Pandora, especially its beautifully rendered seas and shores. Surprisingly, the High Frame Rate sequences didn't bother me as much I thought they would, but I could've done without them. Oh well.Story: Anyone looking for a story here should look elsewhere. This is a purely character-driven story, which is also why the action takes a back seat. There are two storylines running alongside each other, of which only the one focusing on the Sullys stands out with its simple, but effective worldbuilding.Characterization: Frankly, I didn't get to know more about the characters beyond what the trailers had already shown. We spend three hours with the Sullys and they go on quite the journey, but every time there's a conflict, the characters walk away with nothing more than a slap on the wrist. It gets rather frustrating at times, given that there would be plenty of room for growth, but by the end of the movie not much has changed. This movie has one of the worst antagonists of all time. Colonel Quaritch is a laughably bad villain with zero motivations as this isn't even the Quaritch that was killed in the first movie. What we got is a combination of Palpatine and Megatron (the latter in the sense that they gave the main villain a different appearance).Dialogue: They definitely picked the most quotable lines for the trailers or I might have seen those more times than I dare disclose here - 'Wherever we go, this family is our fortress'. Perhaps the biggest issue I have with the dialogue is how it hasn't improved since the first movie. Just watch the movie, bro!Performance: I would say Sigourney Weaver as Kiri is the only standout performer, while everybody else brings a good enough performance to the table. Zoe Saldana would've been great if she had more screentime and a bigger role, but she is barely in the thing. To me, Sam Worthington's acting felt a bit wooden, but it might just have been the way the character was written that didn't sit well with me.Cinematography: For a movie of this caliber, I expected more thought to be put into the movements and positioning of the camera. I can't help but compare it to 'The Batman' and 'Dune', where one can clearly tell how much effort was put into figuring out the best shot and angle for the scene. This isn't to say there aren't any visually striking shots and creative camera angles, but I would've preferred if the whole movie had gone through the same thought process.Production Design & Effects: It is by far one of the most visually appealing films of all time. Those colors are simply beautiful, to say the least. The VFX is seamlessly integrated into the real environments. Although, in the case of both Avatars, it might have been the other way around. More studios should take the time to completely see through the CGI work because the care of the VFX artists comes across the screen and I appreciate it very much. I for one wouldn't mind waiting a bit longer for the crazy mesmerizing spectacles this movie had to offer than the half-assed jobs they over at Marvel and other studios.Editing & Pacing: As I have mentioned it earlier, there are two storylines: one follows the Sullys running away from danger and the other follows the bad guys' malicious plan to destroy the Sully family. The latter is the subplot and undeniably the less interesting story; mostly because nothing of significance happens, but also because the bad guys disappear sometimes for twenty minutes at a time. This reduces their constant and imminent threat to nothing but a group of incompetent goons for whom it takes nearly the entire runtime to catch up to our protagonists. But I have to say, for a movie that is over three hours long and has one of the lengthiest second acts where nothing really happens, it wasn't the most challenging movie to sit through.Score/Soundtrack: The score here is superior and sounds majestic. I've loved it from the moment I first heard it in the teaser trailer, but I'm definitely on the fence whether it was overused or underused in the actual movie.Escapism & Immersion...Breaking: There is nothing wrong with a straightforward story that is rather predictable, so long as said story doesn't exceed the 120 minute runtime. Not even all the beautiful visuals could take my mind off some of the glaring plot holes that riddled this film. Without getting into details, let's just say, I was scratching my head more times than I cared to count, so even this vague information should give you enough idea as to what to expect. Some scenes go on for too long. There is also one or two smash cuts that baffled me, especially when the scenes should have lingered for a second or two longer for maximum emotional effect.Rewatchability: Now, it wasn't bad or good enough to warrant a second viewing in the cinema, but I am definitely looking forward to rewatching it in the comfort of my bedroom. While the movie wasn't as good as it could have been, I for one am interested where they are going next. I just hope it's going to be a place with more plot and less confusion.Despite all the criticism, I believe it is a worthy sequel and I am really curious where the story goes next. I am definitely critical about the sequel than I was with the first installment when that first came out. For the Avatar fans, I think every minute of waiting was worth it. As for myself, I am still undecided, but hopeful that the threequel will deliver a more cohesive experience that is may be on par with the first movie. Personally, I don't think it lives up to the hype, but that's just my opinion. The trailers are once again misleading, especially as some of the shots and sequences once put into context don't make much sense."
"OMG. James Cameron is sick!!! The visuals, graphics, and all details of Avatar 2: The Way of Water are insanely incredible!!! Watching Avatar 2 made me feel like I was there (Pandora) and it teaches me what FAMILY means. The sequel is perfect and it makes me want to watch the Avatar 3 real quick. I can't wait! To be honest, a day before I watched Avatar 2, I asked myself ""what Hollywood/American movie that could make me cry? Except Titanic, none"", I swear to God, I cried a ""waterfall"" over Avatar 2. For me, this is a family-oriented movie, it shows LOVE in family, teaches respect other cultures, and even appreciates the natures both flora and fauna. Overall, all James Cameron movies will never disappoint me. Thank you, James and Avatar family! Xoxo."
"It is yet another Shocking Delivery by sir, James Cameron. The Underwater Capture techniques What ever it took and the Costs, He is Right it very much... does pay itself, atleast you can say.The Graphics are so Realist , ofcourse, its is Pandora, the Most Beautiful Alien planet in the History of Movie making we are talking about.. so it obviously is also so .For a Graphics Perspective, for the CGI Industries abilities, Water Simulations are the weakest link of chain, especially for Ocean sims of Explotions on ocean surface. And, * YOU ONLY HAVE TO SEE * to actually understand what I mean when I say, it is the best Water graphics In Hollywood History. Even though the entire Movie, all Action, is on Ocean, not a single frame looks less than realistic perfect.In simple Words there is no need to prepare for any off-puting scenes in this Entirely Computer Generated Art work.And About Beautiful Visuals, don't forget it is 'Pandora' we are Talking about. IT IS AWESOME ."
"It almost feels like we never left Pandora. You jump right back in 13 years later like you just finished the first at the cinema. What an experience it was back then and what an experience it was again. Nobody can deny the beauty of the film. Visually it's one of the best pieces of cinema we've seen in a long time and will probably see for a while (until the next film that is). The story isn't quite as strong as the visuals. It's predicable, but then again so was the first. Some of the best scenes were the emotional one's which I think the film as a whole lacked enough of, such as the wasted romance with Tsireya. The narration during the film was great but there was so little for the mighty length of the film. Overall though the film had to introduce a lot, new characters, new villages and new relationships, but I felt they dealt with this well. It didn't drag, it wasn't so drawn out that you felt bored but it kept you invested enough throughout to want to see where it was all going, even if you could've predicted it all after the first 10 minutes. This world is mesmerising, it makes you want to see more of what it has to offer. That's why we'll be back for the third, perhaps not for the story, or the characters but to see what the beautiful world of Pandora has to offer, and to get the full experience you have to see it on the big screen!"
"Well, it's darn difficult to pull a sequel off in the first place, and to do so on the heels of a movie that I thought was 10/10 would be even harder.Visually stunning effects, but unless you want to watch swimming and jumping alien creatures for two of the three hours this movie lasts...and I mean LASTS, don't waste your money.Weak on plot, silly at times, and whimsical for much of the movie, I graciously gave it a ""5"" due to the CGI work. The worst part is that almost every spectacular event was entirely predictable. I actually leaned over to my wife about halfway through the movie as I was getting bored and sleepy, and said, ""This isn't very good."" She agreed.As a final note, I think that the original Avatar brought forth sooo many new ideas, characters, and fantasy thought processes, it made it extraordinarily difficult to meet up or exceed that amazing original."
"The visuals and action scenes are stunning. I consider the choice of moving the plot to a seaside area a good one. Recommend watching in 3D.The plot itself, on the other hand, leaves things to be desired. The premise is that Earth's resources are depleting so let's risk loosing what little we have on a personal vendetta against someone who was a charismatic leader of the resistance and gave us lots of trouble but has since stepped down. Character choices often make little sense. One liners feel childish and cringy. Despite the breathtaking visuals, the movie was way too long. I felt exhausted by the end and not in a good way."
I love absolutely love how this film presents its story structure with having the conflict being introduced but then having lots of mini problems characters have to solve I also love the beautiful world of pandora and the way James Cameron tells the story so you want to to root for the Navi people it had me on the edge of my seat in its climax with intense battle sequences A good thing I noticed was character development how returning characters and new characters were able to progress in a way that effects the climax and there actions in it This was also one of the best 3d movies I have ever seen and as small and big creatures go across the screen definitely a must watch film.
"When people write ""amazing visuals"" it's not only ""nice pictures"", it's amazing in the purest sense of the word: the viewer is amazed at the sights and sounds (and we watched the movie in an old fashion 2D screening). Add the acting of a great actors who cooperated in the past, action scenes from a director who does *great* action films for decades and you'll get a movie where you'll hardly feel the three hours fly by.Why is not a 9 or 10? Because the plot is mediocre and the movie sometimes feels like someone was simply stringing a collection of (breathtaking) scenes together. There are some plot holes and baffling plot decisions and I'm not sure what will stay with me in the coming years others than the visuals (which are, if it wasn't clear, amazing)."
"I loved the first Avatar. I watched it an unnecessary amount of times in theatres when it came out 13 years ago. Hearing about the 2nd one finally coming out, after what felt like a billion years, I was very skeptical and scared that it wasn't going to live up to the hype I had for it.This hype had been building for 13 years and I can say it was just about everything I could've hoped for. The characters, although many, were fleshed out enough to make me really feel for them. Maybe it's just the sap in me but I cried a few times during the movie. That's how connected I was to the characters and their own concerns, fears, and relationships with one another.If you compare it to the first movie I think you are going to disappoint yourself. The first movie had all the makings for a standalone movie. All the elements were there to make it a very strong movie. The second is just that. A second movie. It has the elements of a second, middle part of a trilogy or however then end up doing it. But even then it was just phenomenal.I loved it. I'm afraid my top 3 movies of all time are going to be avatar movies."
"I watched the movie in 3D which definitely fit the movie and influenced my experience of it to the better.Cameron has done a great job making a sequel without it being something we already have seen. The movie adds multiple new layers of stories and plot lines to get involved in. For instance the character Kiri who has a connection to the great Eywa which is still not explained entirely - leading up to multiple movies.We see a new side of Pandora with many different kinds of klans and avatars which also gives us magnificent sea creatures to admire as well.The movie made me touched, laugh and cry!Overall a very nice experience. I'm looking forward to the third movie and to discover new things of Pandora and the characters."
"The first Avatar movie opened about 13 years ago, and the story has progressed about that much time or perhaps a few years more. Jake Sully and Neytiri have four children, and the three oldest are undeniably teenagers.The Sky People return and make it known that Jake Sully is their number one Most Wanted. Jake convinces Neytiri that they need to leave the forest and go ask for sanctuary and refuge from a Na'vi sea clan called the Metkayina.Avatar: The Way of Water is the first look at the sea clans. I rewatched the first Avatar movie, and the only other clans pictured were the horse clans of the plains and the ikran people of the Eastern sea. The Metkayina have a more greenish skin tone, sea green eyes, webbing on their hands, and thicker tails. They hunt using spears rather than bows and arrows.It's entertaining witnessing Jake and his family learn to adapt to new creatures, their new environment, and even learn a new way to breathe, as they need to be able to stay submerged under water longer than they ever have before.It's tempting to think of the Avatar movies as animated movies, but they're largely, especially this one, motion capture movies. The actors are actually performing most of the actions seen on screen. They trained with free divers and learned to hold their breath underwater for long periods of time so they could shoot whole scenes without needing a breath. Kate Winslet apparently held her breath for at least seven minutes and 15 seconds. It's especially impressive that Sigourney Weaver, who is in her early 70s, performed the motion capture for a character who is a teenage girl.A couple of fun notes about the casting: the actor who plays the Metkayina chief or olo'eyktan is Cliff Curtis, who was in Whale Rider; the marine biologist is played by Jemaine Clement, who voiced the giant crab Tamatoa in Moana; and the new general commander of Pandora is played by Edie Falco, Mrs. Soprano herself.Avatar: The Way of Water prominently features Jake and Neytiri's children. One of the words spoken most often is ""bro"", ostensibly to remind you that the main characters are teenagers, and said so often that when a ""cuz"" or two is thrown in there, you feel irrationally relieved. It also illustrates how this movie is all about family. It depicts not only the Sully family, but also the extended family the Metkayina have with the majestic tulkuns, mighty whale-like creatures. It's about being the black sheep not only of your immediate family but also of an entire clan, or in Kiri's and Spider's cases, of an entire species.The visual images are gorgeous, the music is epic and moving, but the real heart of this film is how vividly it depicts the complex and challenging relationships we have with our parents, our siblings, our peers, and our rivals."
"It was really cool to see how they brought back some of the cast from the first movie and how they introduced the marine avatars, though all those marine avatars guys were killed off a little too easily. I think they should have been a little bit more effective than they were considering how lethal they were supposed to be in regard to their physical attributes mixed with their military training. Of course the visuals and special effects and the 3D were all fantastic, just like the first movie. They also added some pretty good new characters that will be interesting to see developed in future movies, especially one of those characters who may be a little conflicted with his feelings. There were some predictable or cliche scenes, like when a character is being chased by a big monster though you know they are going to survive. Or when a character was being held hostage at gun or knife point, but again, you know they were going to be rescued. I was disappointed to see how easily those gunships get shot down; you think by now they would have had arrow proof glass! The climax scene might have been a little too overdone and was a little messy, and I think their victory was a little too easy, like did not see enough sacrifice or loss from the natives like we did in the first movie. I was also wondering why we were introduced to this new military base and military general in the first part of the movie but they had really no part of the rest of the movie, although I get they will be a big factor in the movies to. There were a couple sort of sad scenes but this movie could have better portrayed the struggle of the natives, like the first movie did. Still a fun and very entertaining adventure movie and I'm looking forward to the next one!"
"Watched it in 4dx cinema the first time and really enjoyed it. Watched it in imax 3d the 2nd time round and was blown away!Ive learnt that I should never doubt James Cameron.What an amazing movie, a true masterpiece. It had everything you could want in a movie, the scale of this movie is just huge.The visuals are just out of this world, the sound track is classic Cameron (got lots of vibes from Alien and Titanic) the story and execution is masterful.I cant wait to see how this saga plays out! I just hope enough please go to watch this so he finishes his vision for the story amd make part 4 too.Depressing that we have to away another 2 years for the mext installment :-(This movie may just save the cinema!"
"First of all please watch this in IMAX 3D HFR
Its meant to be watched in thatHoly hell this film is a feat and also sets the new norm on special effects in moviesIts an out and out visual spectacle every frame and specially that hfr makes it feel like it's playing live in front of you and not like a movie the wait was extremely worth it if not for the story definitely go to witness this visual ride in theatreThe story is pretty straight forward it continues from the previous part the humans have not given up and are back with vengeance but i am extremely curious where the next parts will take this franchise100/100 A definite watch for any cinema visual lover."
"James Cameron did it!! I see why he had to wait 10 years to make this movie and it certainly did not disappoint! Cameron managed to make me feel nostalgic about a place that I haven't seen and miss people (avatars) that don't exist. The effects are so good that you find it hard to distinguish it from reality. Although the big time gap, the movie was still in the same style as before, the story was straightforward and interesting and didn't bore me for a minute despite the 3 hour duration of the movie. There were no empty scenes, the message of the movie is clear and makes us think about things we experience in our world, too.There were a few gaps in the plot but I can't even be mad about it.And Neteyam, poor baby, they made us love him all for nothing :(
I can't wait for the third part because there is so much potential in the series. And I certainly cannot wait for other tribes to be introduced!!"
"Just came out of the cinema and I already wish I could see it again. The story may not be groundbreaking as it touches similar topics as the first movie, but in my opinion does a good job in exploring them and the characters even more. In general, it was a very touching story with some really great moments that are going to be stuck in my mind for a while, Wait for another 3 parts. But of course, the best part of the movie was the world of Pandora itself. The forest scenes were again beautifully done, but the ocean shots just blew my mind. The new creature and environment designs are absolutely stunning, and every single organism is so beautifully animated and looks so real."
"I just created an account because I had to say how much this movie is incredible.I won't speak about the FX because the point is that you don't see them. There is no FX here, only the feeling that you are standing side-by-side the characters of the story, as if they were real. One must be blind for not seeing the beauty in this movie, or be a cold lunar rock for not feeling the emotions of the various characters.The magic of this movie is to be part of the story of the Sully family, share there rejoices and pains. The characters are superb, they are hyper expressive, they feel like they are real. It's not a story about people with extraordinary powers, or with convoluted plot twists, but a powerful story of a father and a mother that are trying to protect their family. This story allows us to see more of the fantastic world of Pandora, the various people living on it, the landscapes, some of the mysteries, and when the movie ends, it's like you are leaving some friends, and wish you could revisit them later.This is the first movie I've seen twice in a row at a movie theater, and my daughter even saw it three times! I was at first not a big fan of 3D cinema, but here the result is flawless. I felt it was a kind of once-in-a-while opportunity, and I can but only recommend to see it in a movie theater as well."
"What made RRR stands out against damm expensive Avatar 1/2 is the emotion or technically character development. At the end of Avatar, I didn't feel a single hangover of any scene, and that is bad. The whole movies seems to be made for awe graphics instead of character development and it's emotion. Interestingly, this is comparable to recently released Brahmastra (though that is comparatively worst) in terms of marketing.I think we have reached a point of cinema saturation. There's no motivation left to go to theatres, just watch a good story streaming. Sadly, Avatar seems to reinforce this belief among moviegoers."
"Is it too much to ask for one of the MOST expensive movies ever made to have excellent cinematography (which it does), an original plot, and some decent dialogue? Apparently yea.The boring story, long run time, terrible dialogue is carried by how visually stunning the movie is. I despise some culture, but it almost feels misogynistic for how poorly they wrote Zoe back into the story. She's pretty much useless and is an unhinged emotional wreck the entire movie.Shame that this is what James came up with after 10+ years. The original is so much better, hopefully this doesn't turn into a wait and $ee."
"I just came back from the cinema and I can definitely say that this movie is a masterpiece. The idea, the acting, the world of Avatars. Everything was so sophisticated and gripping. I loved it!!!It was amazing and some scenes were sooo emotional! I got a visual satisfaction as well as sensory. It made me want to live and experience life as those avatars did! I was sooo wonderful! My big respect to all the actors and the cast and everyone who created this movie! It was trully beautiful!I fell in love with the characters soo much that I had immense empathy to them in so many scenes! I loved them. And my heart was pumping faster as the bad guys got destroyed. It was somewhat a psychological therapy to watch evil get won over by good guys.I am still in shock.Best 3 and a half hours of my life."
"The movie was amazing and was definitely worth all these years of waiting. The magic of pandora hasn't been lost and it's shown. Don't even get me started on the greatness of detail and the way the actors nailed their roles. The acting is great, the effects are great, the storyline is great, everything is just amazing! But do be warned to bring tissues, by the end the whole theatre was crying. If I had the time I'd go see it a hundred more times. Everyone who can needs to go see this movie because it is just phenomenal and you won't regret getting out of your house to go see it, it is the experience of a lifetime."
"I gave all Avengers movies 10/10. When comparing with that scale and the other few movies I have watched in these few years, Avatar: The Way of Water deserves 15 stars. Yes, this movie was what I expect to experience in the theater whenever I go there. First time watching it, after a few minutes I forgot that I had a bucket full popcorns in my hand. This one has that level of immersion.The 13 years wait was not worth it, we deserved this one every year. But they didn't disappoint after taking that long.The fourth watch in the theater was still very fun. I hope the future movies will not drop in quality and just be released much faster.I know you watched it already, if not, what are you waiting for?"
Avatar is a prime example of computer generation and animation at its best. I was absolutely blown away by the beauty of this movie and heart wrenching story line. I Watched this film in 4DX and I felt like I was right there with the characters. When I see negative reviews I really just do not understand what people want from this type of movie they got everything they possibly could from this film. It was over a three hours long but went by so quickly. The special effects were out of this world. I really hope this is only the beginning for avatar movies and really hope they're more to come. The actors did an incredible job of portraying the characters and made it so believable. Amazing!
"James Cameron has done it again by continuing the story of Jake Sully and his family. It is strange to think there was a 13-year gap between The Way of Water and its predecessor. The sequel perfectly transitions the story from the original and answers some of the questions left open at the conclusion of the first movie. The acting and dialogue is excellent and gives you a sense of witnessing an actual culture that could exist out there somewhere. Emotions are very strong, as were in the original film. The film also has strong balance between action and drama scenes, with the 3+ hour runtime being appropriate. Finally, the setting is spectacular to view. The environment, camera work, and CGI are beyond anything that has graced the film industry previously."
Visually stunning movie. I felt as though I was on Pandora.Terribly long but visually stunning - one forgets you are on another planet. Very slow mid movie and you keep wondering when the turning point will occur. But the cinematography is so compelling that I felt I wanted it to continue on and on. The world created on screen is so compelling you don't want it to end. I would be content to watch 3 hours of just exploring the wonderful world of Pandora. The undersea world is gorgeous. The story is secondary to the world created by the CGI TEAM. James Cameron is brilliant. Cannot wait for third movie.
"**LITTLE SPOILERS BUT LOTS OF EMOTIONS**I have not yet watched the first movie, however the movie still makes some sense. I make apologies since the comment is purely based on my personal experience with the film.The perfect measure word for this movie is ""a piece"". Not a piece of artwork, but a piece of ****. I can't believe that after Cameron criticizes so hard on Super Heroes movies he decided to make THIS. A 3 HOURS LONG WELL-EDITED MUSIC VIDEO. My ADHD started hitting right after watching this for 20 minutes. I was squirming in my seat. Sure this might be a "" me problem"" but those vivid visuals with endless fighting scenes drove me crazy.I left the theatre hearing a few people commenting on the stereotypical ""mother roles""- women being great warriors albeit being overprotective towards their loved ones. But I think Cameron just has a thing against humanity, doesn't matter men or women. He portrays majority of the human group as selfish invaders. I guess it aligns with the theme of ""desires vs love"". It is almost like one of those educational environmentalism movies your high school teacher makes you watch and study from.The central message of the movie is VAGUE yet the characters are flat- straightforward motivation. Traditional character traits. Protective mother, strong father, sensitive sister, rebellious younger brother with a role model older brother, along with a young sister whose role is to be protected and make ""funny"" lines. I do not understand why he made an entire movie just for a migration story.Honestly I would appreciate this movie more if it's shortened to about 2-2.5 hours. But who cares? It's just me screaming my own opinions here and I've never watched Avatar 1 or Titanic anyways."
"After thirteen years, Jake and Neytiri live with their offspring within Pandora's forest. Peace doesn't last long. The Sky People return, pushed by chief security officer Quaritch, reincarnated as AVATAR.The Navi must retreat to Pandora's beach sights where they find new allies. Jim Cameron gives THE WAY OF WATER time to explore new characters and underwater worlds.The result is stunning. Jake and Neytiri's children, especially Lo'ak, find adventure with Pandora's sharks and whales within a sanctuary cove. NIRI portrayed by Sigourney Weaver finds the new sacred tree eventually.Quaritch gets admirably equipped with a new water-boarded gunship and hunts EYWA mammals with no remorse in order to obtain the new UNOBTANIUM called AMRITA.HERE is everything what you can ask from tentpole Hollywood event movie.9/10."
"I am not normally in love with cgi movies. When you can literally do anything on the screen, it loses it's wonder. And yet, this movie mesmerizes. The plot is simple, pretty much a rehash of the original. Yet I found the movie engaging. At over 3 hours it should have seemed to be dragging, but it didn't. The movie is as much a visual work of art, and the plot, while thin, kept me engaged, and while predictable, the movie still managed to be exciting. And yes, see it in the movie theater, with big sound, a big screen, and 3D. It just wouldn't be the same at home, no matter how big a tv you have, or how great a sound system. But pick a theater with nice reclining leather seats. At over 3 hours, you'll be glad you did."
"The film Avatar 2's first positive point is the fact that it does not linger on the job before taking the main characters to where the major part of the film will take place. The big positive point that we can recognize in the film is that after 13 years, the special effects are incredible which gives us a breathtaking visual experience, I was clearly not disappointed on this point.In terms of the story, it's certainly not the scenario of the year, but that's not what we're asking for and the proposed scenario works very well without surprising us. The villain of this film is more developed than in the first and even more interesting even if that of the first was in my opinion more charismatic. Jake's family is interesting and the fact that the film is not centered on the father but on the children makes for a refreshing experience.The film is 3 hours long and I felt the 3 hours were over because even though the film was visually stunning, I found the story at certain points to be longer than at other points when time passed more quickly and where we were more invested in the film.Each of the children have their own and interesting personality and the environment in which they evolve is frankly very cool to discover. The eldest is the least developed character in the story, which made me predict his death, which didn't take long, but the other characters have potential and I hope that development will continue in this direction for the next sequels.To finish with the positives, the fight scenes which are like in the breathtaking first film, I was glued to my seat watching them. Something I really enjoyed as an avid reader and those are hard references to have but whaling is full of Moby Dick references. A whale alone and not in a herd that is also smart enough to counter the boats that chase it. There's also the moment when the chief whaler holding the harpoon gets his arm cut off, which is a direct reference to Captain Ahab's lost leg in Moby Dick. In addition to these references, James Cameron shows us again in this film his mastery of the marine world, in particular with the sinking boat at the end of the film which inevitably recalls Titanic and the scene is perfectly mastered.Now in the negatives, there is in the first place the whole story around the pariah whale which in my opinion was the least interesting moment of the film. Then in the small details is that they did not explain after the accident of Kiri, the oldest daughter of Jake Sully, how did they manage to contact the scientists who remained in the forest but I procrastinate a little.Another negative point but much more personal this time, it's a criticism that I already had on the film levy and it's only my feelings but I never managed to take seriously all this spiritual side, this side connected with animals and nature, with the tree which is considered as a divinity à la Yggdrasil which in my opinion is a bit forced. I've always had trouble with these kinds of themes in films where they create sorts of religions. Customs for the film. Taking this sort of thing seriously is quite complicated for me and for a film where the characters are so centered on this side, I was not really convinced.Another negative point is the character of Spider. We feel that he is there only to make the villain feel empathy, otherwise he would have been useless. In the last negative point, it's Jake Sully, we feel that the writers wanted to make him much more in the background to develop his children and in the film he acts as a father figure but apart from at the end, he will have spent his time arguing with his children and even if the film explains to us that he educates them more in a military way than in a paternal way, I found it a bit of a shame to put him so much in the background.To conclude, the film was like the first part, a real visual slap and the 3 hours are felt only slightly, the film makes us have a great time through the discovery of new characters and their development in this new marine environment, the specialty of James Cameron, the experience provided have succeeded and the film, even if it does not have the most incredible scenario of the century, makes us have a good time."
"I love the movie! I think that, when you watch Avatar, you're not expecting a big story, but only a perfect CGI, that makes nature look beautiful. I think this movie is really good, and the CGI is to die for. The story isn't the best, but is still a good story. Love the actors.The soundtrack is good, one of the best soundtracks I heard this year. I already watch the movie twice, and I still did not get sick of it.In my opinion, the thirteen years we've been waiting for worth it. It's a beautiful and really well done. I think that no one can hate it, and everyone should try watch it. It is definitely a must see."
"I enjoyed the movie, but I don't see why every big block buster these days feels the need to implement Maori culture, i dont understand what makes them so special when America has natives, Canada, Australia all have natives too... most of Latin America have tribes, Africa have tribes everywhere.. I know that nz Weta FX was involved, but that doesn't mean everything has to have Maori influence. I think it would be great if for once NZ could help produce an international movie with out feeling the need to leave a cultural mark. Other than that, it was as good as I was expecting, albiet feeling a bit rushed for a movie 3 hours long."
"The visuals of this film are incredible, colours are vibrant and the scenes are overall incredible. The action is shot fantastically with truly jaw dropping cgi. However the fight scenes did feel a bit like rehashing of the first film especially the final battle, very similar in the way things looked with slight tweets as to details of the battle.However I felt like the story they wanted to tell could have been done with an hour less film and still be just as amazing. I didnt seem to get much connection with the sons as characters but felt like the building block ls for development are there.Overall an epic that must be watched just bring lots of snacks."
"This movie may have a very basic story, but when has that ever been a bad thing? James Cameron has done it yet again. We all know what he has in store for us throughout the next Avatar movies and if this movie is a sign for what's to come, I am very intrigued. Avatar 1 and 2 are both meant for world building and to help connect us to these characters. They were never meant to be the most miraculous story we've ever seen, YET. This is a very thought provoking movie with amazing visuals and a genuine message of the importance of family. Another important aspect of this movie was how you could not feel that 3 hour runtime at all. The last hour of this movie is absolutely stunning and spectacular! I cannot wait to see what is in store for Avatar 3!"
"Avatar: The Way Of Water just sticks to it's very long long long landing! The first Avatar movie had already passed through years and people have been waiting for it for already decades, and now it's here! When the first movie just ever got released, I was very little yet to watch it on theatres but I had a first glimpse of that movie when my Dad is watching it on his TV. Years later, I decided to watch the first Avatar myself and it's Remarkably Gorgeous! And this time, after watching the first one, I'm already anticipating for the second one to got released and the trailer just got dropped in the media!! Months later, I watched it on theatres and what in the name of Eywa did I just watched..... IT'S FREAKING BEAUTIFUL!!! Calling for all of the Visuals, Characters, World Building, Culture, and the Eye-Catching Creatures are just so mind blowing! The story is so simple that made me easy to munch to it and focus on more of the beautiful world of Pandora! I may call this a masterpiece because James Cameron is a kind of a director that was so creative, so talented and so productive that madd this things all happen that made a massive world phenomenon!"
"This film is very good, in my opinion, the avatar design is also good. For those of you who haven't watched it, you can try watching it because the film is very exciting! Besides that, in my opinion, the avatar design is also smoother than the previous avatar. For me too, this second avatar also took quite a long time to watch but this is very exciting. And now Neytiri already has 4 children, 1 of 4 children is adopted. And Sully's family also moved to another village to live there. Those who want to try to watch can watch it directly in the cinema. The avatar currently airing also contains a sad scene."
"This was a sad movie, very sad only. After waiting such a long time to be presented with this travesty... I'm not even really surprised, but it still hurts when even thin hopes are dashed.I refuse to believe that James Cameron had much if anything to do with writing this. It reeks of hollywood swine infecting and botching everything. No intelligence, sense or even logic. There's no creativity either, they just recycled a bunch of recognizeable favorites from the original - and not well, just facepalmingly shameless cut and paste.The movie seems more like different imitation franchise, where they took the script from a low budget rip-off, hired Cameron's effects time and got Uwe Boll to direct.Suffice to say I'm not interested and however many more installments follow. As I feared Avatar has gone the way of The Matrix. An amazing first movie that is the only one worth watching again, but worth it forever."
"This movie jaw dropping. The visuals are unlike any other film i've seen, and it uses it to its advantage. It makes it extremely immersive, easy to get lost into. But it also serves as a curtain to hide the problems and holes the plot and characters have. James cameron has set himself up for failure right from the beginning by adding too many new characters to the story with very little explaining, the only part being the narration from jake. These characters are easy to be attatched to, yes, but don't have much individual personality. James cameron explores a bit of interaction within the family but doesn't have the time to explore it fully. He bit off way more than 3 hours could chew. The older brother, whos name i forget, was a very crudely created character, with his only personality being to watch over his siblings. It is said he is the ""perfect brother"" but this is never shown. He has no personality apart from his relationship with his younger brother. This is similar with all the characters, with little to no time to dive into their characters. There is always someone who is neglected in every scene, a possible personality left out. Like the absence of jake's wife during the water scenes. She is only seen comforting kittie/katie (im not sure which) after her little crisis, a scene that adds nothing to the overall movie. Im sure it will be addressed in one of the sequels, but serves no purpose in this film. It wastes time that could be exploring the older brother and making his sacrifice more meaningful.Yes, the film is beautiful to look at (especially in 3d), but in contrast the narrative details are a dumpster fire. Impressive directing by cameron, but poor writing once again. But he is improving from the last avatar, thankfully.Dangerously hopeful to see what the sequels hold."
"Its a copy of avatar 1 with less improvement in script. It is boring to. Avatar 1 is 10 times better than Avarar 2. I saw the movie in 3d at pvr, i wondered while watching the movie whether i booked tickets for 3d or 2d. I only confirmed after realising that okay i wore glasses so it is a 3d show. Total money waste. Story also not extraordinary, an ordinary story thats all. I could spot many scenes from avatar 1 which are directly copied to avatar 2. Story also same no change. Since both the movies are James cameron's he escaped from copy rights infringement. I was waiting for avatar 1 sequel eagerly for almost 2 years and very much disappointed."
"AVATAR is a visual masterpiece from James Cameron and lives up to the hype and expectations. The Story is pretty very much predictable but the visual elements hold the viewers experience together.The underwater scenes are a treat for the eyes and one will get immersed in the experience and become a part of the fantastic fantasy world that James Cameron creates. Acting by is good, Sound design is fantastic....to capture and create underwater sounds is a great technological achievement for the AVATAR team. The length of the film was the only down sider for me, however one may argue that it was necessary to keep the audience in teh fantasy world and feel a part of it.Overall must watch for the experience."
"I thought this movie would just be one of those sequel cash grabs that is nothing more but mediocre. But I was surprised at how good it actually was. The vfx, cgi and choreography was outstanding and honestly the story was surprisingly really good and for me personally better than the original. Most sequels really just avoid the 1st main character and let their kids take over the whole movie but Jake was actually involved in the main story which surprised me. This is arguably the best sequel to a live action film ever made not only visually but story wise.But an important note, I'm not saying the first film was in any way bad. The cgi was impeccable for its time and the story was good but kind of predictable. In the second film doesn't show the same amount of predictableness as the first one. I didn't expect Neteyam to die and Jake to live. Also I didn't expect for Colonel Quaritch to get saved by Spider/Miles.Overall i rate the original a clean 9 while this one a 10.I understand making a sequel that can be compared to its original movie is hard and it shows that James Cameron and the rest of the team tried to impress the audience and succeeded. I cant wait to see the rest of the Avatar movies and other James Cameron's movies he is working on."
"I must praise the world and effects before than story. Please don't misunderstood me story was good but that world build very beautifully around characters. The mits, norms, culture and heritage was carefully put in that world. It's like a poem for nature because while watching you're feeling the idea of that world. The world breathes and talks with the characters. Example the animals, plants, landscapes, sky and more side subject like that gathers around the characters and creates mitos, norm and religion in the heart and mind of the characters and this is reflecting on the story which even story doesn't so shockable. Story isn't the best one or revolutionary but it was fun and part by part it's getting more philosophical and exciting. Story shows us a classic family concept and didn't turn raw pilot in somewhere. Story didn't shine much but the world and heritage out shine that."
"I enjoyed the original film, but having a 13 year gap really made me worried about whether Cameron could pull it off, I mean it seem like the first film had a solid ending. But here we are, back on Pandora with a better story, new characters and superior visuals.Avatar: The Way of Water is a successful sequel that levels up on everything that came before it. Once again the story is basic and simple, and while lots of viewers will have issue with this, I found it refreshing because this is the type of movie that I could watch with my entire family, and my wife will get something out of it as well as my kids. And this is really what James Cameron is trying to do, he's targeting a global audience that can transcend gender, age, ethnicity, etc. The fact of the matter is that if ""Aliens"" or ""T2"" came out today people would complain about how simple the story is too.This movie is about the combination of all film elements that entertain and engage an audience. This time around the emotional connection was deeper than the original film, the scenery is beyond incredible, I mean once the movie goes underwater my jaw dropped and was completely mesmerized. And finally the action scenes are superb and in my opinion better than the first film, of course this has never been a weakness of James Cameron.The plot and message of this film, like the original is about the environment and the conservation of nature, but the story is about family and all the issues that come with that. I was lucky to have watched this on IMAX 3D and I would recommend anyone out there to do the same if you can. Finally, I can see what Cameron has in store for this franchise, the world building will continue and the characters are now in place for growth as well as the mythology in Pandora and that one messianic character that is being set. I want more of this world and I hope we get it sooner than later."
"The long awaited ""Avatar: the way of water"", sequel to the original ""Avatar"", is an amazing movie from the technical perspective. Beautiful cgi and cinematography undoubtedly is the wonder of the movie, as for the plot - cliche.The plot almost identically mirrored the original film, where humanity once again brings nothing but destruction wherever it lays their hand. The main essence of the film was family but in a sense it put it in a cliche frame, that was disappointing. Even though I do agree on the importance of family, I excepted better from Jake, not to run and escape the growing problems.When Avatar (2009) was released I was a child and ever since I have been fascinated with the world of Pandora unfolded in the movie. At the time it was nothing like before, nothing I or anyone else had seen. It was truly breathtaking and amazing for its time, still is, yet the sequel has diminished my love for Avatar mainly because of the plot.Even though the screenplay and plot have been highly disappointing, nonetheless I admire the hard work of the technical team of creating Pandora in its full glory."
"Nothing short of utter disappointment...13 years for this? James Cameron. What happened here? You have some staff firing to do.... maybe even fire yourself for this one if you have to.Artists and graphics staff - On point 100%
Stunning beautiful yes. All credit to them.Everyone else - Absolute garbage.Let me start off by saying that the acting of the kids and youth is absolutely pathetic.Dialogue of youth and main characters is barf worthy.... if you are an intellectual, hell. Even a decently smart individual, the dialogue will make you cringe. Think ""Bruh"" ""Cuz"" ""Dude"" What is this doing in a movie that is supposed to be mystical and magical?The actor that plays Spider is the worse offender. He doesn't know how to act at all. How did he end up on this movie? This young actor must be a child of James Cameron's friends or something.I was crying and wanting to go into fetal position at some point. Animal and wildlife cruelty is an ongoing part of this story plot. And although this is a real world problem ... it needs real solutions and motivation to empower people who love the planet to take action.As a strong animal and wildlife activist.This movie made me feel small and belittled
The native people of Avatar forest and islands are portrayed as ignorant and buffoon like. They want to fight back but have no plan and ""leadership"" doesn't lead the people. Big influences like big screen directors need to help empower people now and future generations to stand against wildlife and animal cruelty. To educate on real solutions. Even if it is fiction. Fiction can still instill real life lessons. Not this. This is humiliating.I cried in one scene because the animal massacre was full blown and nobody could actually help. Avatar people are hissing and bickering amongst themselves while mass massacre takes place.I don't agree that Jake Sully kept his last name in his new home as a new species. To me this portrays white heroism. His character as a white male of privilege was shown to be entitled and causing more problems than solutions yet people still followed him.He didn't better the species. This movie was just a real doozy. So tragically sad."
"The movie is a visual spectacle, but the storytelling was slow and lacks of good content. You're expecting to be wowed like the first time, but it came out short in many ways. It doesn't feel like a roller coaster ride like the first movie and lacks of emotional depth. There are quite a few new characters in this movie so I feel less attached to any of them. They are fun to watch but failed to connect at an emotional level. I guess it's because the character did not seem to develop much as a people of Pandora. Hopefully the next one could live up to the expectations. Perhaps it is still to early to judge. Let wait until the whole franchise roll down it's curtain."
"James Cameron's new ocean themed project is visually impressive as expected, but mostly a sea of cliche's horrible dialog and stunning predictability.It was like watching a 2 hour episode of 90210, complete with all the teen angst, rebellion, bullying and fighting and bro's you can handle. I think they used the word Bro at least 1000 times. How do a bunch of teens who have never been to earth, and barely even seen another human, speak in strings of North American slang.This painful teen romp was followed an hour of save the whales, planet, natives, religion, culture (insert cause here) propaganda.How do they have several billions worth of equipment specifically designed for ocean use, when they are based in a forest, and didn't even know Sully was hiding out with the water people till half way through the movie?I was also wondering what was the point of adding Tarzan boy to movie, but then I realized at end. Can you say Avatar 3?I rate this a 4 for being a well polished turd."
"First of all, I see a lot of reviews criticising th e movie for his ""really bad"" story. I mean yeah, it's not really original but it wasn't as bad for a movie that has to be good and realatable for the mamority of people. It's a classic action movie story that isn't as bad that it would distract or intimidate. At the other hand the reviews and professionall critics say that the visuals are ""just top noch"" and bassicly the best possible for this period of time. And I really, really have to disagree with that, cause sometimes they just looked as if I was watching a trailer for the next AAA game. I mean most of the time they're fine sure and the flying mountains, the forest and the Navi's aren't the problem. But the underwater creatures are really not that impressiv, especialy when they're big. And I know, water is difficult to animate and I'm not an expert in this at all, but as a viewer I can say that I've seen much better stuff in cinema in the last years.Well the movie wasn't a waste of time or something it was still entertaining to watch and obviously the action scenes are still great, le in pretty much every James Cammeron movie. I just wouldn't advice you expect the movie of the year, if you go to cinema."
"Overall it's worth watching at the theater because the visual experience is stunning and you really can explore Pandora with them. Watch it on a large screen.However, talking about the storytelling, it's not brilliant because the events are almost the same as those of the first one. I didn't get bored thanks to the visual though. It could've been told even on Earth, without the Na'vi.Another problem is the whale-hunting description. I understand they don't like hunting intelligent animals and that we should protect them. However, he portrayed as if the Asian were catching them, taking out only its precious part and then throwing the body. It's not accurate and he should have been more sensitive about the accuracy."
"Avatar, the way of the water!Finally, a break from chaos and superheroes saving the earth from super villains. Rather, this one talks about family values strongly in its own way. Am sure lot would feel the same and this is really a much needed break.Cameron knew this better.Master always takes (creates) the right path. You would've witnessed the same in trailer. No much bragging. Not much noise. Bit simpler and straightforward.Still, we need such linear movies with simpler script and strong message.Watch the first part and definitely go for this in theatres.Close to heart ! Period."
"Unfortunately, the sequel feels like a copy of the first movie, with better CGI. The opening act of takes care to reset everything achieved in the first part - we are back to square one as a setup for the next films. New characters, yet very repetitive setup.What is more, the script did not make sense to me on multiple occasions. The red thread somehow manages to be lost. It felt like stories within a big story, but not all of them fit together in terms of pace and resolution. Perhaps it is simply the movie lenght. As if it had to be pushed to such a massive runtime just for the sake of hitting 3:20.Overall, I enjoyed the beautiful shots. Yet, it gave me limited satisfaction and I was hoping the movie ends long before it rolled the credits.I do not intend to watch the other sequels."
"I give this a solid 8.7, rounding up to 9.True, there are a lot of characters not very memorable. Action sequence feels the same as the predecessor. But James Cameron hits a home run to the true plot point of the movie, the preservation of our world's oceans.Visually stunning, and worth every single penny and then some. You would do it injustice if you did not watch this in the 4DX experience format; moving/vibrating seats, realistic atmosphere (water jets, air jets, mists, and 3D glasses. It's on a another level. Tickets for that experience costs us $25 a seat (not including concessions). The first Avatar movie took 11 years to develop the tech and finish the movie. It helped produced all the Marvel movies in the 2010s. You can see why Disney bought the rights. It took another 13 years to develop the newest tech (adding onto the previous) to produce this eye candy. You can only imagine all the movies that will come out in the next decade using this technology. Even if you don't think you will like this movie, if you love movies with CGI, come out and support the tech and the new people who developed it.I'm not going to spoil the movie for you but what I will say is that if you don't plan to watch it in theatres with the maximum 4D experience. You will miss out. It won't be the same watching this on your television on later release. Unless you have a home theater with vibrating chair, 3D format, and water/mist jets shooting at you. It's worth it."
"This movie takes exposition and foreshadowing and rams it down your throat with excruciatingly long scenes and poorly written dialogue. Brought to you by the same person that wrote and directed Titanic and Terminator? You don't say? You can't call them ""Easter eggs"" when the scenes last that long. I can't think of a less interesting villain, either, and with only a smidge more motive than in the first movie. And the protagonist? He certainly didn't get any wiser over the last 14 years.Gee, but the visual effects were pretty, and the female leads were good, despite all of the macho B. S., which is why I give it two stars.What a waste of over three hours."
"Went to see it with my gf. Off course we appreciated the national geographic tour - very pleasing for the eyes. We had things to talk about on our way back / harmony with nature, jinn out of the bottle, native people, woman vs man in crisis, family roles, Arjuna, blind consommation, etc.It was fun to see Cameron explore back some of is thematics. I see so many influence from all around (manga, video games and movie), it's not necessary positive or negative but it does made me feel like we were talking the same language.There's always this question of if a movie should live by itself and not be judge from things exterior from it ; in this case, I appreciated the subtexts; knowing that Cameron is deeply into exploring seas - it would have been fool not to use is immense visibility to addresses what is soon to be a - sombre passé- here on earth.Not much to say without spoiling; go see it in theatre, than learn to vote with what you buy."
"A beautiful movie that shows the world in an incredible way, sadly the whole movie plot and specially the end are repetitive full of holes in the plot and just pointless, setting up the next 15 movies. Has some great aspects but as a movie it failed.I thought it would be a great sequel and went in interested in what would happen, when only thing I got was a lot of effects and little story for 3 hours, I was disappointed that the same sequence of events repeats it self 3 times with no learning being done.Sadly feels like money grab I hope they try to make one more good one and just let it die."
"Weak story , army dudes after Jake Sully...very weak...waste if time and money, I'm sure there was a better plot somewhere that got lost for ""reasons""...if there are alien species in the Avatar Universe they could have done it much better with different civilizations and magical evil enemies .. James Cameron and gang are old, I hope they go bigger in the next one else this franchise will be very boring...Apart from the 5/10 plot, the rest is really good, visuals are 10/10 and music is good I would say 9/10 to be generous...acting is good so the movie is minimum a 7 ...the plot being about catching sully killed it for me ...nice one time watch..."
"I'm not some die hard Avatar fan so I went to see this without much fanfare or expectations. We saw in 3D which is the first time in at least 10 years for me. Literally zero improvement in the experience. What a waste. The movie overall completely lacked a solid plot. I think it was revenge? Whatever it was it was not interesting. A big military ogre, engineered to look like the guy he wants to kill, chasing after children to use against their parents, murdering innocent animals and destroying villages of innocent people in his wake. What a way to waste 3+ hours on a Sunday morning. At least an hour was pointless, bloated battle scenes. If I had not rode with friends to the theater I would of left early. Sure, I guess it had cool visuals. The interaction with the water people was interesting. But the rest sucked. Testosterone filled men, destroying land that is not their own, murdering the innocent natives because they have something of value. Sound familiar? I'm so sick of this narrative. What is wrong with people that they find this entertaining? I wish I could get my Sunday morning back."
"It feels good to be back on Pandora! With the way James Cameron has written 'Avatar: The Way of Water' it immediately feels both familiar and refreshing. I could go on and on about the visuals, but we all knew the film was going to be impressive to look at. What did surprise me about this film was how invested I became in its narrative. I love the familiar dynamics going on with each of the central characters. At just over 180 minutes, James Cameron has a lot of story to tell and he does so in a fashion that's both dazzling and compelling. This is a movie with true heart! I can't wait to watch this in theaters several more times!"
"Absolutely gorgeous film. A really good use of the 3D technology. Definitely recommend viewing this one in the theater for the best, most emersive experience. It did not feel like a three hour move at all. The story is seamless and captivating the entire time. Good progression without feeling rushed or dragging in parts. Excellent story development, continuing on the the themes established in the first movie. Really touching. Thoroughly enjoyed the new characters - excellent integration into the overall plot. They really nailed the animation - the underwater scenes are a marvel to watch. Very much looking forward to the next installment. I hope we don't have to wait so long next time."
"I hear such high praise of the effects and how this movie is better in every aspect than the first. But I sadly must dissagree. Yes, the effects are amazing, but considering the time-gap the first movie is still just as good in my opinion. Both movies aim to reimagine what's possible at the time when it comes to CGI and MOCAP, and both movies does it well. So well, infact, that you often forget it's not real.But that's where the good things end. I tried not to expect much story-wise as this was not the strong point of the first movie either. But when faced with cliché and predictable one-liners for 3 hours straight it is hard to not be somewhat critical. Should we really just base our opinions on the effects? Should a god film not also teach you something, make you think and make you invested in the characters?I wish I could ignore the weak points, and once again I hope that this movie, just like the first, tries to set the stage for what's coming. I feel like I learned almost nothing new about Pandora, and the humans are villainized to the point of no return. Maybe I will have to watch it again with no sound to enjoy what others feel is worth a perfect score.As a fan of the first movie and the idea of a new, exciting world; ""Avatar: The Way Of Water"" does few things different from what I can already enjoy while diving back home on good old planet earth."
"The Way of Water was promised as an epic tale of monumental proportions with heavy loses starting from the get go. Having anticipated this movie for weeks, what I received was a watered down version of A1. The stunning visuals go without saying but such feats never keep a film afloat.The films biggest flaw is that it features too wide an array of characters leaving the audience no time to explore any of them in depth; you barely get your feet wet with one subplot before it moves you onto the next with the most interesting story points being completely dropped. It ends at the same point where it began, there's no dramatic shift in any of the characters unlike A1 where the hero, Jake Sully; undergoes a total transformation. No one really changes.A film is only as good as it's villain and here it suffered from a lack of one. The main antagonist was the resurrected Miles Quaritch of A1, but despite now being in a tougher Na'vi body was held back most the time to the point of being unthreatening. Rather he struggled with inner moral conflicts yet the film did not focus on him enough to give these conflicts weight.The hero, Jake was not deep enough to warrant the constant attention, you felt his struggle but he's already become who he wants to be; there's no meaty enough story with him that can carry a three hour movie.Lastly we had a new element of Kiri; the adopted daughter of Jake Sully with unusual powers. The few moments we have of her tease at a story far more interesting than the environmentalist message of don't hunt whales that we got. She was sadly a side character.The film does not suffer from uninteresting characters but they were all horribly miscast. The only way Cameron can impress people now is if he makes a comeback for when this film ultimately gets panned.Stephen Lang's performance is this only thing worth rewatching."
"Avatar 2 is the sequel to the 2009 science fiction film Avatar, directed by James Cameron. The film follows Jake Sully, a former Marine who has been living among the Na'vi, the indigenous people of Pandora, and his wife Neytiri as they try to protect their home from a mining company that wants to exploit Pandora's natural resources.The film features a mix of live action and computer-generated imagery (CGI) and has released in theaters in the 16th of December 2022. It is story explores the relationships between the Na'vi and the humans who have come to Pandora.Avatar 2 is one of several planned sequels to the original film, with the story expected to span a total of four films. The film has been in development for several years, with production delayed several times due to the complexity of the CGI and other technical challenges.I won't go into further details to evade spoilers. However, the movie is highly anticipated and had a popular release."
"Just saw the premiere of Avatar: The Way of Water today and boy was it visually STUNNING!! When I saw the first movie, I thought it was a masterpiece that couldn't be outdone - until NOW.This one focused on family, something we are sorely missing in today's society, and yes, I mean the nuclear family, with a mother, father, and children. We are so focused on family being whatever we want it to be, which is fine by most of society, but a father and mother is integral to the success of a family - sorry, not sorry.It was a VERY long movie and quite intense, but there were a lot of morals to learn from it.Well done, Cameron, very well done, indeed.And yes, there is another sequel in the works, but hopefully, we won't have to wait another 13 years to see it."
"This movie contains incredible storyline and graphics. The creativity involved here is amazing from the invented language to the animals. Everything seems foreign and original to anything found on earth.This movie contains incredible storyline and graphics.

This movie contains incredible storyline and graphics. The creativity involved here is amazing from the invented language to the animals. Everything seems foreign and original to anything found on earth."
"I have seen most of the IMAX releases of movies, I think only a few were quite impressive, but I did not expect to witness such an experience in my life! There were times so immersive, that I felt like I was part of the movie! Mr. Cameron really delivered a masterpiece in visual effects and I have to confess that I did not realise that the movie lasted 3+ hours, because I was swept away by the solid scenario, the visual orchestration and the amazing performance of the actors. I will definitely go again to see it with my kids, because I believe that they must be inspired by efforts of such magnitute and also trigger their imagination."
"When you take away all the fancy CGI, Avatar The Way of Water is left with nothing but a clunky plot line and boring cheesy dialogue.Don't get me wrong, this movie is a treat to the eyes. The entire six stars from me comes solely from the beauty of the world.But don't be fooled by that. James Cameron should know better. Good movies are more than visual effects. It's as if he pulled the script straight out of 2008, and didn't edit a single thing. Much of the dialogue was dated and uncreative. I had many moments of genuine cringe. (The Australian man was the worst of it).This entire film basically renders the goal of the first film obsolete. In fact, you could watch this film alone and not need much filling in on the first one. Why did we bring the bad guy back from the dead? The colonisers are back but Jake Sully's going on hideaway vacation and leaving his tribe to just...deal with it?"
"I want to start by saying that I didn't have very high expectations going in to the Movie Theater, but boy was I wrong.This movie was amazing, it wasn't perfect but I feel that it delivered what it wanted to. I feel like Mr. Cameron wanted to push people to have a talk about our way of life, how we destroy our planet in the pursuit of a better life, how we are perturbing the balance of life. If we think about it, there are quite a few parallels that can be made about this movie and the way humans are destroying their one and only Planet.As for the special effects of this movie, in the last decade I was with Tony Stark on Titan when he fought Thanos, I saw the incredible visuals of Interstellar, but I really think that neither the whole MCU or any other Movie comes close to the effects of this technological marvel.When I'm thinking of the characters, there is some character development and I think that we are going to see even more of this in the future films, as the children are going to be forced to take on more and more responsibility for the well being of the Na'vi.The cinematography of this movie was impeccable, I don't think that I've seen any new ideas when coming to camera-work but every shot was good. One of the rare occasions when I'm not disposing the fact that I have to wear those 3D glasses.When it comes to the sound, it was good. Maybe I couldn't fully appreciate it because the movie Theater that I was in didn't have the latest audio system there is, but a few scenes still blew me away.As a conclusion I would recommend seeing this Movie, as it will become a piece of the cinema history and if some of those ideas that I've mentioned above can touch new people then it's a win win for everybody. I'm not going to rate it with a 10, because if I'm objective it's not a masterpiece that will change the Cinema industry, but still, it's one of those movies that will be remembered."
"7.5/10 pretty good movie, a bit better than the first Avatar imo. Just like the first one, this one also has incredible cgi, great world building and music, average plot. The characters is what separates the two, Way of Water is 50% Sully and his wife - 50% his kids, The kids' highschool drama-ish stuff kinda dragged down Act 2 a little bit (the crazy underwater cgi documentary sorta made up for it though) , but by Act 3 the kids's character growth and the family dynamics that come with them gave the movie a lot of heart and feels, a lot more so than the first movie. Even the bad sky people had a bit of character development. So all in all, weaker Act 2, but better Act 1 and much stronger Act 3.Overall I had a good time at the theater (btw like Avatar this movie really is better watched on the big screen) and I'm looking forward to seeing what comes next. I imagine Kiri and Spider will be even more important characters in the sequel and I'm all for it."
"Well it didn't disappoint, its very hard for a sequel to be as good as the first and the way of the water certainly didn't let me down. I feel it was equally as good, takes you on an emotionally and visually beautiful journey.I would recommend seeing it in 3D to get the full effect of how beautiful this movie is.Had some similarities of a story from the first one but not too similar that it lets it down, some captivating under water scenes and I love that they bring back Sigourney Weaver as she is just one of my favourite actresses of all time.No extra clips at the end so no need to stay back after the credits."
"Summary -> Incredibly stupid story. Many inconsistencies. Great effects. Disappointing.Went to watch the movie because of the first Avatar. Don't know what I was expecting, but for sure not to be bored after 20 min.The story is typical American ""Vietnam"" action movie..There is no elegance. No flow. The worst is the cliff hung at the end - leaving a possibility for another boring expensive mish - mash.On the other hand the effects are gorgeous. Strongly reminded me the ""Life of Pi"" (2012). Probably the wish to keep as much as possible of them made the movie so long.No clear message from the movie. First you play chicken and when somebody rape your daughter / kill your son you go berserk? ""The man has to protect his family"" ? What a cliché !Give it 5 stars from the greatness of my heart only for the effects. Terrible disappointment."
"This was my biggest disappointment of 2022.I went to see it out of curiosity. It has indeed beautiful shots and the universe is very realistic.But that s about it.The plot is more or less the same as Avatar 1, there were no new takes on theme like ethics, religion, ecology, place of women (like we can count on one hand the number of woman relevant to the plot, that is insane for a ""modern"" media)....It was just : action - ""oh pandora is beautiful"" - action - ""oh, pandora is beautiful"" - let s kill someone to make you cry - ""oh the 3D, oh it s blue"" - allegory that our planet is dying.I do NOT recommend it.James Cameron sure did an amazing job with the technology but a media purpose is to have an impact, like art. So, even if the way it is viewed by the world is important, the content is even more important;There was no content at all."
"There are lot of bad reviews about storyline. I find it laughable. This is not a regular sequel of a movie. This is a sequel of a decade old phenomenon.And of course it won't feel the same, but boy it has its own feeling.Trust me, this is a worthy movie to be watched in theater on a big screen with the glasses on.So much emphasis has been given on character building of the kids and coz of that there are some classic cheesey scenes. But it's all part of the narrative and nothing is off. In the end you are overwhelmed by the experience and that's what matters.Neytiri became my favourite in this movie.The message director trying to give about life in the ocean is well received.Awesome movie, it won't leave your head at least for a day!!"
"This is a movie you have to see in IMAX 3D. And at least twice. It's (positively) overwhelming and exhausting, and you will cry and laugh, but first and foremost you will be in awe when Jack and his family move to the water tribe. The combination of HFR and IMAX 3D is amazing, but some may not like it. For me the whole movie could have been in the HFR mode as the changes between regular 24fps and HFR can be seen. But it does pay off hugely in any of those spectacular scenes helping you to make out all details and enjoy the visual accomplishments. You literally feel like you are under water sometimes. Yes, it does has flaws, for some many and for others few. But, all I want to say: thank you, James Cameron and team. Thank you, you did it again and made the young boy in me feel alive again. This is the movie my wife and I will watch again in the theaters and if you ask us when we did so the last time, honestly, I can't remember, maybe Avatar 1?"
"Avatar 2 : the way of water. It is the movie 🎥 of eye fest . Watching new wonders . And the planet pandora with new avatars and new animals creatures .The graphics of this movie is next level
And this movie has the best emotions between the avatars........The Avatar part 1 already had the wrold best movie record and the highest gross among all the movies in the wrold...So now the Avatar 2 : The way of water has came hope the best ....We hope that .This movie will going to break the records of Avatar part 1 ........Try to have a theater exaprince of this movie in 3d . So that we cannot forgot the best movie experience . ... .#avatar #avatar the way of water."
"To say I was desperately shoveling coal whilst tooting the horn at the front of the hype train for this one would be an understatement. This was the cinematic event of the year for me and James Cameron has delivered some of the best sequels in filmmaking history (shut up Pirhana 2, I'm not talking about you). All the pieces were in play for the greatest sequel of all time. Unfortunately, I left the cinema feeling more like I'd just watched Alien:Resurrection, than Aliens. That might be a little harsh, but there was definitely a lot of ways this film was left me feeling flatter than if I'd just dipped a hopeful hand into a Christmas stocking, only to find a copy of GoT S8.The introduction to the movie felt extremely hurried for a 3hr+ movie, and I found myself scrambling to keep up with the fast-paced 3D action during the opening 10 minutes, whilst the expository narration got us up to speed with the Sullys new family and circumstances on Pandora.A lot of shots and scenes and dialogue from here on throughout the movie are uninspiring copy and paste retreads from the first movie, from the close ups of pupils dilating when taming Pandora's wildlife, to the obligatory 'not in Kansas anymore' and right the way down to the final shot of Jake's eyes snapping open to the glorious beat of tribal drums as the credits begin to roll.Thankfully, in between these moments were long stretches where I felt everything I wanted to feel from this sequel, so this isn't a negative review, just a slightly disappointed one. The underwater world of Pandora is like watching National Geographic pornography. It is truly awe-inspiring stuff on display here.My main issue with this sequel is that the story felt like it was a mere afterthought to the action scenes. The first story gets a lot of stick for being a 'Dances with Wolves' meets 'Pocahontas' alien lovechild, but it worked for me on a level that this sequel just doesn't. I can't help but feel that for all the stunning cinematography and visual effects, that it was extremely slim on plot and interesting dialogue.James Cameron has delivered a world that most of us would trade the Earth to live in. I really hope that we get to visit it again with more focus and attention given to riveting plot than gun battles and overlong whale-hunting scenes. My god, the whales.In short, a mixed bag which I will surely revisit with lowered expectations and hopefully enjoy more upon the second viewing."
"Yesterday we went to the movie Avatar. It was a bit disappointing. Lots of fights, water beasts and machines. The story was very thin. Why are they fighting in the first place? The theme of the first Avatar was not explored . The principle of the transmission of the personality to another body, the idea that the pearth-eople are the 'invaders' and the blue people the real inhabitants, the 3D effect through which you fly along, the idea of a conscious planet that is connected to everything, all those things were repeated but not elaborated. Or it must have been that yoga thing with which a familymember managed to connect with the deity. It was too many soldiers shouting ""go go go"". Or rather a classic western storyline, where the blue people make Indian sounds and ride large dragonflies instead of horses, the earth-people are stupid shooting savages that produce John Wayne lyrics. A lot of hassle with a sad whale, the Pandora's flipper had been disowned by his group. Lots of standard Hollywood themes: Keeping the family together. The death of a beloved but not essential helper. And the existence of a potion that is worth a lot of money and has life-saving properties. Other than that, it was too long."
"I don't even know where to begin but let it be the plot. The plot is so forced and manly uninteresting. If they just killed Jake the whole story would be over and no one would be hurt. They added the plot about the wales and how people are killing them for youth, it's the only reason they are there but really? Hm... Then there is the whole deal about the kids and the plots around them are predictable and boring. I don't even know what to say about plot wholes, they are so obvious I won't waste time writing about it.Next is the dialog. I don't get how could they made the movie and be like ""oh this is how people talk in real life"". It's all cringe, cliche, unconvincing, unrelatable. It's as if a thirteen year old has written the dialog. Disappointing, really disappointing. ""Bro"" was mentioned in a sentence so many times and I don't understand if they thought ""it's how young people talk these days"" or if they just didn't bother with the dialog.This movie lacked the point. There is no good plot, nor good, convincing villain... There wasn't any relatable, interesting character, the motives of all characters are so cliche and superficial.Visuals are great but as many have mentioned, I could have just watched National Geographic and it wouldn't be as long or boring as this movie.Overall, it has some dynamic and it is watchable. I would say it's a mediocre movie at best but that is just because I'm feeling generous. There are so many better movies to watch, you don't need to waste your time with this one, not even for the stunning VFX and good-looking scenes..."
"Builds a fantastic world that also looks great, but weakens especially at the end due to a never-ending plot. 120 minutes running time, would have made the film certainly a little rounder, but on the other hand, you just do not want to miss the wonderful underwater scenes and you are somehow happy with the end result. Even if you surely have to take a pee break in between.On a visual level and in terms of audio and atmosphere, the film is a masterpiece. Never before have alien worlds felt so alive, never before have you wanted to ""dive"" into a film so much. The film certainly lives on the effect on the big screen, only there it can really blow you away.Watch it, preferably in 3D, I promise you will enjoy it!"
"There is much to love about Avatar: The Way of Water, but there's a lot of problems that spoiled the film for me.As an audio/visual cinematic experience it's a whirlwind of impressive visuals, choreographed beautiful scenes that hit all its marks. But when the story and details are explained it's quite frankly gibberish with logic tossed over the shoulder in favor of spectacle and plot device. Why? Here come the spoilers.Years later and Jake now has a hybrid Na'vi family, two teenage boys, and young girl, and Grace's (Sigourney Weaver) adopted clone/child, which is very briefly explained but made little sense. Again a girl, but late teens (not defined).The sky people come back to Pandora; earth is dying, and they need what Pandora/Pandora has. Formally, that's the reasoning behind their invasion. They plan to squash the Na'vi and take what they need, only Jake is still the Na'vi leader, and they coordinate planned attacks to thwart the Sky people's progress. This goes on for an extended undefined period.The sky people have also brought with them a Na'vi small clone marine-squad with the memories (and training) of the last squad that were already dispatched in the last film by Jake and his indigenous uprising, including Colonel Miles Quartich. They plan to use this squad and any assets available to capture/assassinate Jake as he's now a royal pain in the behind. Jakes children are the first to run into this squad of clones, and are captured by them shortly after radioing Jake to let him know. After a scuffle Jake and his mate 'Neytiri' (Zoe Saldana) rescue their children but are spooked enough to leave their current forest tribe because they present a risk and will always draw danger from the colonel, his squad, and ultimately the sky people.Problem 1; how do the sky people know Jake's done a runner? Does this stop the humans from attacking the Na'vi and taking what they want?So, Jake plans his families escape and they embark upon a long journey to take refuge with a water tribe on one island amongst many. They will blend in, disappear amongst other Na'vi.Whilst they're there they're forced to earn their keep and be useful, they learn to bond with water creatures and also are taught how to spend extended periods of time under water. It's never defined exactly how long, but the impression is, at a guess; 10 minutes or more.*A BUNCH OF STUFF HAPPENS AND IT ALL LOOKS VERY IMPRESSIVE*Problem 2: Skip to the end, there's a sinking ship, Jake and his family are 'trapped' and suddenly the weeks/months of training where being under water wasn't an issue is now an issue. They're going to drown but of course are saved in the nick of time. Logic is out of the window and all the amazing underwater scenes, the preamble about adapting and fitting in now means very little because the film needed some danger; a plot device to give us an exciting cliff hanger, and drowning was the danger they chose, the one thing that made no sense.Problem 3; why on earth is the Colonel given carte blanche to chase Jake across the continent just to murder him? If he's no longer leading the Na'vi so what's the point? It's completely mindless revenge and utter nonsense, with humans, their equipment, the Na'vi, and the wildlife all dispensable for the sake of killing a single tall blue dude who already gave up and ran away.Now I think its perfectly fine for someone else to watch this film and not care about these problems, but for me it pulverized my suspension of disbelief. I just sat thinking.... why, instead of watching the film. Its very clear some extremely talented people were involved amongst the cast and crew, but where it counted most; the writing is where the time/talent/patience ran dry."
"The movie and characters look so real looking and the story was well thought out. The CGI was not as obvious compare to the first movie, the creativity was out this world and loved how the main character family played a big part together. It was not childish screen play or corny, the boats and excoskeleton was on point. The evolution concept of the avatar was cool because showing the expected size difference between being in water and out of water avatar developments of the anatomy. The hybrid aspect was a good ideal to show human and s different being would be together. Overall highly recommend watching this movie!"
"Released more than a decade after its first installment, this awe inspiring visual delight is truly worth waiting for! Revolving around the Sully family, and their struggle against the ""sky people,"" it never stops to surprise its audience with almost believable visual effects. Now, sometimes over the duration of the movie, you may feel that a three hour stretch is a technology overkill, and that it's too much ""family,"" but if you're solely going out with the objective of a visual spectacle, you won't be disappointed. The plot, though not the best it could've been (sloppy at times), works out pretty well as a whole.The first Avatar was a revolution, and hence, any comparison between the two is unfair. Individually, the second part surely is an amusement. As such, if you're up for an impactful fantasy experience, be sure to watch it!"
"I saw this tonight and it was an emotional journey I did not expect. Wow, thank to all who made this happen. It is almost like this film is predicting our future but also describing our past. It sounds crazy but I loved every scene.The acting, writing, effects, directing and everything was perfect to me. Thank you to Mr Cameron and all. If this film doesn't win best picture at the next Oscars, then I don't know what else possibley could.I watched the film in 3D super screen which made the experience even greater.Wow it is a mission to post a review about a film I enjoyed. This is the first one I've done and I have nothing bad to say about the movie.Thank you and I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did."
"I think this movie was made to market a video game. The fight scenes felt like I was in one. I didn't love this like I did the first one. Story was ok. Visuals were stunning. But the fight stuff was too much and a little unbelievable. Humans are very resilient in this. Middle aged guy in boat gets thrown in the air and crashe into it but can still run and fight. Dissapointed Overall
I liked the strong female characters. I like the fact that even while pregnant they continue to hunt and fight I was confused by monkey boys attachment to his dad and why looking at the way that his stepmom's facelift when she killed his dad and went to kill his dad again like triggered things for him, I could see they were trying to show that he could see they were animals or something but it just didn't ring true. They also were awfully prolific and there were some breaks in Continuity that didn't make sense to me the way that they sometimes lost track of people, etc. I don't know it just was missing something."
"Yah, this is a mokka film. Time waste; There is no word to say more. The story of the story, the ridiculous screenplay, the useless characters, the unnecessary verses, the rich film. To say the item, there is no onion in this picture. If you want to enjoy the deep sea, go to the David Attennberg videos on the TV. The film is a boring picture that keeps the viewers sleeping. In the name of magnitude, do not make money and time. There is no need to recommend for the director of James Cameron. This is a trash like the usual Hollywood garbage picture. If you want to see the wonderful graphic scenes, the PS-4 is better than the graphic scenes of the film."
"Cameron invites us once again to travel in an other world. Even though the plot may be considered as basic, the character development and the world building are amazing, along with the visuals that are truly outstanding (they have outdone themselves!). The amount of details and work put in every shot of this movie is incredible. The underwater sequences are wonderful and I've never seen such actions scene (especially in the third act). Every actors deliver a heartbreaking performance (I cried many times during the 3 hours that did not feel like 3 hours at all). James Cameron has done it again lads!"
"This movie was visually stunning, the music was incredible, the story was good and so too was the acting. I really don't understand what the critics who are putting this movie down are on about - the experience was true escapism and you can see how and where James Cameron spent his billions in production as each and every scene was flawless with great attention to detail. This is one of those movies you have to see on a giant screen, ideally IMAX and 3D. Like the firsts movie this one is likely to appeal to a global audience and it has a general moral storyline that makes it a family movie. Definitely recommended!"
"I'm really confused as to why people don't score this movie higher. It didn't feel disconnected from the first film, it had new and old characters, the new exploration of the sea to me was a great match to the forest we already know. Yeah it's long but that shouldn't discredit the movie itself. My love for Avatar as far as I'm concerned has been reignited. This film brought me back to why I enjoyed the first one so much but it also added more development of characters and storyline. One thing I felt conflicted by was Neytiri not trusting or liking Spider, especially since her husband was human once and for the fact that humans still live on Pandora. Maybe another small thing here or there that felt off or I thought could have been different but overall I truly was entertained and enjoyed it. I'm excited to see how this story will continu..."
"First let me talk about the best part of the movie, the incredible visuals presented. They presented a couple different settings, with them portraying all the wildlife, characters, and scenery with great artistically wonder. You feel like you can jump right into the world and explore for decades without loss of thrill.Secondly, I will talk about the basic and people pleasing story designed to surround the audience in the world's visual flare as much as possible. I never watched the first avatar movie so I cant really speak about what happened beforehand, the story in avatar 2 starts with the main character, playing with his 4 children. The children are one boy, two girls, and one human. It starts by humans going to the island that the people have been living at with a grandiose entrance, destroying all the wildlife, trees, and plants around the forest in a devastating scene. You quickly learn in the story that humans bad while the aliens good and is a wild goose chase between the two major characters which are Jake Sully and the Colonel, which I assume are the previous film's protagonists. The ending of the film leaves it at a cliffhanger in which the Colonel's previous son before he became an Avatar, saves his life with absolutely no gain for himself even after he killed the eldest son of Jake's family. The story overall felt very empty and didn't feel that the movie need to be 3 hours long especially in scenes that include the main characters just walking around pointlessly to show off the great visuals, but do nothing for the story. The ending was very irritating looking at the Colonel's son (who he abandoned) saves him from a drowning ship for no benefit for himself after the fact that the colonel killed the eldest son from Jake's family.Lastly, I want to talk about the characters in the story and how they all seem emotionless. None of the alien characters are actually likable in the story because all they do is killing, make yelling noises, or bully the opposite race. The people in the story that have emotions are the three main characters which are Jake, Jakes wife, and the Colonel. Jake wants to enjoy a peaceful life with his family, but he cant with humans coming in to invaded and pillage the alien race which deepens the conflict. Jakes wife just shows two emotions through the film, sadness and anger which gets kind of annoying, but I have no idea how she acted in the first film so I cant really judge too harshly. The Colonel feels the most emotions that all the characters which shouldn't be a good thing for the audience to enjoy watching a man's struggles in killing an peaceful alien race. My favorite character in the story is the colonel, they go into his life, goals, and occupation in depth which really do make you sympathetic for the antagonist in the story."
"If you go to see this movie, make sure you do so in 3D which is how it's intended to be seen. This is the best film I've ever watched due to the 3D which really makes the world come alive. Despite a 190 minute run time, I could've sat there for longer due to being so immersed. It was really apparent that the actors felt so comfortable in the water, which made the overall acting and storyline feel so realistic.The story may now blow you away, however with three more movies upcoming which will all tie in together, there's enough there this time around to be enjoyed and excite on what's to come."
"James Cameron's turn-of-the-decade sequel, based on the 2009 box office record-setting blue world of Pandora is technically tantamount to an absolute masterstroke - and nothing less. Inspired by the perceptive experiences of the visionary filmmaker, ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" serves up extraordinary 3D features unlike any before, and just like in the original, Cameron deeply utilizes advanced technology to create some stunning high frame rate pictures, that puts out a new feat of visual stimu Avatar"" and the planet of Pandora. Both loyal fans and regu bro besti movi i love this movi lov it th."
"Today was that day. I went to cinema to watch the long-expected movie by famous director James Cameron.As resposible viewer, this week I rewarched Avatar 1 to refresh my memories about that film. I was again surprised how good Avatar 1 is, not just CGI (compared to the year of premiere), but also the story.I had high expectations for the sequel. But after 3 hours long journey in Pandora, i became tired and disappointed. At first it is important to say they spent 10 years on making Avatar: The way of water. Lets talk about aspects of the movie.CGI was great again. Avatar 2 has many beautiful scenes, visual of Avatar got also better. On the other hand, in the second half, there were some scenes, that weren't even mid. I mean the scene with broking the hand and others. They just didn't feel real enough.Story was the weakest point of this movie. All in all, the story was totally similar to story from 1st movie. I think Cameron focus was on CGI and he thinks that good CGI will take people to cinemas. If you ask people why they liked the movie, 90% percent of them will say CGI/visual...etc. The movie with this budget should have good story. I think hype was big, but I think when they won't make big changes to plot in the third movie, it will be flop.We dont need movie that just look good."
"The film is limited by its runtime, not its story, as many critics have falsely attributed as its main problem. The story should be wonderful. It just feels rushed and way too fast paced in every single scene. Not to mention, there are too many characters to follow now and jarring cuts between perspectives distract further from the story.There are multiple examples of great scenes that were likely ruined by the editing alone. The killing of the whale is the most coherent scene after what feels like hours of a fastforwards, but it ends with an awkward interjection of the first Avatar's hometree falling soundtrack, and the scene halts a bit too suddenly to have enough of an emotional impact. In another scene, Kiri has a seizure for connecting with the underwater tree, and we are warned of the consequences should she repeat her actions, but later she does it in one shot with no warning and without consequences during the final battle, in a moment which feels totally unearned. When Lo'ak's whale friend emerges to save Jake Sully before he surrenders himself, the editing is so awkward that all impact and sense of epicness is lost. The whale comes in too suddenly and without much prompt and we lose focus on Jake.The sequel completely lacks the soul and magic of the first film, even if the editing was better, which I suspect resulted from having to cut down a lot of footage. Another problem is having too many characters to follow, which often produces jarring cuts. In the first film, the climax felt so epic, and I still vividly remember many shots like the Na'vi jumping on those flying dragons mid air and Quaritch drinking his coffee while bombing the home tree. There is room to breathe and linger. When Jake's eldest sun dies under nightfall, it should have been impactful, but there are too many cuts and there is not enough room to linger on the death. They should have delayed this into 2023 to make a more coherent edit. The final battle between Quaritch and Jake and Neytiri was so epic in the first film because there was astute focus on only Jake and Neytiri. In the second film, we follow so many characters that the jarring editing removes all sense of thrill. Even if it was better edited, the entire climax takes place in a rather boring industrial ship, underwater, and the fight between Jake and Quaritch seems to end in a minute.Cameron, I held as the last great pure auteur of cinema, who would redeem the fading art now stuck in the dark ages, but he has retreated to the all-too familiar bland faded scenery, fast forward storytelling, and most of all a lack of a soul. I believe even if the film was better edited it would still lack the soul the first film had. I suspect many people who 'loved' this sequel simply wanted to believe that modern cinema of the 20s still has that 'movie magic', and Cameron was their last hope because he at least hints at this. But we need to accept that this film is a disappointment inherent to this era of cinema. This just goes to show that nobody at the top of the artists currently has the answers to save us, we have to rely on the next generation now. Instead of praising or critiquing this film, go make a film yourself. If I had the chance to produce an epic on this scale, I would never make it so dull and soulless."
"The CGI was unbelievable! It didn't seem like it was a movie and everything felt real. There were ships that seemed better than even the ones in Star Wars. However, the storyline. It has a great story and amazing character development. However, I wish there were more battles. The movie didn't seem long at all. Also, there were quite a lot of plot twists. In my opinion, this movie is way better than the first and it is an absolute masterpiece without a doubt. I didn't watch it in 3D or 4DX or any kind of experience improving place. I still enjoyed it a lot. There isn't a post credit scene which is very disappointing but it is fine considering the actual movie's runtime."
"I'm honestly very disappointed with Avatar 2, the storyline is a mess and I don't know where to take it. I just enjoy the CGI that seems real by taking 3D. However, 3 hours 12 minutes in the cinema it makes me dizzy plus the conflicts are messy and too forced I don't enjoy the film, it makes me nauseous and dizzy because I wear 3D glasses for a long time but it's presented a messy film that wins CGI, I don't even think Avatar 3 can experience other symptoms except Avatar 3 can be improved starting from the story, the conflict is not just CGI watch at a price that is quite expensive for a film this messyCan I return my money?Rate: 6/10 (the 6 is only for cgi for story -6)"
"The Movie was great. Awesome visuels the story was fine (not as good as the first one tho) bringing new kind of culture like the watertribe was also refreshing.The one reason for me that I can not give it higher than a 8 is because of the ending.SPOILERS!At the end Kolonel still lives, like why tho. Sully chokes him. Sully lost his kid because of the guy and he doesn't choke him to death, are you kidding me?Thans spider helps him but after that runs away angree at him, like why save him?This doesn't not make sense to me and I hope that the third movie wil have a different story/villian. Because war with kolonel again would be lame in my opinion.But except for that, awesome movie would wath it again en reccomend! 8 it is."
"The sequel of the sci-fi epic ""Avatar"" might be belated, but it was definitely worth the wait! It's totally breathtaking (especially if it's experienced on 3D Dolby Atmos), enjoyable, not at all tiring despite its long runtime and with a powerful message about the destruction of the environment by people, that don't learn by their mistakes (the mass destruction they caused on Earth). It is also solid proof that James Cameron hasn't lost his ability on making blockbuster films, and that is certainly a must-see blockbuster that undoubtedly it's worth the money! The characters, especially the children of Jake and Neytiri, are well-written, even though some changes and other characters remain relatively unexplored. On the downside, the script may not be the most original and the word ""bro"" is heard so many times that it will get on your nerves after a while, but these ""flaws"" can be easily forgiven in that absolutely thrilling movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat! I have no more to say, just see the movie on the big screen and be sure that you will get your money's worth! I have no doubt that it will win the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects!"
"Avatar: The Way of Water is a stunning visual spectacle. The graphic CGI is nothing short of amazing, bringing to life a world that is both beautiful and awe-inspiring. The level of detail in the animation is truly remarkable and will leave you feeling as though you have been transported to another world.The visual effects are equally impressive, with vibrant colors and incredible attention to detail. From the lush plant life to the intricate details of the creatures that inhabit this world, Avatar: The Way of Water is a true feast for the eyes.While the plot may not be groundbreaking, it is still entertaining and enjoyable. The story follows the same themes as the original Avatar film, with a focus on environmentalism and the importance of living in harmony with nature.Overall, highly recommend watching in IMAX 3D. The film is a visual masterpiece, and the 3D technology adds an extra layer of immersion that makes the experience truly unforgettable."
"The plot is scripted perfectly and worth watching.-the graphic is magnificent and the texture of the water and other elements is using a real physic and texture and close to real life but the scene about the village is kinda canny and cartoonish .basically, the CGI is well made just a little careless in some sort.-its a love story but it's more to family kinda thing you know.the dad and son kinda thing or brotherhood's in some part. They are also using a foreign language.-emotion and feelings in this movie successfully breaks and take in to the heart in the people watching-this movie has a slow pace and for 3 hours I think it's too long.you can sleep in the Cinema and missing the important part.but to my personal opinion i dindnt feel the length-i think the cast has acted very well and successfully feel and master the character-a pinch of comedy is added to quench your boring along this movie-they make this movie is going to game award or something idk because of the graphics and camera angle but of course not playable and cut scene all along-i personally recommend this movie to people who is enjoying the movie and not in a heck of a rush or just admire the storyline and beautiful graphic texture and don't worry it's better than the first movie.-the ending is a unique way to finish a movie and I looking forward for another sequel.Rating:
Plot 8/10
Graphics 9/10
Actor(character) 7/10OVERALL RATING:
8.5 / 10."
Visually very stunning The world building amazing. The family dynamic throughout the entire movie was amazing.The only thing that bothered me about Avatar is the human saying that they need to go to that planet because the Earth is dying. So they want to colonize that planet which makes zero sense considering that planet doesn't have the atmosphere humans need to survive. When in our own solar system there is already at least one option. It would have been way more enjoyable for me if it was over the precious resources again. Would have been more realistic for a movie about big blue space aliens.
"I was worried going into a 3 hour movie, at 10pm that I would fall asleep. This wasn't the case, as soon as the movie started I was involved. The special effects and visuals are breath taking, and the store pulls you in. Seeing it on the big screen it really felt like I was inside the movie. The coral reefs were stunning, the sea life was beautiful. There was one scene in particular though where I kept my eyes closed, and I cried like a baby, a long with many other audience members. If it had gone on any longer I fear I would have walked out. A movie hasn't brought out so many emotions in me, in a long time. I'm glad I stayed till the end. It was so worth it."
"As a movie is not Good , As a movie experience it's good. Avatar: The Way of Water review: Stunning Sequel.My rating: 4/5 Performances:James Cameron is known for getting the optimum out of his cast and crew. All the actors came up with brilliant performances. Jakes Sully standout by showing variations in expressions and emotions. He maintained the same intensity to make an impact. Zoe Saldana, Clif Curtiss, and Kate Winslet blended with him to elevate the scenes with their performances. The actors who played the roles of their children brought in good emotions to complete the story.Technical values:Technically, Avatar-The Way of Water is outstanding. Right fromVFX to graphics work everything looks captivating. The 3D effects are stunning and they are not just for the sack of publicity. Each 3D shot has proper research and reason. The Pandora world created is just amazing and is presentedsuperbly deep underwater. Technical brilliance is visible in each andevery shot throughout the film.The background score composed by Simon Franglen is arresting and elevates the mood of the film nicely. The photography work by Russell Carpenter is nice. His work registers despite the film having more graphics.The collective editing work done by Stephen E. Rivkin, DavidBrenner, John Refoua and James Cameron is effective. The production design is stunning and so is the case with the production values Lightstorm Entertainment and TSG Entertainment. For the audience who are watching the Telugu version, the Telugu dialogues written by Srinivas Avasarala elevate the emotional depth of the film decently.The second installment from the creative genius JamesCameron's cinematic universe, Avatar has high making standards.Alongside the magical setup and fictional premise created, Avatar- The Way of Water addresses elements like social equality, civilization and takes a strong anti-military stand."
"Avatar: The Way of Water is a film that truly delivers on all fronts. From the stunning visuals and world-building, to the captivating story and fully fleshed out characters, this film has it all. The action scenes are intense and the emotional moments pack a powerful punch, making for a truly unforgettable cinematic experience.The 3D effects in this film are some of the best I've ever seen, really adding to the overall immersion in the world of Pandora. The music and soundtrack are equally impressive, adding depth and emotion to the film.Overall, I would give Avatar: The Way of Water a solid 9 out of 10. It is a must-see for any fan of the Avatar franchise or anyone looking for a top-notch cinematic experience. Do not miss out on this one!"
"I loved this movie just as much as I loved the original! I will be there for however many more sequels are released. The visuals are absolutely stunning! And that is what originally had me intrigued. I truly feel that I'm apart of the world of Pandora when watching. While I do feel that that the story line is just a tad lacking I do feel there is enough character/world building and depth to really make me feel for the characters and the world they live in. While I was originally drawn in for the beauty of the world it didn't take long to find myself falling for the characters and the universe that brought them forth. Watching these movies, and even more so for The Way of Water, I find myself so drawn in that I'm despising certain characters, cheering for others and mourning for the losses that they experienced. I simply can't get enough of."
"I'm a 3d fan, and watched the first Avatar in 3d and quite liked the film, but never watched it again. This film benefits so much from 3d, especially the underwater sequences. And there are a lot. I was not so keen on the fighting bits, where, a bit like the stormtroopers in star wars, you know the antagonists are cannon fodder. However the story of the family adapting to another tribes lifestyle, and the interactions, were very great. My wife hates action films and 3d but loved this, and my son does not care much for films about relationships, but also loved this, so there is something for most film goers here. We didn't think we would last the full film as it was quite long, but there's enough here to keep ones attention."
Avatar 2 to perfect carry forward of the same spice and emotion from the previous flick...and it successfully moved everyone with yet the glorious writing and filming.Even for a movie releasing after 15 years it enhances the visual Charisma of the movie yet holding on to the relevances to Pandora and the characters.Here the movie movies a step ahead to a family from Jake sully and neytiri..and a step ahead from a forest clan to beyond the seas.The movie's technicalities are simply magnificent...the writing and the cinematography requires an applause.Finally James Cameron isn't just a filmaker he is a creator of worlds.💙🛐
"There were plenty of interesting plot points in the movie, like having a military leader as a father who struggles to switch from commander to father and remember his role to nurture his children. There is the idea of war and self defense vs peace, where Cameron explores the idea of never responding to violence vs fighting for your people. There is the environmental greed from the sky people vs the native harmony with nature, which was a driving theme in the first movie as well. Another plot is that of feeling othered for the children of Jake Sully, as not being fully Na'vi. But sometimes when so many plot lines are present it makes the runtime long and doesn't allow adequate build up to see these plot points develop to their full potential. I wish more time was given to the realities of prolonged war against colonizers. Sully should have interacted more with various clan chiefs or war leaders within his own tribe to show even though they are fighting against the sky people the sky people still are coming building and settling on their planet. This should have been interposed with how he treats his family and the expectations for his sons.Another problem that took me out of the movie were the scenes with Kiri. You have a girl with the voice of an older women. It removes the child like innocence that Kiri should have. Any scene where she cries or calls for mom and dad seem fake and inauthentic. I would have rather had a young actress portray Kiri, keeping her same features."
"Like many people have said, this show has 3 different stories rolled into one. The decision making by the main characters doesn't hold true to the way they acted in the first movie. There is also a huge disconnect from the first movie and this one.I also found the ""coming of age"" saga in the middle of the movie really odd. It made it seem like a childrens disney movie without anything really entertaining going on. The action scenes afterwards is what really saved the movie from being a sub-5 score movie. Overall the movie is watchable for those who enjoy new and outlanding worlds, I just wish they would have written a good and not safe story to go along side it."
"""Water connects all things, life thru death, and darkness thru light!""Prologue:Aaah, these mobile phones! Have you ever wondered ever since these mobiles came into our hands, our attention span has been reduced to that of a kitten or an infant? We stopped paying attention to everything and we became ever-busy, doing nothing - or gazing at the gadget, doing nothing! When was the last time you ""lived"" at the moment? I saw some folks trying to capture the visual grandeur happening on the screen on their 6-inch cell phones rather than enjoying the awe in front of their eyes! So, if you don't have time for this 192-minute visual wonder, you better stay off!*Watching Avatar: The Way of Water is like going for meditation! Only if you indulge all your senses in it, you can enjoy the ecstasy it creates for you. You will be spellbound by James Cameron's visual wizardry - be it the fluorescent bodies of the natives of Pandora, the beautiful terrestrial creatures as well as underwater giants, and the machines, guns, and ships the humans use to hunt Na'vi race - every frame in the movie will make your jaw drop in awe and amazement.The Way of Water picks up a decade after the events of Avatar. Jake and Neytiri are now proud parents of 5 children - 3 biological and 2 adopted. Of the two adopted children, one girl Kiri was born from doctor Grace Augustine's avatar. (Sigourney Weaver must be really happy to see herself younger in the role of Kiri.) The other boy is the son of Miles Quaritch who was killed by Jack in the first part. All 5 children, despite their physical differences, mingle well and they all live happily for a moment until a star appears in the sky! The star is nothing but a group of spaceships carrying humans to colonize Pandora planet for its rich source of minerals. Colonel Miles Quaritch, who was killed by Jack Sully returns as a clone in his Avatar body with his memories embedded. He wants to take revenge on Jack Sully. How Jack Sully faces his archenemy and protects his family forms the crux of the story.Have you ever thought that the other species with whom we live in this world try to communicate with us? If only we care to listen to them! Apart from the family theme the movie explores, it is also about how we should co-exist with other creatures on the planet and care to listen to what they're trying to communicate. There's a beautiful bonding episode of a sea creature called Payakan and the son of Jake. All the people on Na'vi co-exist with their surroundings and creatures that live amongst them. They even consider other species as their spiritual family and address them as their sisters and brothers.Epilogue:Avatar: The Way of Water doesn't offer you an adrenaline rush or the edge-of-the-seat experience. Instead, it gives you an overwhelming feeling of awe and admiration which will stay with you for some time. My suggestion is, if you have access to an IMAX screening, go for it. The gigantic scale on which the film is made is to be enjoyed on IMAX screens only! If it is not possible, well, better enjoy it in 3D. But whichever way you watch it, indulge in it, and you will enjoy it absolutely! Don't worry if all the Na'vi people look the same with fluorescent blue shades. I couldn't recognize Kate Winslet as Ronal! All things will fall into place and you will understand once you enter the Pandora world leaving everything, especially your cell phones, behind and the length of the film doesn't bother you!And yeah! Avatar 3 is due in the month of December 2024, which is two years from now!"
"Good things: Wonderful graphic, everything is just beautiful. All the movements, lightings,... It's like a dinner for your eyes. I highly recommend that you see it in 3D to maximize the effects. Take your time to enjoy all the details. Don't rush. Sometimes you just need to put the story aside, enjoy, and then continue the main story.Drawbacks: The story is ok. It's not bad though but not great. It's interesting but lack of novelty. It's not super convincing though. Sometimes you may wonder why the character do that while he still have other choices. But it's still good compared to super hero movies.Anyway I would love to see the next parts."
"Sometimes what we all need is a break from the actual world. Avatar: Way of water is the break that everyone needed in their lives.The story is simple, family based and reminds us what it was to pack good character development with a easy to the mind story. The first hour is just a visual Spectacle wherein you can enjoy Pandora and the visual effects. The last hour will be gone in a second. It is just amazing how the story starts slowly and then escalates to the climax where you don't realise how fast the time has passed. It is a must watch for people who loved family movies from the 2000s. Visual Spectacle is a bonus."
"Avatar 2 will have a spectacular game for sure, I'm not sure if I paid to watch a movie or a game ad.The 5(!) kids particularly stereotyped, we hardly know anything about the eldest after 3 h of playtime. There are more holes in the plot that are in my tea pasoir.As an exact scientist, I take offense with the standing boulders, and I am pretty sure that are not allowed in any descent gravity theory. Although Weaver was a plus in Avatar 1, her dialog in 1 is mambo jumbo pseudoscientific talk. Someone must give an Oscar to Kip Thorn for his help with Interstelar. That brings me to the last point: soundtrack , did I mention Interstelar already? Enough said.Avatar 3+ I will enjoy on my couch. I regret exposing myself to the ( even minimal now 12-2022) risk of getting COVID-19 AND the 7$ I payed (with special pass). DVD is fine.Cameron let us down. Don't reward him for that."
"This movie was a joy to watch. I loved every possible second of it. Sure, the story was partially predictable, but that doesn't stop this movie from, in my opinion, becoming the best of the decade. The cast returns in astonishing fashion along with some new characters! Sure, some of them are jerks, but some of them can be extremely likable. The character development as well is incredible, especially for some of our new protagonists. And don't get me started on the visual effects oh, my God, they are INCREDIBLE!! All of this adds up to it being, again, in my opinion, superior to its predecessor. Yes, it is three hours long, which is pretty dang long for a sequel, but this is still worth the watch. Buy a ticket, go to a theater, and watch this on the big screen. You will NOT be disappointed. GO, JAMES CAMERON!!"
"1. No Story at all.2. Lact the goal.3. Caotic action scenes.4. Better to go see an aquarium than this movie or do boating or scuba if at all we have to watch see animals this movie shows and these movie people enjoy doing fun in water.5. Now i know why they delayed this sequel so long almost 14 years coz they didn't had any story at all to continue and plus they can't make up a proper one even in these 14 years
6. US Army Navy drama vs some alien soups already got bored with so many already out there. Enough please !!!!7. First part they were after ultranium, second part after whale fluid, now third part some other stuff...Boring !!!8. Atleast 14 years ago first part was fun coz it was wonder to see those scenematic creatures during that time but now even after 14 years he is trying to show the same thing no timely updates and upgrades.9. Spoiler alert: Waste of Time Plus Bad mood after wattching this movie.. Spending almost 4hours with theater ads and drink break10. In Conclusion: I wasted my time, money and damage my mood. You please Don't."
"Pointless overkill in violence for what could easily have remained a family film without it. Insulting trope of women being emotional and needing aloof men to calm them down. Death of child/sibling trivialized in the face of entire theme of family sticking together. The majesty and beauty of the film is wasted on graphic violence and threats and mutilation and graphic kills. Glad they fired Disney CEO over this film.Lazy filmmaking if all you can devise is graphic killing. Imagine Harry Potter with machine guns, or any other fantasy film. Even star wars is visually striking without resorting to hardcore violence. He's trashed this sequel. Hope he won't make more."
"James cameron has done it again!!! He took every flaw from the first avatar and perfected it so amazingly. From the CGI, beautiful shots, emotion, action, there was no flaws in this movie for me.The bonds between the native animals are just so well thought out. The coastal landscapes are absolutely stunning and enriched with ancient culture. The background music was spot on even after horners sad passing. They were just so clever on how they constructed this film.The beginning of the film was set up so perfectly and viewers don't really need to watch the first film to have an idea. The movie was so perfectly paced and so well set up."
"James Cameron has finally released a sequel to his sci-fi epic 'Avatar' and, after a 13 year long wait, it surpasses all expectations. Through stunning visuals, we are once again absorbed into the mesmerising world of Pandora, this time exploring its oceans and the unearthly creatures that inhabit them. It's a truly beautiful experience to see on a big screen, with not one shot being uninteresting to look at, which makes the runtime of over 3 hours completely acceptable. Even with multiple rewatches there will always be something new to see.Though the visuals have definitely dialled up for 'Avatar: The Way of Water', the film has a much simpler plot compared to that of its predecessor. But it is nevertheless compelling and ends with highly entertaining and extensive action sequences that bear, resemblance to another James Cameron blockbuster, 'Titanic'. There's also the return of some great characters who are deepened throughout as well as the introduction of new, interesting ones, both of which create questions that we can hope to see answered in future installations.For more reviews check out our instagram: film.follower."
"I saw the imax version yesterday. And I love the new Avatar movie!Absolutely stunning cgi, okay plot, limited character development. Overall I love it! Worth the IMAX ticket and worth 3 hours of my time! Absolutely entertaining!!!!! Absolutely fun!!!!!Just a heads up it's more Marvel than a lot of the Marvel movies, which is interesting because I thought the director isn't overly fond of Marvel movies. Not sure what changed his mind.And it doesn't feel like a new movie in terms of plots. The plots feels like a lot of ctrl-C ctrl-V from other movies or even the director's previous movies such as Titanic.It reminds me of the time when Mozart was asked to compose a flute concerto. And he literally copied every single note from his clarinet concerto and converted the clarinet part to flute. Good artists borrow, great artists steal, and sometimes even from masterpieces by themselves.James Cameron is a director I like and respect. I myself is a Marvel fan but I agree with his criticism on Marvel. Marvel need to get better at telling stories and focus on character growth rather than just focusing on big scenes. Which is why even though I love this new Avatar movie (and probably would see it again). I feel like giving it anything above 7 stars would be extremely disrespectful for Cameron's own words given how much he disapproves the Marvel storytelling way.It is fun! Definitely would recommend. As a good entertainment."
"This movie was worth the wait! I just hope we don't have to wait long for the 3rd one. So much has happened but the story line was outstanding and the passion, hurt and beautiful scenes were to die for. I've been watching the first over and over after all these years now I have a second one to watch over and over lol. James Cameron out did himself again! I can't wait to see the next adventure on pandora and everything was making sense. But they are some things that I need answers too also. Like how did the general have a kid and with whooo and why did his son save him if Jake is his father now. That's made me so mad but at the same time he doesn't know any better. Can't wait to see what happens next."
"Yes the story is old but I think it is time we are reminded of real values. I watched on the 4dmax and I tell you that you quickly get lost of the pure genius of Jim. And I will put money on it that Martin S will agree that was spectacle. Can't wait to see it again as so much happened. Totally lost and to a surprise the acting is way beter that the usual big buster movies. It is a definitely a movie to watch a few times, however some people just don't see the point of calling it a movie as it is more of a joy ride. And I get that however no other special effects movie comes close, try and enjoy the journey not to end or beginigP. S. Still 3 to come can't wait."
"The movie was great in the cinema. 3d and dolby atmos are the best things about this extreemly long movie. The story is a bit thin, with some loose ends, who's your daddy?Avatar 1 was great with 3d effects in a forrest. In this movie they wanted a different background so water. Whats next? Vulcano? Micro avatars?When going to the cinema take the front row, you will feel being 'in' the 3d movie.This is a movie that will not work on a home screen unless you have a large house and a ditto screen and most of all no neighbors.Go to the cinema and be amazed. But first visit the toilet if there is no film break.Don't download this movie illegally, its like finally owning a Ferrari but only being able to drive it in a parking lot. Go to the cinema and be amazed."
"On a technical level, magnificent. This is some of the best CGI I've ever seen, the ocean looks amazing and characters never look out of place. In terms or characters, for the most part it's great, though I feel with so many, some of the development felt very thin despite the 3 hours we spend with these characters. Everyone gave amazing performances in the film. The story was interesting though it was stretched way longer than it needed to be, with large portions of the film just showing off the beauty of the world but not servicing the story in anyway necessary. Overall an entertaining but overlong film."
"Between all the science fiction elements and actions scenes, Avatar the way of water is mainly about relationship between father and son, mother and daughter, siblings rivalry. Don't get me wrong, it has breathe taking action scenes that you cannot take your eyes of the screen but that's typical for James Cameron. It is full of surprises for everyone. The surprise of villain redemed once he realizes that his world is not all black and white, but let's say more full of different shades of grey, or in this case blue. That is a line from the movie, why so blue? Overall, it picks immediately after the first Avatar where you left Jake Sully."
This was truly a masterpiece. It EXCEEDED my already high expectations. Visually stunning and captivating. I highly recommend to watch in IMAX 3D as it makes the experience even more memorable. The plot was great and very emotional at times. I think this movie is made for anyone and has a great overall message about nature and family. The reviews giving it a low rating are trolls. I have nothing bad to say about the movie at all. The 3 hour run time felt like an hour when lost in the wonderful world of Pandora. I will definitely be going back to see it a couple times. One of the most unique films I've seen since the original.
"Absolutely stunning and beautiful. After 13 years from Avatar 1, I had an opportunity to watch this movie yesterday in VietNam. I just wanna say this movie is extremely interesting. Although this movie is 3 hours long, I didn't feel sleepy or bored at all. The story of the film is also very meaningful, promoting family affection and especially the role of the father in the family. I will watch this movie again and recommend to my friends. Honestly, the director and actors as well as the technical department did a very good job, I strongly believe this movie will be the best movie of 2022. Best movie ever."
"I am sure now, there is planet, where I will find same people. Reason. We only create things thats exits and I am sure the inspiration of avatar is coming from somewhere or some energy. May be 100, 500 or 10,000 years later. But we will move there. Thanks Sir. Cameron. You are a amazing team. I am waiting for Alita's 2nd part. That movie is just amazing.The message of family is this movie so strong. I don't think so any age group don't understand or like this movie. It is a complete movie. Connection, relation and feeling. The storyline may be look similar but this should be the 2nd part to complete the last part."
"Start from go, you get to see some amazing graphic extension of the animals what the generation is aware of / seen. However, there is a the old way of characterising each character. How 1 of them is misunderstood & termed as an outlaw. How a character is always believed to be a trouble maker.The ultimate message, human beings greediness is leading to the climate change & destroying his own habitat may not be understood by all.As the story progresses, the story line is predictable. 1 blaring miss out is in the climax. The family is left to sort themselves out with the villain, the water friend & his army go missing completely."
"Every visual in this movie is made real. In my opinion this movie is the boss of all sci-fi movies. James Cameron is the most powerful movie maker in the world. Watching this movie, I also got into the story of this movie. Avatar's first episode was just as exciting. This episode is so exciting. I wish good health to James Cameron sir, and I pray to God that he can make more good movies. In this movie, the visual effects have been shown in a very beautiful way. Its vfx is extremely good. It seems the story is not over yet. More stories remain. Hopefully we will see the third part in the future."
"The second movie was equal as the first oneI really enjoyed the fact we show the members of the family
Despite the fact that this Is movie with a happy ending they are also deaths casualties which makes it more realistic .Native Americans vs Americans-Humans vs Allies we so familiar with these stories
This movie is showing us how cruel humans can be and that can destroy everything to achieve their goals even if that means the instruction of another civilization.The movie was great but too long but I enjoyed every single minute
The 3D also gave another beauty to this movie
I can't wait for the number 3
they are some unfinished business going on."
"The 3D viewing experience is the way to go! The movie is incredibly compelling and emotional when you are fully engaged in it and no distractions. First time I tried watching it the theater has technical difficulties and I got three work calls during the movie. The second actual viewing was absolutely incredible and uninterrupted.The Titanic ending wasnt great, wife and I agreed, end fight was a bit anti-climactic, odd that James Cameron did that, we've seen it before from him and it was done beautifully in Titanic.My OLED at the house looks so much better than standard theater projectors, excited to purchase the 4K disc once it is released and view on the home theater. Definitely see it in 3D!"
"The sequel of Avatar promised better graphics, better effects, better story. But not all promises were fulfilled.First, James Cameron did a great technical job again. The graphics and effects are still the best in industry. The 3D effect still looks impressive. And of course the main problem is still in story and setting.World of Pandora looks too unrealistic. It's like a little distorted version of Earth. Na'vi are just bigger humans with almost the same structure as Earth's humans. Animals and plants are just little changed versions of Earth's ones. The theme of intelligent planet is poorly covered. We have a strange version of the Noosphere.The movie still has a very simple plot. We have a conflict between ultra-green aborigines and ultra-military humans. I wish the plot had more mature anti-capitalism and anti-imperialism ideas.Finally, Avatar: The Way of Water is still a great winter blockbuster because of impressive graphics and effects. But the plot might be more mature and more realistic."
"I honestly wasn't very hyped about the second installment and I avoided watching it for some time. Finally saw it and it's a beautifully made movie but I really couldn't enjoy it.Bad writing is the enemy of the film industry it seems these days and even directors like Cameron apparently seem helpless.The movie has no real story, video games have better stories nowadays and frankly this movie kinda felt like I was watching one, just not a very good one.Story should be key especially in a movie set on a virtual stage. Avatar draws from a lot of cliches, its driven by political messaging and not artistic. So much unnecessary and frankly stupid sub plots and the american teen thing was just annoying to watch.An advanced civilization that united in the face of a single enemy, that is in contact with the spirit of their world, the people who transcend physical aspects of life suddenly start acting like Americans do these days and the same people who readied themselves and their families for death or worse fate because Toruk Makto simply asked them to suddenly find him an outcast, an outsider, and his children ""alien"" and it only gets worse story wise.The whole thing about fighting for family, kinda reminds you of the memes from FnF. When their whole world is one big family, that was the message of the last world. Eywa taught you that stuff just last time, that was the strength of the last movie and frankly I had hoped we'd see something mote concrete built on top of that but No; he just leaves everyone behind and goes missing for the whole movie. The kids are the focal point of the story. We have the ""freak"", the ""big brother"" and the ""lonewolf"" ; seriously expected better than this.But yea visually it's a great movie. Good Job VFX team 👏 👍"
"First off the movie lasts 3 1/4 hours with any intermission. That is impossible to watch with a break.The story recycles many dated Vietnam War tropes, along with too many references to African and Oceanic cultures. At times, I felt like they were even ripping off from Jacques Cousteau.The main characters from Avatar 1 are present, but they have grown up and are not that recognizable. Recognizing different characters can be difficult sometimes.There is little resolution at the end of the movie, and no overt signs of a sequel. I saw the movie in 3D with glasses, but I don't know if the 3D was worthwhile or necessary, just another price gouge.Would I watch it again, even to just see the parts I missed. I'm not sure. Overall, I found the movie anticlimactic and frequently dull."
Amazing work done by the whole team.Really appreciate the effort of James Cameron and his crew for taking so much time and risk in making these beautiful experiences.All the underwater scenes are very realistic and this movie has the potential to cross all the VFX movies going to be made in next 10 years also.This is an Oscar winning movie.Watching the movie in Imax got me chills. The technology used for this movie is an epic one and night time scenes are on another level.It was worth waiting for this movie for 13 years and we got what we needed in this without any single drawback...
"If anyone says that this movie is not incredible, they are either stupid or lying. Regardless if you like fantasy or not, this movie is worth watching on the big screen and noone would regret it. There is nobody else who makes movies that are this high quality or puts this much effort into making sure everything is as they want it to be. It's a product of passion and years of effort. There was not one second during the 3+ hour runtime as every single detail is intentionally there to enhance the storytelling and to keep you captivated. It is both immensely emotional and thrilling at times. James Cameron really does know how to touch your heart and has done a wonderful job bringing this incredible world with its deep and well rounded characters to life!"
"Ok so the first movie was an amazing visual achievement. The worst thing about it was probably the zero-dimensional villain. Someone with no internal conflict, no humanity. Just a muscle-bound douche bag. Beyond that, he's just completely uninteresting. Not funny, not clever, not even crazy. Soooo... let's just bring him back for more of the same? 3 looong hours more?I won't kid you. The visuals especially in iMax 3d are truly amazing and almost redeem this even at 3+ hours. Ignoring the glaring plot holes, and the cringey conversations with pandora's whale population, it was mostly fun, before watching the whole thing devolve into an hour long machine gun battle on the ""titanic""."
"A must-see! I wasn't the biggest fan of the first part, but this film is simply great: wonderful special effects, breath-taking scenery and a compelling storyline. The introduction to other tribes in Pandora makes the feeling of a new world more realistic. The interconnection of the characters makes sense and creates a solid thread for the next takes.There are scences which are simply made to enjoy visually, and others which are heart-breaking. James Cameron took his time in the making of The Way of Water and I can simply say that the waiting was worth it. I personally can't wait to see what the next one brings!"
"Avatar 2 is a great continuation from the original. This movie Immerses you into their world & their predicament.The visual effects, soundtrack & character development is outstanding. Each character facing different troubling situations, to overcome & grow from.This movie is a story rich endulgement, not offering as much action as the original, but more sentimental value to the diversity of the Na'vi species. Offering of tribal clans values & culture to relate to, it's just a brilliant piece of art. James Cameron has nailed it once again. I cannot wait for the third + more instalments!!!I hope the distance between this movie & the next even 1/4 as long for those sequel."
"Spellbinding. The VFX, BGM , Direction, and way of execution define the hard work of 13 years. Visual Treat for cinema lovers. It's going to be Boxoffice Blast🔥.@JimCameron
is a mastermind creator who masters his craft with his own style of making his projects Bang. Those grand visuals in the movie show Cameron's dedication to making this movie an epic Blockbuster. Each and every characters perfectly justify their role.Technologies used for making the movie is just inimaginable. The world of Pandora is rich in having some of the best natural sceneriao. And James Cameron shows his best way to connect with it through his movie series Avatar."
"Finally! Dreams come true...Mind blowing, visually stunning..... The only Sir James Cameron did this. Masterclass story telling, everything is perfect. That's called a Cinema. The train sequence is just oh my god mind blowing..... Winner. The high class action. Go and watch this great film. This is such a great greater greatest movie ever.... Last one hour is spectacular. You will be forced to get up from the chairs. Only the sound of applause and whistles came. And the way Sir James Cameron mixes emotions is superb... Such a wonderful visions. Bow down to Sir James Cameron. Another Masterpiece...."
"Avatar - Way of water is a visual feast to the audience.3D experience is visually stunning and super. CGI animation is seamlessly integrated into breathtaking scale and precisely.The first 2 hours are full of character development. Almost every age of characters were developed. But the Giant whale named Payakan is the most super character in chapter 2.Storytelling is long so you may feel impatient and boring but James cameron keeps distracting you with beautiful scenes. Whether its a pandora, or rain scene or underwater(Which looks like another new world) were mesmerizing.Visual effects are unreal. You can see every detail in depth even action scenes too. Super flow without any blur scenes.Acting is topnotch and they have super chemistry. Score and sound design quality is of cameron's quality.This is a stunning masterpiece which one has to watch in IMAX or 3D and that too for 3 hrs+.Filmmaking and Storytelling at its best.Magnificent. One extra heart for the production efforts."
"Avatar 2 is a highly anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking science fiction film Avatar, which was released in 2009. The film is set to be directed by James Cameron and will feature an all-new cast of characters and a brand new story set in the same universe as the original film.One of the things that makes Avatar 2 so highly anticipated is the fact that it will be filmed using cutting-edge technology, including motion capture and 3D animation. This allows for incredibly realistic and immersive visuals, which are sure to be a major part of what makes the film such a success.Additionally, the film is expected to explore new themes and ideas, delving deeper into the mythology and world-building of the Avatar universe. With its talented cast and crew, as well as its innovative use of technology, Avatar 2 is shaping up to be a truly epic and unforgettable cinematic experience."
"3 hours of the literally same plot as the last movie accept for the same bad guys were blue this time. In spite of overflowing potential to look at a hyper intelligent race of whales, a god like entity on the planet, colonization and so much more they were all little more than ignored to drag on a painfully predictable story of kill the bad guy to save the family. I was waiting the whole time for something new some twist but in the end the biggest twist was that it really was exactly what the first 5 minutes telegraphed.I really liked the first one but this was a tremendous disappointment and I was waiting for it to end. James should probably retire while he still has credibility."
"Avatar was the first 3D movie I ever watched at the cinema, so I watched Avatar: The Way of Water at the cinema and in 3D as well.This is a very visually impressive movie. Even though I have now watched many more 3D movies, I still felt like the 3D of this movie was superior, on a completely different level, really, than most. The soundtrack also remains loyal to the prequel, which I think is a very nice touch. There are some surprisingly very medically accurate details here and there that I absolutely did not expect to see, especially considering some of those characters aren't even human.But the plotline couldn't have been more disappointing.The movie starts by recycling the bad guy, which would've generally been a bad idea in itself, but they somehow managed to make it even worse. They literally went and put a racist inside the object of his racism and somehow thought it would be believable that such a creature would still want to kill his own kind. Worse, they thought it would be believable that the USA would sponsor such an investment of human and material resources for the sake of finding and killing a single blue creature for no apparent reason besides a more than questionable personal vendetta!Then they have the good guys make, hands down, the stupidiest decision of the whole movie. Jake Sully knows the bad guys are targeting him specifically, so, instead of staying put and fighting back where he's most powerful (and where he's already won once before) or evicting himself into a deserted area where innocents wouldn't be caught in the crossfire, he decides to leave his best chance at victory and takes his family and the impending danger of his presence into the unsuspecting hands of complete strangers whose strengths he not only isn't familiar with, but also puts him and his family at clear disadvantage in that new community itself! And here I was thinking that dude was moderately intelligent.Even though I really liked Kiri and Spider, their backstory is shaky at best. It just makes no sense to me that Kiri's father would not reveal himself, that with how sacred the whole mating thing was shown to be in the previous movie, and also I find it very difficult to accept that Spider's mother, whoever she was, would leave a small baby behind just like that. That's some sketchy parenthood vibes right there. Seriously, though, it's like the writers didn't even try.Speaking of Kiri, I really liked that character. Her affinity to the energy that connects all of Pandora is fascinating and worthy of a plotline of its own in my opinion, but they did her wrong when they had her have seizures for the sole purpose of revealing Jake's location to the bad guys. Because that was the single reason they did that, as she ends up saving the day through the use of that link with the anemones and the glow fishes and remains completely seizure-less! What unexpected, unexplained luck, huh?Speaking of doing characters wrong, besides turning Jake's brain into an apparent turnip, they also put all of his value as a character into question by what they did with the bad guys' own storyline. Turns out the baddest of the bad guys can also link with the flying creatures, without any previous arduous training, and even without having to restrain the creature's mouth, like Jake had to! Turns out the godly seeds of Enya don't have to choose you to make you worthy after all! Any racist rando can do it, apparently! Turns out Jake is just some dude!! Go figure!!Another character they did incredibly wrong was Neytiri. Where in the previous movie she is presented as being beautiful and in tune with the natural and spiritual world, sensible and knowledgeable and respected, in this movie she becomes nameless. She is referred to as ""Mrs. Sully"", ""animalistic"", ""you"", ""mate"" and ""mother"" but she seems to mostly have been downgraded to a secondary, kind of frightening rabid creature, who has also almost completely lost her name and identity.I loved the tulkun and the tulkun hunt plotline and I wanted to see more of that. I feel like that was a plotline that was worthy of its own movie, a relevant social and environmental issue to dive into and, honestly, touching enough to drive everyone into the story. I was curious about the researcher in the hunting ship, the moral and ethical conflict of his position, the super smart and sensitive creatures, the age-stopping miraculous liquid of the creature's brain...! Everything about that story was just so good! So, of course the writers would use all of this as merely a medium for their pointless personal vendetta thing. What a waste.Oh, by the way, I agree with you, Tuk! I also could not believe that you were captured AGAIN. Believe me, most people watching the movie at the cinema where I watchet it, audibly shared your pain for cheap reused stupid plot moves. You are not alone, child! Most of us also do not like it when the repeated kidnapping of the littlest, cutest, most vulnerable of the characters keeps being repeatedly used for heart-gripping purposes alone. It just gets boring, I don't know. Speaks of poor writing, too. But what do I know, right?Speaking of heart-grippers, let's talk about the most pointless heart-gripper of this movie, which was Neteyam's death. The kid is shot off camera and dies an incredibly anticlimactic death. Seriously, though, some people at my cinema commented aloud ""that's it?"" and laughed during that awkward pause when all the family is just staring at the dead kid before they realize that he just died. I think that was very poorly done except if the writers' intention really was comedic relief, in which case, kudos to them, it was kind of funny. Anyway, the kid dies a dumb death and then, because Spider ends up saving his non-father (which I totally get, I'm not criticizing that choice, I do feel like it makes sense for that character), Neteyam basically dies for nothing. Well, I guess he dies for the same reason all the other bad guys die, and for the same reason all those resources are blasted to pieces, which was to have the big bad FAIL at his pointless personal vendetta and to have Jake Sully FAIL at protecting himself and his family and the people and resources of his planet. Swell.I would have liked this movie far better if they hadn't recycled the bad guy, but instead had Jake and his family visit the sea people to help them with their fight against the tulkun hunts and perhaps still develop Kiri's and even Spider's own plotlines in that context. The kids discovering their new environment and establishing new relationships would have been nicer in that context. There was absolutely no need to taint this otherwise magical and awesome movie with a pointless personal vendetta, in my opinion.I hope that the recurring viewers will make it so this movie does not become an embarrassing flop, because I do still like the Avatar world-building and I would like a third movie. I just wish the recycled bad guy didn't come back to haunt us yet again for the next one, but I guess there's no escaping that stupid idea now.TL;DR: This movie was visually nice but painfully weak plot-wise. Where Avatar was fascinating, magical and awe-inspiring, Avatar: The Way of Water is an expensive but poorly conceived movie about revenge and that revenge almost obliterates the magic and fascinating new things it shows us. It would've been a good movie had been maybe 1 hour shorter and if the recycled bad guy story had been scratched completely off. But like this, it barely gets a passing grade. Good luck for the creators and executive producers, I think you're going to need it."
Waiting over a decade for the sequel left my mind as I was immediately immersed in Cameron's world. The story was well thought out with definite links back to the world we live in now. The melting pot of cultures plays heavily and acceptance regardless of looks. The everyday struggles are shown by parents but the true winner here is the under water scenes and world. I tip my hat to the actors but for J. C who makes the scenes look so realistic. I isn't ruined by crappy CGI (Black Adam) and the little details make this a must see movie for sure. The ever expanding world of Pandora will be on show in the next movie and I can't wait to see the finished production 2024.
"Film is very engaging! From a movie making craft perspective - its also phenomenal. Action is pitch perfect, lighting and color is riveting, shots and angles - on point, most importantly -- nothing is overdone, all aspects of high grade movie making work in harmony, including 3D experience! The story and visual experience will find universal, global acceptance (and box office success) - as its narrative is not narrowly stitched to any language or culture!The man is a master of movie making and remains the pioneer! From Aliens to Terminator, from Titanic to Avatars... Unlike anyone, Cameron's remarkable skills has produced continuous box office gold for decades!"
"Avatar: The Way of Water checks every box of expectation I had in mind!The movie delivers in all departments CGI, VFX, Soundtrack/Music, Performance, Direction, etc. But, the story was a lag and that's NOT a bad thing!When James Cameron announced that there will be 4 sequels (incl Th way of Water), I was skeptical about the deliverance ""The 1st part covered almost everything possible on Pandora, what else are they going to show?"". With this sequel I am convinced that they have it all planned out! This movie was NOT supposed to be fast, it was supposed to be slow and long, the creators wanted the audience to familiarise themselves with the Way of Water and the characters pivotal to the future of Avatar.So go to the theatres and experience this mammoth spectacle!"
"Overall I gave ths film a 9/10 as James Cameron (director) has really considered how he can portray the film in a realistic way. I personally think that the greed involved through the 'sky people' (humans) aiming to extract a subbstance out of the akula in order to bennefit them financially and to develop humanity represents the real greed in this world and shows a very realistic argument for finding other life forms on a diffrent planet. The one thing holding this film back from achieving a 10/10 is that the obvious runtime is not the most practicle of things, 2 hours and 45 minutes is a large fractional amount of everyones day but hey we're now on day 14 and this film has already received 1 billion in the box office, but it would be amusing to see how many people left a fraction of the way through, hopefully, there shouldn't be a large amount as this film has many twists and has you hanging off the edge of your seat both in pain of sitting for too long and in excitemnt, mainly was in excitement for me though. But, in all fairness, this is a work of art from Cameron and his team and hopefully the third comes out very soon. P.s, did anyone see the Hamlet refferance early on in the movie?"
"Great sequel to the first Avatar which was also a 10/10 in my opinion. Amazing special effects in 3D with action packed scenes the entire movie . Cameron does a great job keeping you entertained and literally at the edge of seat on this one. The new storyline with the children , other villages from Pandora, the marine life, etc brought a new level of excitement that has me so intrigued to watch the next sequels. Don't let the time lapse discourage you from missing out on the movie. The transition is done well from the first one to this one focusing on all details to prevent any confusion.Excellent job guys, can't wait for the next one!"
"The striking inspiration of Pandora from Earth is mind boggling. Tulkun is our endangered Whale. RDA in Avatar is one East India Company. James Cameron has done a marvellous job behind the scenes. The depth of the ocean and its pain comes alive on screen. New generations need to see this and feel it. European countries and Japan continue to kill whales for their profits even today.The forests, the aquatic life, the mountains of Pandora are not unreal, we have them on our planet and we need to save them.This movie shows the love and strength of the family and its connection with the nature. We all are connected to mother nature and everyone needs to feel this.Besides the movie is a thrilling entertainer, and a visual masterpiece. We need more like these."
"Avatar is a highly disappointing film that fails to live up to its hype. Despite its ""impressive special effects"", the film is lacking in terms of plot and character development. The CGI creatures and settings are impressive, but they still do not look photo-realistic and the motion capture performances are not fully convincing. The entire three hour saga appears more like an endless intro to a computer game rather than a film. Extremely unrealistic in every respect. I never thought I would get to this point where I would write a negative review for a film from my favorite genre, but here I am, leaving a negative rating for a film for the first time in 23 years."
"This film is just VFX artists working their ass off to make some characters whom we absolutely don't care about. It contains many cringey dialogues and that age old ""sipping coffee while killing innocents"" trope which we saw in the first part; I thought they would change that, turns out James Cameron hasn't changed since 2009(or before). CGI was too good. Had the best water simulation I've ever seen, even the first part had incredible water simulation.We'll get extremely bored during the movie because of the reason I stated before, viz. We won't care about the characters. Everyone is one dimensional. The villain is as one dimensional it can get. Imagine a villain still saying ""I'm going to kill your children"" or something like that! And only thing for us to enjoy is the visuals. But they also gets boring since the novelty factor of seeing these sort of visuals worn off in the first part itself. And the story was too predictable. Went to the theatres without any expectation and I still got disappointed. I'm giving 6 stars only for the VFX artists who worked day and nights without a break. By the way did Jake sully took notes from Dom Torretto since there are many ""Family"" dialogues there."
"1, the human child was pretty much the enemy the whole time and resulted in every stuff up
2, why did they move to another clan clearly bringing with them destruction
3, now they have the memory usb death means nothing, so might have well let the bad guy drown and just bring back 20 of him
3, acting was just bad, especially the children, biologist and whale hunter
4, what about the mineral they were after in the first movie and why is earth now about to die
5, the whale goo is just bs essentially considering it's only worth $80 mill. Yachts are worth more
So much more I just can't fit in here."
"As I sit down to make this review, I'm just now noticing how well recieved this movie has been so far. I'm honestly surprised by the amount of love this movie is getting for its story and writing, I found myself feeling bored during at least half of this movie. I did not have that issue with the first movie at all.Plot - The story for the most part wasn't interesting to me. When I saw Stephen Lang was going to be in this movie I hoped it would be a small part, maybe a flashback, but it seems like they're making him the main antagonist of the series (with a possible redemption down the road). This direction unfortunately takes the massive potential scope these movies could have had and simplifies it down to a Star-Wars-esque family conflict in space. The story felt meandering at times, and it was full of conveniences that served to make the world feel smaller. One quick example being Quaritch's team landing for the first time and essentially bumping in to Jake's children right away. It really makes Pandora feel like a small world. (Yes I realize they were trying to find Jake, but they ran into the kids without trying. In fact, nowhere in this movie did it seem like they were working that hard to look for Jake.)Characters - This movie felt like it was spread too thin. Jake's oldest son dies and I felt nothing, probably because that character barely had anything to do in the movie other than talk to and about the younger son. Kiri is being set up as a daughter of Eywa Jesus figure, but that doesn't really go anywhere in this movie other than giving her some cool powers. Lo'ak's story seemed like the most important part of the movie sometimes, but often took a back seat to the Sully vs. Quaritch conflict. The way Quaritch's character was written was distractingly bad. It didn't even feel like the same person. Maybe it shouldn't have been.Effects - This movie was beautiful. The visuals were stunning, the sound design was very good for the most part. I was captivated for maybe 30 to 40 minutes of this whole movie. Unfortunatly it was weighed down by the script.I wouldn't call this movie bad, and clearly people are loving it which I'm happy about, but I can't help feeling dissapointed. It feels almost embarassing that 13 years later this is the best they could do. I expected more from the follow-up of the most successful movie in the world, especially with how cocky Cameron has been about it leading up to the release. This sequal suffers from problems many other sequels and franchise movies have. Maybe my expectations were just too high."
"JC is making a mockery of us all by simply regurgitating past successes wrapped in beautiful bows of CGI and 'motion capture' FX.1. The graphics were on point, in 2009. Sad to say there was really no noticeable difference 13 years later. James needs to realize what got him here, won't get him 'there'.2. This sequel figuratively 'craps' on the entirety of the motivations that made the audience care about Pandora and everything that made the first one special. (e.g., what about unobtanium, where's the grand unity; the spirituality, why are these once great protagonists now so one dimensional?)3. Completely unoriginal plot accompanied by a lackluster story, to say the least. No depth, no continuation of the moral principles, James just does a fantastic job at insulting the audience by simply copy-pasting climactic elements from past franchises. It's evident the only goal here was to separate money from wallets when after more than a decade of development, we get the same tired old antagonist, altercations and plot vehicles. JC should be absolutely crippled with shame after pumping this the way he has.4. The acting was uninteresting, boring and in many scenes tedious; yes, I'm looking at you Zoe and Sam. Perhaps just a result of their characters radical change for absolutely no gain.5. Character continuity is obviously not as important to this franchise as hectic world building. It's a shame these actors were on-board with such a dismantling of their original characters. Is the audience really to believe that self-righteous American family values just all the sudden trump generations of indigenous culture? Neytiri is reduced to an emotional basket-case of a housewife/mother, with at least half of her script being wailing in anguish or screaming in anger. Jake's character instead doubles down on the dumb jarhead persona who's only goal now is to keep his family together and safe, like a good little pack of marines, yet stumbles miserably at that. Quaritch is just a steaming pile of disappointment, I can't describe how lazy and dissatisfying it is to see them base the continuation of the franchise on this shallow, unrelatable ogre. Kiri/Grace could have had such potential, but instead the audience gets lackadaisical religious doctrine with little to no explanation nor acknowledgement by any of the other characters.6. Character development is on par with the Hallmark channel. Now that Jake and Neytiri have been reduced to mindless nuclear parents, we get uninteresting kids who do nothing but the opposite of what they know to be right, simply for the sake of introducing dramatic affect to move the story along to the next unoriginal conflict. Entirely new populations of characters now some-how know a great deal of the English language. Their youth seems eerily in-tune with twenty-first century teen culture and similarly are inherently disrespectful, rude and demeaning for no other reason than to create cheap conflict resolution.7. The new 'McGuffin' is pitiful and insignificant to the franchise and so forgettable that it's abandoned almost as fast as it's explained. The 'sky people' are back, but is it to terraform or is it for the elixir of life? Who knows and who cares, because no matter the reasoning the message here is clearly the same --humanity shaming.8. The erratic filming frame rates also make this visually exhausting (seen in IMAX 3D). This movie was filmed in 48 fps, as well as in 24 fps and is nowhere near consistent. Every other shot is rapidly switching back and forth, so one scene will be established in 24 fps, then suddenly switch to 48 fps, and it happens throughout the entire movie. I was literally crying in the theatre, but certainly not due to the utterly superficial story.Rating: 2/10 stars: Just bad movie making.Entertaining --yet neutered-- computer aided visuals carried this 3+ hour storyline/screenplay like a donkey through the wetlands. This film was made for the dull and unimaginative."
"Unfortunately I walked out of this movie thinking ""that was....ok"" with no desire to rush back and see again.The issue was being able to stay awake for the unnecessary 1.5 hours between the good start and end. For a while there, I was questioning if it would have been better for Cameron to invest in Titanic 2 and have 2 hours of the decomposition of the ship on the ocean floor. It may have been more exciting.Sure it looks good but sadly the movie felt longer than time between the two films. I believe for the world to endure 5 Avatar films, James Cameron needs build on the story and focus on audience engagement instead of wanting just the biggest movie."
"Contrary to otter People, I liked the first avatar a lot. My opinion of the first movie is almost exactly the same as this one.We all know that Avatar focuses on the visuals and you can really see why. I think that this is one of the, if not THE most beautiful movie ever made. Every shot is amazing and perfectly shot. The cgi and camera worl is never seen before.Then we have the story aspect and this is where avatar lacks in my opinion. It's far from bad but the story is not phenomenal. It's very straightforward but not the best part of the movie. There is one bit that I particularly didn't like and that was the opening scene. I feel that it was very rushed and did not appreciate the ending of the first movie. The story contains a lot of beautiful moments too off course.With this in mind I think that the visuals curry this good story and that's why I give it an 8."
"I didn't even think we needed an Avatar 2 given the way Avatar 1 ended but you can't just make the most profitable movie ever and get away without making a sequel I guess.The one thing you notice after watching a lot of Hollywood movies is that sequels rarely work, but the fact that james cameron is personally invested in this avatar universe gave me hope and he did not disappoint.To get the obvious out of the way the VFX effects were out of this world with incredible places and wildlife. We were reminded that Pandora is comprised of not just plants and big trees but also of beautiful oceans and the marine life that comes with it.People say that the first half felt a little boring and was too long but I felt otherwise,they took their time to introduce us to all the new characters and their personalities and how the
parent-child dynamic is with each character.I was worried that because of all the new characters we wouldn't get much time with Jake and Neytiri but I was wrong,their present felt adequate and their relationship with their kids were also explored quite a lotAvatar 1 climax is basically humans vs navi ,we see almost the whole of pandora along with eywa uniting against the humans so it goes without saying the stakes were incredibly high so I was expecting something grand here too but I felt a little disappointed with how things went but once you know that there are three more movies coming within the next decade it makes sense to carry the story forward in the next movies.On the whole ,just don't think a lot about it and go experience it in cinemas."
"Just saw Avatar: The Way of Water. And I'm very much NOT okay.I went into this movie not expecting this major Box Office film, but expecting a long awaited sequel that would set the stage for the third movie. I wasn't disappointed.I was able to figure out a few of the big twists just based on context clues, but those twists still hurt a bit. The emotional connection between the Sully family was strong and relatively easy(for me, at least) to empathize with. Each family member is different from the other in their personalities, alone. They all have their own unique pattern of thinking that works as the main conflict and resolution throughout the movie.My nerd brain was on hyperdrive because of the biological and evolutionary background of everything. The differences between Na'vi based on what part of Pandora they live in was so epic. Just seeing the subtle differences between people from the Forest/Jungle and people from the Sea/Reef made me so happy. I was so invested for all 3 hours that I didn't realize I had a raging head ache until after the credits started.I was the most excited for the new music we'd be getting. The score of the first movie is already so ethereal. I'm just happy to have more music from this franchise.What James Cameron lacked in ""Wow Factor"" due to the advancements in CGI movies he made up for with intricacy and depth. There were so many little pieces and stories that moviegoers wouldn't have ever been aware of, but Cameron gave brief explanations while leaving so much room for curiosity.I'm so attached to the family created by Jake and Neytiri. The clashes that came with Jake's human upbringing and Neytiri's Na'vi upbringing and how they both adjusted to each other is beautiful. And it works because it's not perfect and they still clash. They created their perfect little family unit with flaws and uniqueness.The film also had its fair share of happy and sad moments. It was realistic in the sense that everyone can try to be happy and live, but in war, not everyone survives. So many movies are set up so that all of the main characters somehow survive a war or natural disaster. The Way of Water was more realistic with the costs of war and the toll it takes on loved ones.Jake isolated his feelings to save his family. Neytiri used hers to fuel her desire for the war to end and for her family to be safe. Lo'ak did what he does best by compartmentalizing(much like his father), but also using the strong emotions felt by his family to push them to keep going no matter what. Kiri rose above how alone and different she felt to use her connection with Eywa to save not only her family, but her new friends and allies. And Tuk reacted the way any child would. She was blunt with her emotions. Her fear and desire to be safe were so raw and real.It wasn't the best movie I've ever watched, by any means, but I'd gladly watch it again. I personally love when movies connect with people realistically and emotionally. The fact that a sci-fi movie about the colonization of an alien planet and war between humans and a 9-foot tall, blue alien race fostered such a relatable and emotionally connected atmosphere is mind boggling.No, it wasn't the hit that Avatar was, but The Way of Water was raw and realistic. It is unforgettable."
"Breathtaking visuals , awesome storyline, & plenty of blueness! What a wonderful world pandora has become and we the audience get this satisfying experience of being in it for three hours. I might say don't opt for an extra large Pepsi like I did or else you will miss out on a few scenes. The characters are on point with their scripts and I believe each one fit perfectly in the plot. I was hooked with the visuals it was like nonstop bliss coming out of the screen so mesmerizing. I didn't want to leave my seat watching this film and I believe you won't want to leave either after seeing so many things put together so well in this film. This visual masterpiece deserves a second viewing just to awe the greatness James Cameron has done with the Avatar universe!! Looking forward to avatar films 3, 4, & 5!! :)"
"A good piece of eye-candy that keeps you mostly entertained through the whole ordeal.The plot is better than the first avatar movie, but doesn't rise past being just fairly serviceable.All of the visual effects were very well done with no noticable mistakes. It's clear that all the effects are the main reason you should see this movie, because it's pretty to look at.I don't really see myself wanting to watch any more avatar movies in the forseeable future, as this 3 hour ordeal is exhausting, and could be a bit shorter, as it slows down in parts.I was hoping for a different antagonist, as this one feels like a bit of a cop-out."
"The visuals are a lust for the eye. The beautiful underwater world and creatures are very stunning. But..The plot is just avatar 2 with a lot of loops that take you in a 3 hours long sit with the same things over and over again. The last hour was just expanding the time for nothing. The storyline is very dull and I dont get it why these humans want to destroy the nature of these new world Pandora?? Its just soo weird. Also the emotional scenes doesnt feel emotional at all, i never felt that ""lump in the throat"". Nevertheless a great movie to see in the cinema for the visuals in 3D, but its not the 12 years waiting worth."
"First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while."
"An amazing achievement at so many levels!I dismissed comments that this sequel is far advanced over the original because I was so impressed by the original , but it is. From the natural supernatural world it creates to the expansion of the cast of characters to the intensity of the battle at the end. ( So intense I do feel that children under four should not be exposed to the level of onslaught.At it's deepest the narrative reflects the contrast between love
(Sully) to semper fi loyalty ( that many mistake for love)in Jake .And it's forgiveness and love as their sons that saves them both in the end."
"Avatar: The way of water starts off great as cameron flexes his cgi and effects as soon as the film begins, but unfortunately this seems to be the only thing of note on display throughout the film as it fails to deliver a meaningful story with any real depth, introduces many new characters that feel like empty shells with little to or no backstory or real growth, a few plotholes, subpar acting by main characters and a few too many typical action film clichés. Along with this there seems to be weird cuts between standard and higher frame rates which leads to scenes not smoothly flowing and coming across as a cut scene from a game.Overall the film is an experience that is worth taking at least once if only to witness its magical visuals that didn't get old with me during its over three hour run."
"This is a spiritual movie who talks to you with words and images simply perfect. This is gonna to be an important part of the cinema story don't only by their amazing visual effects is also by their emotive story who like the way I say it before it don't need words to go to your soul. James Cameron don't pay me for write this reviews this is my honest opinion of the movie I almost cry in so much partsAct 1:
Amazing begin with a beautiful sing to face to you happy moments of the Jake's family for change dramatically to something horribleAct 2:
This is definitely the best part of the movie.This movie talk to you from the screen to your heart to let you simply, ordinary but beatiful fellings About natureAct 3:
So sad a little bit heavy for the hours you got watching the movie but beatiful, horrible and shockingConclusion:
One of the best movies I seen in my life I need Avatar 3 right now."
"2026: A Fifa World Cup is coming to Canada/USA/Mexico. And 4 years in advance, James Cameron does his job bringing to the New Generation, a story of Moby Dick proportions. While he's at it, he evolves Film technology, hence Movie Experience, and makes what Cinema does best: enforce concepts/ ""hey, star people ain't that bad, look at their cool weapons. They are packed with money, backed up by bankers, and will always come back as their technology keeps getting better and better""/ James Cameron surfing with the geopolitical and evolutionary times, as he revisits Abyss, Alien, Terminator, and I must say his take on Spielberg's Jaws, has a very satisfying outcome. Thank you James Cameron for rooting for nature and natives: let's wish folks from all cultures and political ideas, get the message."
"For me, I was blown away by the first Avatar so much that I went 3 times when it first came out. So this time, I definitely wanted to see this one with better technology to see if they could top the first. They do a great good with these graphics. I don't always do 3D movies because they aren't worth it but Avatar 2 definitely is! I must admit at first I didn't wanna sit in the movies for 3hrs +. Let me tell you, I didn't feel the time as much as I thought so that's a plus! This CGI is top notch. Everything looks so real and it makes for a great watch.BUT I gotta say cuz I know most of you won't...I am sick of ""Hollywood"" using all these colonizers to play/represent indigenous people!! Sure a tribe MAY....hug may...btw be mixed, but come on man. The whole movie takes place in a world where the people are blue but the underlying idea that it's some indigenous colored ppl and somehow a white guy and his mixed kids are the star of the show. It's disgusting. And I shouldn't have to mention the fact that this is what the colonizers do all over the world.Also, how is Neytiri's hair braided (& most of her kids) but Sully's hair locs...🤔😐 She looks like she got a wig on and he got the natural locs 🤦🏾make it make sense. And to Zoe Saldana, skip part 3 cuz they only gonna have you crying & screaming the whole movie.In the end, this was a good movie to watch. It has more explicit language than before so be careful with small kids. It really doesn't need 3 hours to tell this story but it's at least beautiful to watch. As a black man...the storyline is some BS tho. We don't need a white savior."
"Cameron has once again outshone himself with this outstanding piece of film. Despite multiple people saying there is no story, a story is only to entice the audience. The premise of this film is to encapsulate you and draw you to the world of Pandora which in itself was done perfectly, thus contradicting those who say story makes something entertaining. Not only that , it holds a strong ethical outlook and shows light on the 3rd world through its tribal manipulation motifs. This film as of the 25th of January has surpassed 2 billion dollars. So those who say this is a bad movie are clearly mistaken."
"This is easily the best looking movie of all time leading up into 2023. They way that James Cameron is able to incorporate the look of the water in to the beauty of the surrounding ecosystem really is what diversifies the film. There is no film that matches the realism other then the first avatar. Once again Cameron has broke through in cinema photography and will pioneer this new race in cgi expansion. If the films keep progressing at this rate, and they do all 5, this could be the greatest film collection of all time. Yes, that includes beating the likes of Star Wars, Godfather, and the MCU."
"I saw the first Avatar in theaters when I was young and it blew my mind, this one is no different. Initially I felt that there was a bit too much filler where not enough contributed to the overall plot, but I do feel that whatever may have been lacking in story was made up for with brilliant character development. I felt so connected with the Sully family by the end of the movie, which leads me to believe that this film will be much more valuable once we have more additions to the franchise.All in all, incredible film and without leaving any unbearable cliffhangers, there is much to be excited for in future Avatar movies."
"Whatever one accuses of James Cameron, there is no way to get past his absolute attention to spectacular detail and his hi-tech vision.Cameron therefore creates his own mythology and takes the viewer into a magical and dreamlike world. The actors stand up to their standards. Sam Worthington is developing into a good action actor, as long as he cuts through films like Titanfall.The story of ""Avatar"" is repeated more spectacularly, as once again the dazzling visual effects, ""handheld"" 3D and imaginative set design try to give interest to an unbearable, repetitive plot.Certainly, this is a well-made film with fantastic effects and the viewer deserves to see it especially in 3D."
"Seen in 3D.I was not very enthusiast of the first movie, but its visive language had some form of poetry that simply wasn't there in the sequel.Yes, the graphics are there, but that intangible is simply not.In terms of an actual movie - not just images - the plot is thin, predictable, and with plenty of things that just don't make sense and can hardly be ascribed to the characters making bad decisions under pressure.The characters themselves are SO cliché it sometimes becomes embarrassing.But I guess that wouldn't be so bad if way too many scenes hadn't been cut WAY too looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong. You get what I mean 🤷‍♂️
While sometimes you can accept that because there is some need to showcase what millions of dollars in CGI have produced, in the ""acted"" scenes it just doesn't make sense: the movie becomes utterly oversized, slow and howmuchareyougonnadragthisyetffs?As if the similarities with Dune were not obvious enough in the first chapter the authors decided to make them adamant by introducing giant animals who move beneath the horizon, have three lipped mouths and produce a substance that makes your life long: plot twist, it's not the film script.I gotta say... The visuals and effects are there and they are the only thing that make this utterly flat and predictable story worth seeing."
"Did those who gave this movie a high rating reward the story or the graphic achievement? The film has an extremely weak and well-known story of tribal wars, intimidation and reconciliation, so that the different cultures can eventually fight the great danger together. Another predictable journey and suspense arc from Campbell Heroes. Few real 3D effects in the cinema. Story has a huge emo content, full of stickiness. The film can be divided into 80% talk and less than 8% action, the rest is devoted to a kind of Planet Earth documentary. The predictable ending is a too obvious hint to part 3 :-(...why always a trilogy... or never ending story...? I was very disappointed with the mediocre creativity regarding the storyline. Give full credit to the sublime graphic performance The question remains.. Why can't there be a movie in the last few years with both a good story and sublime graphic performance? Story: 3 Visuals: 9."
"Avatar the way of the water is mesmerizing. Its an incredible movie. When you've already watched the first Avatar you'd think that nothing else can surprise you anymore till you watch this new movie. When the movie started and saw the floating mountains from the first movie, i was like yeah seen that nothing impressive but oh boy as the movie progressed how wrong i was.It is truly hard to comprehend that what you are seeing is unreal and does not exist. The world that James Cameron has created and the level of detail is simply unbelievable. Its truly on a whole other level or should i say stratosphere. And then the message behind the story is very powerful."
"13 years we've waited for this... really! The Abyss/Aliens & Free bloody Willy. Sounds good on paper but together it doesn't work. I try to be an optimist but after about an hour, the hype went flat.By all means go and see it, there's nothing much better on now. Just see it as cheaply as you can, don't bother with IMAX or 3D it's not worth it. However if this was an netflix or Amazon original that the ratings would be higher. But for a James Cameron film! Very disappointing. People moaned about the lack of story line the first one had. Well be careful with what you wish for, this seemed to lack even less than the first.Sorry if this disappoints people, that's not my intention just my opinion. See for your self by all means, I had the same feeling with Dominion, great VFX but poor story telling."
"I'm not sure what to say, other than that this movie is the best I have ever watched, the most emotionally impactful, beautiful and perfect story, the best visuals, characters and meaning/purpose. I am well and truly blown away and have never wanted to cry so much during a movie.The story line really hits home with human nature and ties in with some of the problems the modern world face and the evil side of humanity, yet at the same time beautifully highlights the world of Avatar and shows how they struggle.Thank you James Cameron I hope you get all the success you deserve for this MASTERPIECE."
"Like many, I eagerly checked the reviews on IMDb before heading in to see the movie. To my dismay it seemed that the film's strengths were it's visuals and special effects, and it's weaknesses was it's story.However, going in with this expectation I was pleasantly surprised. My experience was actually the opposite. While the visuals were beautiful, I felt somewhat underwhelmed with my experience compared to what many people were raving on about. While the visuals are exactly what I'd expect from a AAA film, it wasn't the level of realism I'd come to imagine when reading of people having an 'absolutely blown away' experience.Instead, I was quite pleasantly surprised by the story & it's themes. What some people have described as tropey and simplistic plot writing, I saw as a refreshing call-back to themes that I realised I hadn't seen in recent film. Sure the main story was itself simple in a way, yet throughout the over 3 hours of run time there are many many moments of unique, emotional moments and smart thematic intent. By the end of the film I actually found myself quite connected to some of the characters.If you like me were considering missing on this film on the assumption that it would be ""all fluff and no filler"", I'd encourage you to reconsider. I think some people may be sleeping on some of the complexity of story-telling that James Cameron achieved in this film."
"What we get out of a movie depends on what we're in search of. Visually stunning is an understatement. I would just as soon understand quantum physics than comprehend how this film was made. Worth the price if only to sit in amazement of the technologic accomplishment. But we don't go to the movies for that do we?It's lacking in originality & the storyline is weak and used just to show off technology. You lost me at the resurrection of Quaritch. Same plot: ""man bad"", war, battle, carnage, pyro, teens rebelling, loss and the foundation for sequels. Long, really long but never boring. Not really sure why Mogley was cast ?? Did you notice Sigourneys voice was dubbed for her Nav'i ""daughter""? No regrets tho', It was a great Saturday afternoon get out of the house 4 hour event. 30 mins of trailers, yes. I haven't dwelled for one minute on the experience of it since leaving the theater. I wasn't moved or excited or called to be a better person. But it was visually amazing. Pixar and Dreamscape are even amazed."
"I will Try not to say much that hasn't been covered in other reviews. But at first.. i didn't expect much of Avatar 2, even though i found Avatar 1 quit brilliant.. the bar was set so high and you know there is no other way for the story to continue other then the sky-people returning to Pandora, as the Na'vi sure as hell are not leaving the planet on spaceships !What's noticeable technically is that the image so freakin SMOOTH and the 3D effect is actually working the way it should... i had to google afterwards to see if this wasn't actually 60 fps or something.It's indeed 48 fps, so double the frames and it enhances the 3d effect. No wonder people are so stunned by the visuals.The essence of the movie shows both the tribal/indigenous/spiritual side of human nature as well as great sci-fi tech. But it's all done in a convincing way, you will recognize both the technological side as well as the deeper spiritual meaning if you have any experience with either.There are SO MANY little things that make the movie satisfying to watch.General Ardmore ( the female army boss ) is wearing an exoskeleton and is beating a boxing pole, but it's done SO well that it looks realistic and powerful.The new ""stars in the sky"" AKA ships from sky-people that approach pandora are using rocket boosters to slow down on entry ! It sounds and looks freaggin EPICSome water vehicles are similar to exoskeletons under water like crabs, smooth AF !A huge hovercraft like battleship ? !The sea tribe and their dolphin like creatures are a great add-on. The whale, just like here on Earth, steals the showLittle kid (Tuk / Tuktirey ) is hopping happily on the bouncy hammock like path. You feel her joy.In fact you feel the whole family and tribe vibes really well !The Na'vi yelling and chanting is done well, and each time they do it before riding their beasts feels powerful !Reference to the Maori's HAKA !There is too much to add in a review..One of the most CRINGY things in movies is when a new ""language"" is MADE UP... like in Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings or whatever. It's often CRINGY and just not done well... at all.Avatar isn't always perfect either in that department but it's OFTEN convincing and feels real with the emotion of the actors, VERY WELL DONE in that difficult area.The tiny flaws the movie has are worth mentioning to be objective, but the good side overshadows it.I've seen it only once ( so far ) but i just missed a little part of the story that explained how the general's son was suddenly there ? He's a very cool add-on, one i wouldn't have thought of myself to add, but it worked well. He's like a little Tarzan/mowgli or monkeyboy as they call him, VERY COOL.In fact the characters added are well designed and they add to the story.There is so much info one can add, but i rest my case..Even if you don't like sci-fi this can be a movie for you, as i've seen people love it who actively dislike the genre... simply because it's done so well.Avatar might sound silly on paper... blue aliens.... Who cares ?!But it's done in such a convincing and often recognizable way.It's a huge eye candy and GOOD-SPIRITS-FEST !A MUST WATCH !"
"Plenty have already written about the plot holes or lack of a plot whatsoever. The often terrible and cringeable dialogue and the fact it is over-long.What I want to touch on is the tech.I watched the film at 3D IMAX as this was the best option available to me. I expected to be wowed, and for the most part I was.The introduction of the water world, in particular, was stunning and incredible immersive. It was great to see 3D relevant once again and put to such good use.However, it wasn't far into the film when I started to notice something familiar. Certain scenes looked less natural and more like video game graphics or even like TV picture quality when you rev up motion smoothing. And these scenes kept coming. Particularly during battle passages or fast moving chase or flight scenes. But they would be interwoven with normal looking content.I remembered reading somewhere ages ago that Cameron wanted to experiment with filming at faster frame-rates, so I put it down to that and tried to re-engage.But, between this frame-rate business (which didn't bother my wife) and the plot and character issues, I can't, in good conscience give this film more than a 6.When I got home I did a little searching online and sure enough, there it is and very obvious. Cameron decided to film the action sequences and more at 48 fps, which is twice the cinema camera tradition of 24 fps. This is what creates this effect that, to me, is closer to a video game experience in style. For me it does not make, particularly the forest scenes look more realistic, but quite the opposite. I really don't like it.However, and as I said, my wife didn't notice it and wasn't therefore bothered by it. Maybe I'm sensitive to it, but there you go.As most have said, there are some stunning visuals. And I would agree. I would also agree that most of these won't have the same impact on the small screen. But personally I think a good small screen will be enough for me for any further sequels.I do wish Cameron would consider the writing and characterisation a little more, before seemingly obsessing about technological leaps and frame rates. It's a shame, it's such a beautiful world. But is just not enough."
"I'm tired of reading and seeing these reviews about a simple story- oh shut the heck up! If you're a fan of the first Avatar you know not to expect ""The Godfather"" for crying out loud! The story is good, with new characters and better CGI. I watched this movie in IMAX 3D and it was amazing. The movie was more than 3 hours long and me and the kids never got bored once.We need more movies like this. Movies where we can use our imagination be creative and view something that was built from scratch. The Avatar movies are just that. There are a enough movies out there that are based on true stories or politicized garbage.Go to the theater sit down and let this movie take you on a journey. Kind of like floating on a lazy river - you don't want to rush through it. I enjoyed this movie more than the first Avatar. In my opinion, the emotional moments are more profound. I looked to my left and saw some watery eyes which is always a sign of heart strings being pulled.Scroll past the simple story reviews. If you liked the first Avatar you won't be disappointed."
"It was way too long and i honestly just lost interest half way through. There weren't any major twists either like id say its pretty predictable. Its ok but i dont thing its worth watching.I dont know maybe its something wrong with me cause the other reviews seem good but in my opinion it was a waste of time.(btw this is just to finish the 'required characters': itsitditditditeutrtuxlgditee48digdf

"For start I would like to say that I love the 1st Avatar movie.I was expecting this 2nd part so bad, but it was just a disappointment.""Video game"" feelThroughout the entire movie there were scenes where it was like looking at a video game. Because of that I couldn't be drawn into the movie. It was like you are watching movie and falling into the story and into that world and BAM, here comes some ""video game"" scenes and at that moment you are being pushed to the reality that you are actually siting in the cinema.Dont get me wrong. Its visually great, but for some presentation video or a video game, and not for a movie. I mean, Avatar 1 looked crazy good and from start you were pulled into that movie, into Pandora world and everything that was happening. It was visually stunning all the way without any ""video game look"". I understand they are trying new technologies and all, but you cant sacrifice that movie experience just so you can show how good can something look and to show more details in scenes with high intensity moving.Story/ Plot/ FeelingsFrom start there were some scenes that left you questioning how did that happened. Its possible they will resolve that in the future movies, but still. Story is a bit shallow.I didnt connect with Pandora or the people or some character at all. Usually you connect with one, or few, characters and you follow that character development and have emotions when something happens.In Avatar 1 I was also connected with the whole world of Pandora. Watching that movie I kind of felt it was something alive.In this 2nd part nothing. There are multiple characters, but I didnt connect with anyone. At some point it was a bit boring. When I say that, I dont mean about lack of action scenes. Im saying that I have watched movies that have ultra little action scenes, but the story was driving me whole the way. That was not the case in here.Overall those 3 hours in cinema really felt like 3 hours (and not like 20 minutes when you are pulled in the movie and follow the story).I am a kind of person who can watch movie marathon for 2 days non stop. If I like some movie I can watch it like 100 times, no problem. I remember that I watched 1st Avatar in cinema, and in next 7 days, I watched it 3 more times with different friends.For this 2nd part I already had arranged plans to watch it with someone else again, but the sad part is I really cant. I told that friend to watch it with someone else, or even better to wait and to watch it online.I hope they will look into a lot of comments and make some changes for future parts. BTW this 8 star rating is not honest. Even if there were not ""game like"" problems, the story and everything simply is not there. Its like someone organized and paid rating to be high...At this point, honestly, I dont even care if we will ever see parts 3, 4 and 5. If they gets out and be like this 2nd part, I will watch them one time just to see the story. Beside that, Avatar 1 will be in my heart as stand alone movie that I will gladly watch from time to time."
"Bro, It's been too long! No one cares about 3D anymore Bro! But, here we are after a 13-year slumber, waiting to be proven wrong by James Cameron. Does he do it again?Visually, Cameron manages to meet audience expectations making full use of Dolby 3D although personally, it was a little bit jarring when frame rates were switched. You can expect to be transported to Pandora's seas. Wakanda forever or Aquaman's underwater scenes cannot hold water against James Cameron's Avatar. That said, Avatar needs to pad up in the story and dialogue department and maybe also try cutting down the runtime a bit.Kiri was a standout character for me. Jesus! I didn't even realize it was played by Sigourney again.""James, I will watch your movie as many times as I have to!""
Sincerely,
Your Fan."
"For someone a Big of a fan of Avatar 1, I was definitely not expecting this sequal to be as good as the first. LUCKILY I WAS WRONG. The animation is extraordinary, perfected and nothing like the first. Sure, it last for 3 hours and 12 minutes, but it is so freaking good and exciting that you won't even notice if you have to pee. This is my 2nd time watching it in the cinema, and I would definitely recommend. Hands down the best movie made in 2022. YOU ARE BRILLIANT JAMES CAMERON AND WE LOVE YOU! The long wait was worth it in the end, and know that all of your fans will fight to make sure all future movies is going to be as popular as this one. Looking forward to the next movie already!!UPDATE:
I went to see it in 4XD when I was seeing it for the third and last time in cinemas. Absolutely amazing. I see people who rate this movie 1, that is not possible and makes me mad. Alone the visuals of the movie is 5. Yes, I can agree that some of the scenes need some work when it comes to dialogues but name a movie that doesn't? Still, this movie makes you feel like you are on Pandora. I will say, if you are going to watch it I would recommend 3D or 4XD. Be prepared for laughing as well as crying. For the ones stupid enough to not get the message: EARTH IS PANDORA. That is the reason he used a ""tulkun"" because we are killing animals very similar to this creature. And for the people who are just missing a part of the brain; spider could not be put in a cryo because babies can't survive in one. The plot is somewhat repeated but at the same time no. What is not repeated in Lord of the rings? Harry Potter? Characters and storylines are meant to be repeated in small doses to make a successful film in my opinion. After all, life is repeating itself every day.Please read the meaning and make sure you understand the first movie before you rate this a 1. Because it really does not deserve that and I think you know that too. Don't drag a film down in the mud when you don't know anything about it. Make James Cameron proud."
Awful story with worse writing than ings of power with just slightly better visuals. I really don't understand how people can like this crap...The first movie was oke with good visuals but it just got far worse. And don't believe what the inbox say. We are in an Inflation so every person pays way more for tickets than for 1997 titanic which was Cameron's last good movie tbh.So if you want a visually strong movie we're you can just switch of you're brain and ignore all the flaws it has ( I mean it's completely flawed but ok) than go watch this heavily overpriced movie nobody wanted but we still got.
"Ok if you already watched movie then you know that children are in lead roles. Which I don't like it. But visual effects are outstanding. You never seen this kind of visual effects. Story is just same, where Avatar 1 villain wants revenge from Jake Sully. And he targeted Jake childrens.It should have been more better if Sam Worthington role had bigger. But we can expect better things in Avatar 3.It is more child movies. But worth to watch for it visual effects and action.But definitely not the level of Avatar 1.Water scenes were awesome. Never seen this kind of under ocean scenes in non animated movie."
"We know Avatar is one of most cinematic with stunning CGI works which was released 13 years back
This part ( The Way of Water ) is just
Marvelous, splendid, Extraordinary , an cinematic miracle, stunning and spectacular visuals of sea and the creatures and an immersive movie I have ever seen. Must watch in 3D
Every part of the movie has to be admired on how James Cameron portrayed . This is absolutely brilliant and obviously an treat to watch his masterpiece work !!!! You will throughly enjoy the spectacular views of sea and its creatures and all characters are well portrayed . Must deserved for Oscars."
"I did find the movie a bit long plus the wee bit of language. Lost that one star. Sorry. Myself, I found the visual effects were stunning. The imagery was excellent and I found myself trying not to miss any of it. I don't comprehend any loss of storyline or anything negative. I thought it was a great segway from the first one.Graphics left me glued to the screen.Overall, it did great justice to the storyline, narrative, and visual effects. Even the facial expressions were fantastic. I very rarely go to theatres for the simple fact of wasting money only to be disappointed. This was well worth it. I sure hope that this gets the correct nominations it justly deserves."
"Better storyline and character develop could have made this into two stunning and deep, amazing movies! Unfortunately I felt the lack of deeper character development resulted in the action moving too fast and most of us feeling unattached from the characters. So much potential and the teens and below I was with still thoroughly enjoyed it, but I left feeling unmoved and wanting more (and I certainly don't mean more time!). I keep asking myself why did it need to be so painfully long - is it just to try and stand out? That being said the visual aspect and wonder certainly helped make the time go fast, but still everyone in the theatre was checking their phones for the time A LOT! I really wish I chose 3D instead of DBox (where seats move, vibrate etc) because it would have helped to be a more immersive experience."
"I recently watched Avatar 2 and was thoroughly impressed by the stunning visuals and immersive world-building. The characters were well-developed and the plot was engaging, keeping me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film. The action sequences were thrilling and the special effects were top-notch. Overall, Avatar 2 is a must-see for any fan of the science fiction genre. The film raises thought-provoking questions about the relationship between humans and nature and delivers a powerful message about the importance of understanding and respecting other cultures. I highly recommend Avatar 2 to anyone looking for a visually stunning and intellectually stimulating cinematic experience."
"This movie create a new history in this time after covid when movie industry going down thats time james camaron hull the boat & create history. The graphic & used Technology was awesome... When i went hall its my first time experience to enjoy 3D movie... This movie action, Graphic, emotion create a different senario. The ending scene was soo much emotional. I saw some of the ordinance was cryning for the scene. Jemes Cameron create a new era, new Technology, new action theme... Such a Beauty. I personality recommended everyone please go hall & enjoy the movie. Its worth for money & time........"
"Sometimes just one scene can tell you all you need to know about a film. In Avatar, The Way Of Water it is the Hakuna Matata shot of Blue Guy Número Uno raising up his baby boy to the skies.That visual cliche sums up the movie. You get a little Tarzan, some old Western train heist mini-movie, a lot of Finding Nemo scenery, and an entire Moby Dick (in Space!) film with a little Dances With Wolves ""white man teaches you how to fight the white man"" for good measure. But when it comes to the story, it's a lot of blue and turquoise cardboard cut-outs tugging at your heart strings. And maybe I'm heartless, but it didn't connect.Actually, I can't be heartless. I absolutely loved the Baby Shelob The Builder spiders and the crab cabs. I didn't care for the new skinny exoskeletons, but most of the space hardware was space cool. And Pandora *is* pretty. Not so pretty that we need what should be a five second shot last fifty seconds, but at least you can go pee without being worried about missing anything important. It still is the story of a manly man protecting his family because another manly man is trying to harm him. Sure, the manly men are blue, but an important lesson from the movie is that manly men are manly. Also, don't be wasteful and save the environment. But mostly, be manly.Should you watch it? Sure! Everyone else is. But don't try to be manly and hold your pee for the whole movie. That would be bad for your manly kidneys. And really, you have seen this movie before, just with normal hue humans and a shorter run time."
"This movie is inspirational and intriguing. I haven't seen a good movie like this one in a long time. The writing and the effects were amazing. I loved that it had a message and had no political agenda. Family was its prime focus and we are missing that in movies now. I also cried 4 times in it. This movie will touch anyone, no matter what religion, race or background you are apart of. There's a universal truth to it. I can't wait to watch the other movies they are producing in the next few years. Even my 3 year old son was able to sit through this 3 hour movie. It didn't even feel like the movie was that long because I was entertained the whole time. I do recommend that you watch the first movie before this because it ties into the whole plot."
"I suspect I'm not alone in having my suspicions that the 2nd Avatar would simply be more of the same and that if I paid the $50 (tix & snacks for the wife and me) I'd leave the theater feeling fleeced. I often times feel that way with these super-hero movies although truth be known, I'm a sucker for the ones with witty and sarcastic repartee and good music. I spoke with PSH II after he went to see ""Avatar: Way of the Water"" and while he conceded he understood my apprehension he thought it worth the time to see the movie and so last night the wife and I drove over to the Brea Regal East and watched in it 3D.I'll cut to the chase on this one. I thought it was fantastic. Never in the 3 hours and 12 minutes did I feel the pace lagged nor did I start looking at my watch. In fact, I didn't even leave the theater once to make a restroom run despite all the sloshing around of water as I did with Titanic.I had initial reservations about the the plot and in that regard I was largely correct. Same conflict; peaceable native folk driven to defend themselves and their land from the invading West Europeans, err, humans from earth. That conflict has been told so many times over so many centuries that it can and often is simply a backdrop to tell other stories, to consider other subplots. And such is the case here and that, along with remarkable CGI, are what make this movie go.The cast from the first Avatar largely return. One personal note of disappointment was that my father's friend's son, Dileep Rao, (@leepers500 and #DileepRao) who played a significant role as a scientist in the first movie doesn't figure too much in this movie. Can we throw a bone to a East Asian American who's first name is not Mindy or Kumar? I don't know him but I root for him because of our fatherly connection and he's a really good actor who has acted in a number of fine films. Regarding the others though, who doesn't enjoy the passion and partnership of Jake Sully and Neytiri played by Sam Worthington #samworthington and #ZoeSaldana? And let's not forget one of our most memorable modern cinematic ne'er-do-wells Colonel Quaritch played by Stephen Lang #StephenLang. He personifies all that is evil about imperialism; the hubris, greed and absolute disregard for others who are different.James Cameron wrote the story/screenplay along with Rick Jaffa #RickJaffa and Amanda Silver #AmandaSIlver and they introduce some new, compelling characters who, whether by design or simply artistic serendipity, are set up to tell stories of their own. And to be honest, I'm actually curious to see what stories these new characters tell.I don't want to reveal any spoilers and so I'll wrap up here, but I have to mention the technological and cinematic accomplishments here. I loved the first Avatar; Pandora was a magical, fantastical planet where all of it's animals including the Na'vi understood their connection and responsibility to all living things on the planet. It's a world that appeals the pathologically-idealist in us; some of us anyway and it's clearly designed to hit us humans over the the head to get it together. This installment introduces some conflict that will resonate with us stubbornly uncooperative humans. But, that makes it a more relatable story.Visually this movie is stunning. It has a lot of the same landscapes which look like album cover artwork by Roger Dean (#rogerdean) on a Yes album from the 1970s. But, there's also some change in scenery as one should not expect a planet to be entirely old growth rain forest. And that's the case here, but what a world Cameron and team reveal. It's, once again, stunning. And in 3D? Wow.In short, if you have some time I'd highly recommend this story and particularly if you can see it in 3D. I don't keep up with advancements in cinematography but it seems that 3D is better than ever and the characters move and the landscape hangs over the first 10 - 15 rows of the theater. It's quite remarkable. Check it out #AvatarTheWayOfWater."
"Avatar 2 can be predictable at times and seems like the same old story we've seen before. But at the core of the story is a heart-felt emotional rollercoaster That is worth taking a ride on. It's thought provoking In the simplest of ways, and can be profound, it shows true meaning of family, loss, love, and loyalty. It reaches into you're very being and grasps every emotion you have. The scenery is so breathtaking that after 3 hours you feel like you are a part of that world. The acting is Superb! Zoe Saldana Gave every fiber of her being in this role, she sold me on every raw emotion she was feeling.So when it comes down to it. Is the story predictable and Simplistic at times? Yes. But between the effort in acting and how the story unfolds. I gotta say, James Cameron did it again. I highly recommend my friends."
"I am a amateur filmmaker that still believes cinema is an escape but James Cameron is one of the few working right now making it so. The cgi is 100% better from the original, any better it would be physically Navi flesh. While the VFX/CGI are very realistic, the overall movie is on par with the first one. The story is more original instead of being a Dances With Wolves rip off but is 30 minutes too long and Sigourney Weaver simply cannot play a teenager even with motion capture. Stephen Lang has the best character development making his character more menacing and intelligent than before. The underwater scenes are worth the cost of seeing the movie in IMAX 3D."
"In my opinion, this movie was the best film of the year compared to Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (which i really liked also) and Wednesday. This movie had stunning shots throughout the movie, and the characters were amazing as usual. The emotions captured in the na'vis features has definitely evolved from the 2009 movie and look substantially better. Whilst watching I definitely cried (actually i bawled my eyes out) at some scenes which definitely tugged on my heart strings. Concluding I believe that you should definitely watch this movie as it will definitely give you adrenaline and amazement. I am super excited for the coming 3 more movies (2024, 2026, 2028 save the years.)."
"I was looking forward to see this movie with friends,because even when movie is not that good its fun watching it because 7 of us are sitting all together and having fun. This is the first time me and resr of my friends were counting the time to get of from the cinema. I have to admit,visualy,hat down. Story!? Honestly I can not remeber the moment when I really wanted movie to finish. And I saw movie with Beyonce with my girlfriend. I would watch it again and not ever this. If the movie is around 120 minutes long,maybe it wont be that hard to watch. But this....honestly,I regret for paying the ticket to see this."
Firstly for a 3 hour+ movie this didn't feel like it. I was gripped throughout and thoroughly invested.There are some cliches in the story and some borrowed themes but these felt well executed with some subtle nuances that keep things fresh.The visuals are stellar. Absolutely jaw dropping and you can see where the money was invested. The 3D was as good as I've ever seen and by the end of the movie I stopped noticing the 3D and it just felt normal which is a compliment.The only issue I had with the movie was remembering all the various names but that's a minor minor quibble in what I felt was just a great movie.
"This movie was everything I had hoped it would be and more. It had the perfect mix of visually stunning scenes, and action. The action scenes were a good mix of exploration and adventure, as well as tense fights. There was a lot of funny moments that had everyone laughing, as well as some sad moments that had some people in tears. The film in general is pretty lighthearted and funny, but there is some tense scenes with some intense action. The storyline was very simple, but in my opinion that's not a bad thing. The story compliments the image shown on the screen. The picture does more than a thousand words. The 3D felt a lot better utilized compared to the first Avatar. The HFR made it everything feels more alive, it made you feel like you were right there. If I had to summarize my thoughts on it... It's a simple movie where the picture does a lot of the talking.I saw I on the world's tallest IMAX in Pooler GA (3D HFR). For those that haven't seen it, I definitely recommend watching it in 3D HFR if it's available to you."
"Let me preface this by saying that I went into this movie with low expectations. It's been over a decade since the release of the original, so the initial ""magic"" of the first Avatar film has definitely waned. Also, with the current political climate, as is the case with a lot of TV shows and movies that have released recently, I was afraid that modern narratives and political issues would be apparent. However, thankfully, The Way of Water was devoid of this. It appears that James Cameron went into this production simply wanting to make a decent film and, in my opinion, that's what he did. Now, the movie is long (over three hours), but afterwards I noticed that I never felt bored, nor was I looking at my watch wondering when it was going to end. I was generally entertained from start to finish. The story was well-written, the acting was good, and the special effects were (as one would expect) spectacular. Of course there are some drawbacks. Being 3+ hours long, there is definitely some fat that could have been trimmed. The cast is just a bit bloated as well. It's hard to keep up with all of the characters and the various storylines as the narrative jumps around. However, these are minor complaints. Most of the characters were well-developed and I found myself empathizing when tragedy struck. Overall, I'd give this film a 7.5/10. I genuinely left the theater interested to see where the franchise would go next."
"This is not a movie, Its a documentary on Discovery channel.Just came back from watching this long awaited movie and felt like I wasted 3 hours of my New year. There is no story in this movie, Its just a prolonged documentary where you see good VFX and animation.As suggested by others, this is not 2009, Avatar-1 had a great story to it apart from its animation. It showed the bonding of Navi people with nature.If the Director wants to live up to its reputation then he has to bring in more strength to the script. It like there was nothing else to show therefore the Director made the kids do the misadventures again and again. It was cynical when the little Navi ""Tuk"" said that I cant believe I am caught again on the boat. I too felt like ""What Not again"".The only reason why I gave it 2 star is because I hope its a prequel to something good brewing up."
That movie was fantastic. It was three hours and 33 minutes. The movie was protected. Excellent I love the scenery and the Bluewater. It was just wonderful and you guys did a fantastic job filming this film. The movie expired me so much. I was so much like in it. It's a little bit different the first one but it was wonderful. It was just beautiful and I really enjoyed myself so much. I didn't know this movie was gonna take about three hours and 33 minutes to finish at the end was just incredible. Thank you again for making this wonderful movie. I hope you guys get a lot of stars and lots of awards. Thanks again.
"How do you critique the legend that is James Cameron? I grew up on film, literally Jaws and king kong. Jurassic park. Avatar 2 is by all accounts a spectical. Mr Cameron brings all of his experience to the table, from the abyss to terminator, when you watch James Cameron films you know you are in for a good ride. Avatar 2 is no exception it has all the Cameron quality you expect. Really annoys me, people with words, no imagination. How do you criticise, something you have never understood.Art is something you experience, it is not something you write about. So fail every single time, why? Because you know little x."
"Beautiful, Emotional, Epic! It brought me to tears several times and gave me so many great spine chilling moments. I think anyone that has kids and a family can relate to this greatly, it teaches us a valuable lesson that family is so so important and so is your home, your roots and where you came from!This movie has everything! Awesome action scenes, beautiful emotional scenes, comedic funny scenes. The visual effects are the best I've ever seen!! The sequences filmed under water were my favorite - especially the Na'vi and Metkayina reef people swimming gracefully with the Tulkun Whales.I Highly recommend seeing it in theaters! Never seen anything like this!!"
"The visual effect is good but not mind blowing......After 10 years of its first movie, you'd expect the tech has developed a bit, so it's good but not exceedingly good as I expected.Other than that, the plot is boring, the script and lines are mediocre, 1 hour of the movie is a teenager movie, describing a kid went to a different school or place and trying to fit in.The fighting scenes at the end is alright.Overall I'm disappointed. I wanted to see a movie but instead I saw a special effects show-off with no effort invested in the story..............The actors delivered its best, my favorite would be Nyetiri and the monkey boy."
"I've never understood the big appeal of avatar, even though it had the highest box office of all time. So when my friends asked me to watch the sequel, I went in with basically no expectations. And oh, I never thought i would completely fall in love with the universe of Pandora.It´s a fact that the script is predictable, but for me this movie serves much more as a build up for the next ones than a movie with a beginning and an end. Even though his script isn't so strong, It fully serves its purpose to introduce us to the land of the Metkayina and their costumes, while having a lot of action and emotion.Now talking about the strong aspect of Avatar 2, which is basically everything else. The visuals of the movie are astonishing, with a so sublime use of the 3D and CGI technologies, that created an experience that i never saw on cinema before.I could talk about the beautiful environments, the perfect setting of the sea, social causes addressed in the movie, but that wouldn´t be enough to describe what i felt during that 3 hours. Avatar 2 is not only a movie, is a beautiful expression of love and care about cinema in general, if you are going expecting a perfect story with lots of action, that´s probaly not the movie for you, but maybe the next ones could be!"
"Avatar the way of water was such a great movie. Watched it twice! Would probably go watch it again. Seen it in Dolby Cinema first and it was good but went back to watch it in 3D. After learning this movie was made to be watched in 3D. Would recommend to watch in 3D. I've never liked watching movies in 3D but this one was the exception. What a great storyline. It's
so captivating it doesn't feel like you've watched a 3hr movie. My daughters loved it as well. We are big Avatar fans since the beginning in 2009. Can't wait to see the rest of them. Would recommend, specially for families. The wait for this movie could have been shorter but definitely worth it."
Avatar 2 is a great movie theatre experience. Yes the 3h+ runtime can be off putting but I did not feel that the film was slow at any point. The movie flowed well (no pun intended) and had a good mix of heart and quality action. The final third of the film was a joy to watch and was well done. All the characters were well played and additive to the story with the younger avatars being the stars of the show. My only nitpick would be why do these people have to be avatars? I feel like this movie would be the same or better if they were humans instead of Eiffel 65's hit song. I would recommend going to see in the theatres just to experience the world of pandora as it was intended.
"As with Avatar 1, the story is very derivative but the visuals fully make up for it. The story itself had me roll my eyes a few times in the cinema, the villain is the same one as in the first movie and lacks an interesting motivation imo, as his only goal in the movie is to kill the main character because he betrayed the team. The dialogue also seemed very forced at times. But as it was with the first Avatar, you watch this movie for the beautiful visuals. This movie has the best cgi I have EVER seen, with was even more jawdropping considering that a lot of the movie okay in/around water. The Visuals are simply stunning and probably the best I have ever seen in any movie, and for me personally they are miles ahead of even the first avatar. This is what makes me give it a 9 Star review."
"First of all, credit where credit is due: the cgi is great, the action sequences are intense and satisfying to watch - there's a lot of eye candy here. The movie definitely doesn't disappoint in that aspect. The long story short is if you care REALLY REALLY A LOT about that, you'll probably love this movie.But here's the bad news: that's really the only good thing about it. This is the kind of movie where if you stop and think too long about it, it falls apart very quickly. The plot, characters and writing are all somewhere between mediocre and terrible. I feel like I spent half the movie rolling my eyes. Okay, you want the humans to be cartoonishly evil bad guys with poorly-understood motives? Fine, I get it, imperialism is bad. I can accept that as a moral theme. But I feel like recycling this colonel character is honestly just a lazy move, and only further retreads things we've already seen.They do a really bad job with character development and making you feel emotions for said characters. For example, they give Jake's younger son a lot of screentime only to kill off the older son... it would've been a much bigger gut punch if you actually killed off the character we cared a bit about, but no, that would be too much for a movie like this. Gotta keep the stakes low. Also, does anybody else find it weird that Jake refers to the humans as ""sky people""? Bro, you were one of them. I swear that line made me laugh out loud. Yeah, I get it, he gave up his human body, blah blah blah. But still, I find it hilarious.The pacing for this movie can make it downright boring at times. As I said, the action sequences are phenomenal, but the problem is that there are these huge gaps where not much of anything is going on. There's a lot of underwater scenes where almost nothing actually happens and I feel like a lot of these scenes are solely implemented to show off cool cgi and that's it. It gets old after awhile. I feel like almost an hour could've been cut from this movie without losing anything important.The cherry on top is the painfully obvious sequel baiting and artificially high stakes. Yes, I get that James cameron is pumping out a bunch of sequels, but I think the setup couldve been less ham-fisted. The idea of Spider (human boy living with the Navi) saving the colonel could make sense, showing that he has some level of feeling for him, but then Spider runs off back to Jake and his family again and act like nothing happened, as if he didnt just screw Jake over big time. I guess it could show some kind of emotional turmoil -he doesnt know whether to pick Jake or the colonel- but it just seems like a forced way to keep the big bad guy in the game.The other glaring thing was how they artificially raised the stakes near the ending. All the water navi plus the whale and Jake attack the human ship, and they've got the humans on the ropes with their ship sinking when suddenly all the other Navi dissappear and its just Jake et al vs the humans again. Where did they go? Why didn't they finish off the human ship? The answer: because James Cameron wanted the movie to run another half hour and have more tension. Can't have the good guys win too easily, no, they've gotta make it riskier. There as to be a drawn out 1v1 fight, of course.Look, I'm the type of person that likes to really evaluate whatever I watch. I dig into it. This didn't pass the test for me. If you're the type of person that just likes the pretty visuals and doesn't care about bad writing and plot holes, then I'm sure you'll like this movie a whole lot better than I did."
"Okay, let's get something straight from the beginning. Yes, the visuals are amazing, I get that. But this is not some Unreal Engine promo.I never expected nor wished for an outstanding plot. I say with all honesty that I went to the cinema without any expectation for plot at all. And yet, no matter how much good will I armed myself with, nothing could prepare me for the horrendousness I've just witnessed.There is absolutely nothing coherent in this movie whatsoever. There's too many characters, too many plotlines, too much stuff going on. There's too many moment that require massive narration to explain the backstories. It's just too much to handle, and nothing goes any direction. There is never a purpose, never.The characters are, for the most part, unlikeable. I could not bond/empathize with a single one of them.I should add that I am really not a big fan of film plots where all characters always make bad decisions, without exception and also without any learning outcome. The character development in this film is absolutely missing. Gone.I don't think I've ever felt so much disappointment about a film ever in my life. I am deeply disgusted."
"That's it.The only good thing about this is the graphic
the imagination is overall - you can find these in most fantasy novel.Not to mention the movie didn't tell you what the meaning of curtain word ( but can be predict from the flows )
and I also expect some curtain act from new character like the water tribe way of fighting
The monster is less memorable than moby dick.The bad side is jumping out and hitting hard
The story, plot are nothing worth to mention.It's all about ""sally stick together"" or family kind of thing which is cliché and boring.The protagonist is way to strong may be that arrow are made of vibranium."
"This film was easily the best film i've seen in terms of visual quality. The quality of the CGI was impecable and was used on a scale that I have never seen before.Unfortunately the ilogical and corner-cutting plot stoped me from apreciating the quality of the special effects. It seemed that due to the focus on CGI, the story suffered. Particularly in the beggining, some of the decisions made by characters simpily didn't make sense and felt like a poorly written excuse for a change of setting. I lost count of the number of hostage situations but by the end they had lost all meaning and you just started assuming the captive character would escape. Two of the characters looked identical and sounded simmilar which made it difficult to dicern between them. It felt like the makers of this film were relying on viewers not to question choices made by the characters and just blindly belive in the protagonists."
"It's no debate that this movie is one of the most stunning CGI works ever; James Cameron employed unique technologies and imagination to produce a wonderful world.Regarding the movie themes, they touch on scientology and faith, oppressor vs oppressed, human greed, family, healing, love, and more; but it doesn't hit like the first Avatar. In any case, it was enjoyable and makes for the perfect family movie. The plot is simple, and I don't think that's a weakness for a movie of its kind.The weakness however is in the dialogues and characters. Some didn't feel like they belonged here, especially spider, who felt out of place and cheesy in many times."
"My whole expectations crossed. Overall a good experience excellent VFX and Storyline I liked and i want part 3
Visual effects production is highly situational, meaning there's a lot of different approaches to the art of a successful vfx shot. This is the first training I have ever seen that acknowledges this right up front, and then proceeds, with numerous examples, to walk the viewer through a number of approaches and techniques to achieving a certain effect. Showing what doesn't work often has more educational value than just showing what does. This training excels at this throughout the course. The viewer is left with a very good understanding of what is possible, and a sense of the best approach to tackle a particular challenge."
"Bad follow up to the initial hit film. The main plot of the second film is the same as the first film, same bad guy comes back, confused motive for human prescience do they need a new home or the resource or if the locals, the bad guys have all the advantages of being an avatar, and it counts for nothing, subplots and prolonged and often have no resolution. The first film dealt with the connection between Pandora and the environment, Jake learning about this, his inner conflict between the original mission and his new found love, with all these now being assumed knowledge going into the second film, it seriously lacks depth. No need to have such a long run time, a drawn out poor film, I wanted this to be far better."
"Loved the movie. It took quite a number of hard-to-believe leaps to make the plot work, but I just took it for what it was and enjoyed the film.I just wanted to publish this here to check back later if I was right.I predict the plot over the next movies to be that the colonel turns into a good guy and helps the avatar peoples defend the planet against the invading sky people. As a blue man who also has a Pandora-raised son that saves his life, I predict that the colonel's character arc will somehow make him flip sides and join the natives to fight against the sky people. He will learn that he cares about his son. He will live as a blue native. He will learn to ""see"", just like Jake did. He will atone for his sins in a dramatic fashion by sacrificing himself or dying in battle right after his character finally learns a moral lesson. The battle will no longer be Jake VS colonel (idk names). The new villains will just be the larger-sprawling sky people plotting to take over the planet, and the series will end in a war being narrowly won by the native tribes and human defectors coming together, while the surviving human species has to learn to live peacefully in balance with the planet and its peoples.Kumbyah.I'll check back in 15 years to see if I was right."
"This movie was everything I could've hoped for and more, everything about it felt so meticulous having the story flow and not feel so everywhere all at once. This may have been a 3 hour movie but it didn't feel that long at all, constantly showcasing more and more of Pandora and the family dynamic was entirely captivating and left you speechless.Having more emotional weight in this film than the last due to Jake going from single young jarhead to a family man who is protecting his home. There are some more graphic scenes (bring kids, not children) which is needed to show more weight on what is to come.Lastly the graphics alone are mindboggling... It actually looked so real it actually shook everyone watching the film from what I saw. The entire movie is a visual masterpiece whether on land or in the water, but the close ups are so real it feels like they are right Infront of you!"
"James Cameron returns with possibly his most visually stunning movie to date. The theater experience of Pandora is absolutely phenomenal. In particular, the underwater sequences are breathtaking. You can tell why it took so long and cost so much due to the detail, color palette, and scope of the fictional world that Cameron brings to life.However, just like the first Avatar was a retelling of Dances With Wolves/Pocahontas, Way of Water is also a retelling of a simple, generic family story. The story isn't bad, but it's just not enough to be spread out over 3+ hours.Go see it for the incredible visuals, but not much more."
"The great: obviously visually it's masterful. It's fun to see how far CGI and special effects has come. The end fight scene was fun to watch.The good: Jake sully does have a hot wife.The okay: the script is okay but very predictable. I went in and left with 0 expectation that Jake Sully would die or even come close to death. And sure enough he went John wick and obliterated 100s of marines.The bad: the motivation for why the colonel (or sergeant I don't remember) has for finding only Jake Sully. And why he has an easy time committing mass genocide but can't keep a hold on to the children.The ugly: what the heck is up with slide saving his homocidal maniac father? My goodness I haven't seen a more cop out, this movie was just a setup for the next, move in a movie in awhile. What did we achieve?"
"The movie was amazing! You truly get such an emotional attachment with the character's ,literally couldn't stop crying .I knew I wanted to see this movie when the trailer came out but was kinda afraid I was gonna get bored of it fast or fall asleep cause it was gonna be three hours long .Usually I do fall asleep in the movie theaters while watching movies but this one... nope I watched all the way through because of how good it was! So excited for the next one! Recommend for everyone to watch it, it's truly a cinematic experience thats just beautiful and makes you feel apart of it. My honest experience 10/10."
"Do not listen to the negative reviews, it is bigger, better, and cooler than the first movie in every way! Unbelievable graphics and action, looks amazing in every single way. JC's attention to detail is just fabulous, and it shows here. Cool new characters, great new machines, cool guns, great cgi and scenery to be spell bounded by. I loved the film, the the 3.5hrd just flew by. I don't know what people were expecting with this film, but it is superior to the first one , it moves quicker, looks better with great editing. Go see it in 3D if you can, it will blow your mind!! It is the best way to see it imo."
"Let me start with an ode to the 3D with high frame rate: what a show! I've refused to take part to the hype of the 3D since such movies were to me unwatchable, but this time I thought to give it a try, exactly to see the progresses of the technology. Well, the show is spectacular, finally one can enjoy the 3D effects without suffering from judder or de-interlacing-like visual distortions, great job! BUT the producers apparently spent all the budget in the technology and computer art, and forgot to pay decent sceenwriters...The story is basically a subset of the first Avatar, i.e. Only the easy part of it, good vs. Bad, the bad and greedy destroy everything for a profit, the good live in harmony with the environment and in the end win...maybe. Basically Cowboys vs. Native Americans. And even the resuscitation and (at the end) rescue of the bad guy seems just the usual way to prepare for Avatar 3...the only good thing is the attempt to tell the story of individual charachters...but hey, the joy of the eyes compensates the boredom of the mind largely..."
"13 years is a long time. Worth to watching this movie but Leak's in stories. You can predict what will be going though. On the other hand its visual, its every scene tie up to the end. You won't feel like a three hours movie. That's James Cameron's Magic.There are some fun moments in the movie! I loved the tulkun, a hyper-intelligent species of whale that can communicate telepathically. I thought they did some really neat stuff with all the ocean and aquatic bits, which is no surprise given James Cameron's love of the ocean that permeates so much of his work, in better films like Titanic and The Abyss."
"Movie is visually the best on the market . I was quite taken aback by the level of quality this movie showed . Absolutely amazing visuals, lighting, sound, everything . If the movie was solely based off of quality it would be 11/10. The movie itself was an enjoyable watch , similar to the first in terms of what you should expect . Overall the story is about an 7.5/10 overall . The new character are interesting and definitely have room to grow in any upcoming movies, TV shows, games etc . Definitely worth the watch in cinemas , is an absolutely amazing experience . Especially in 3D!! The main thing this movie did well was make me look forward to future Avatar IP and I certainly believe most people would agree to."
"I am going to be honest with everyone,I got really high while watching this movie. The only problem is that it was so long that I was just sitting there during the climax is a post high trance. Other than that, good visuals and visual Art direction, mediocre but acceptable plot, and the determination to be a decent sequel to the 2009 award winning epic classic Avatar. Honestly, I've never seen the first one, just never peaked my i retest enough. Though as a Avatar virgin I still enjoyed the slow yet epic story of a father and his family. The visuals of this movie where mostly my favorite part of this movie, since I've never seen the first one and was very confused on the lore through the movie. Overall, decent movie that was a fun escape from the miserable real world we live in for a few hours."
"Avatar: The Way of Water is a visually stunning and groundbreaking sequel that surpasses the high bar set by the first movie. The 3 hour and 12 minute runtime is a testament to the capabilities of today's cinema, and the movie's stunning visuals and cinematography are truly mind-boggling. The water effects, in particular, are some of the most impressive ever seen in an CGI film. The realism and attention to detail in the water is truly impressive, and it's easy to forget that what you're watching is not real. The movie's reported budget of $350 to $400 million makes it the most expensive film in Hollywood history, but it's worth every penny for the impressive and innovative special effects.The film's director, James Cameron, is a master of his craft, and it shows in every frame of The Way of Water. The movie's plot is thrilling and engaging, and the character development is superb. The movie's cast is also top-notch, with strong performances from the entire ensemble. The world-building in The Way of Water is also exceptional, with the movie's stunning visual effects and CGI used to bring the breathtaking world of Pandora to life.One of the most impressive aspects of The Way of Water is the attention to detail in the movie's water effects. It's clear that the filmmakers took great care to ensure that the water looked and felt as real as possible, and it shows in every scene. The movie's VFX artists estimate that a short 2-second clip from the film cost a staggering $100,000 to create, which is a testament to the dedication and hard work of the movie's crew.Overall, Avatar: The Way of Water is an exceptional sequel that sets a new bar for animated and computer-generated cinema. The movie's stunning visuals, impressive water effects, and thrilling plot make it a must-see for fans of the first movie and newcomers alike. With the third Avatar film already partially shot during the production of The Way of Water, fans can look forward to more exciting adventures in Pandora in the coming years."
"The one thing I will say that will never cease to amaze me is the visuals. Even the first movie back then for its time had amazing CGI visuals. This movie topped it by a long shot. Beautiful scenery. Downside to this movie that I could not stop thinking about during the movie was the filler. Obviously movies have filler. Thats apart of the experience. Though, it seemed every other scene was the kids getting in trouble. It was infuriating to me that every scene almost ended up in the kids getting in trouble and people overreacting. Needed more from this movie after long years of waiting. Disappointed."
"Some movies are intelligent, and when the movie cuts, you're left with something to dissect and think about.Some movies are thematic. They leave you with emotional highs or lows, perhaps questions are asked but the theme is the only answer you're gonna get.Avatar 2 isn't either of these. Instead, The Way of Water is like reading chapter 2 of a really, really great book. This chapter is full of incredible character moments and character introductions. Beautiful experiences that you (the viewer) are a part of. Some important character progression and of course, world-building.But, it's only chapter 2 of 5, and that's OK!People have been complaining about the lack of story. That's because their field of view is too narrow. We're part of the 'part1, part2' era of movies now. Avengers 'mainstreamed' the idea and now every upcoming movie has a 'part 1' label attached. That's not necessarily a bad thing. But judging by how much Avatar 2 leaves on the table, you can bet that we're in for one hell of a ride for part 3, 4 and 5.My prediction is Avatar 3 may leave the audience with a more satisfying intermission between movies. Whereas Avatar 2 does leave you wanting for more straight away. Understandably, that's a bit annoying. But in the years to come, people will appreciate The Way of Waters's place in the story. It's chapter 2.As for the standalone film, it does fall back on a few easy story beats. But due to the otherworldy experience that takes your breath away (no pun intended), you really can enjoy this movie and I'm already planning my second viewing with some more friends. Please go and support this movie in theatres. It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience for many of us to enjoy this in 3D.I hope anyone reading enjoyed my little review and I can't wait for the third chapter.Callum. H."
"I can hear the execs being pitched... ""Okay guys, just think Game of Thrones meets Little Mermaid meets Titanic meets Platoon... Set in the future but women and girls are still subservient to the patriarchy. Guaranteed to be a blockbuster!""And where did they get bubblegum? From a vending machine, a 7-11? Do they get paychecks, what's the purchasing process like? Do they have bank accounts? My attention deficit mind wants to know.In the theater I went to people were sleeping, others were on their phone... And it was almost sold out. I fought to stay awake and did but my friend slept through the entire thing.I was sure one character who died was going to be saved by the one creature that could give eternal life... Missed opportunities.Still it was pretty to look at and there were good moments. After seeing everything everywhere all at once, with such a positive message about fighting with love and connection and compassion in a brilliant way, I thought this could have done something similar. I'm just tired of weapons, it's such a weak prop in movies these days."
"The movie was so good, it was good with everything from the cinematics all the way to the emotional connection with the characters. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone and it's best to watch the movie in 3D for the best experience. It's one of those movies with such a long run time but it honestly doesn't have any boring scenes. Your not sitting there being bored through a 3 hour movie thinking that any of it is boring and not entertaining. James Cameron really put his heart into this movie and knew what he was doing from the start. Definitely a step up from what avatar 1 was when it came out."
"An absolute masterpiece! I enjoyed every second of it. Despite many critics, I actually loved the story. It was slow and the story dragged you into the world of Pandora. I have to admit, sometimes I lost my attention a little bit because everything took a bit too long, so the only criticism I could give is to make the movie a bit shorter. The long story also made the ending more engaging.The visuals are just outstanding. What a beautiful world it is. Also great amount of action to enjoy in this movie. I can't wait to watch it again once it's available on Disney+. I highly recommend this movie to everyone."
"Avatar - The Way of WaterWay too long!A lot of time wasted in telling the story. Lost interest after 2 hours in and noted quite a few of the other movie goers appeared to as well. Just got really boring and dragged after the 20 minute mark of the third hour.A lot of CGI this movie much like the first though maybe more so, gives a gaming feel. Dialogue and some characters left much to be desired.Storyline was quite typical and predictable, relatively moderate it's not one I would care to watch again.Ending is very cliche.Really underwhelming.I only paid $9 to watch, it was worth what I paid."
"Avatar: The Way of Water is a stunning visual feast for the eyes that truly immerses the viewer in the breathtaking world of Pandora. The action sequences are thrilling and the special effects are top-notch, making it feel as if you are right there alongside the characters. The plot is engaging and thought-provoking, delving into themes of environmentalism and cultural understanding. The performances of the cast are excellent, with particular praise going to the lead, Jake Sully, who brings a depth and complexity to his role. Overall, Avatar: The Way of Water is a must-see for any fan of the franchise or anyone looking for a thrilling and visually stunning cinematic experience."
This movie was visually stunning. The way the water and the animals are done is the best thing I have seen in cinema for effects. The plot was a generic story with the bad guy wanting to have revenge but it's own unique twist wich makes it great. You feel like the bad guy is the same villain but a different view on life. The only problem is the watch time. You don't go to avatar to see the story or character development ( even though it's great) you go to see the effects and 3hrs of effects was not what I had in mind. The reviews also said there was to many characters but my only problem was that 2 brothers were looked to alike. Great movie overall.
Neeed To Watch.Story was Pretty Good.But it lacks some story in avatar 2... Therefore Avatar 1 was Good and story was up to mark.But when I watched avatar I was amazed and it was really good to us but when watching avatar 2 the history could have been a little better I think that the people should like it but thinking otherwise they should like itWhatever the avatar 2 was but I think everyone should like it I haven't watch it I will not go to theatres right now but I am thinking I should watch it onlineI didn't say that avatar 2 is bad what the first one was really awesome ..........
"Avatar: The Way of Water was more than just eye candy, it was an experience that I don't think any other movie was able to provide me.Let's start with the visuals which were gorgeous, almost every shot looks as real as it can get but I did notice a few shots that seemed a little off and one that looked a little like a video game cutscene, the few imperfect shots were a little distracting but nothing that really ruined my experience.Something that this movie does much better than his predecessor is handling the characters, most of the characters felt like real ""humans"" with actual feelings and realistic emotions, I really liked: Jake, Neytiri (although she wasn't given enough screen time), Loak, Payakan and my favorite was Kiri.Even though the movie was 3 hours long it felt like it was barely two hours, nothing felt like it dragged for too long but few scenes were sitting on the edge of doing so being saved by only the amazing visuals that made me want each scene to last forever.After the movie was over the only thing I wanted was to watch it again and again because it was just so magical and pretty, I can't wait for the next movie to come out and make me feel like this one made me. This movie is an amazing experience that I highly recommend for everyone to watch and fall in love with.P. S I watched the movie in 3d and the effect totally elevated the experience."
"First of all I would like to praise the CGI in this movie, stunting job here. The main problem with the movie is the plot, this movie does not bring anything new to the table. This movie feels like a replica of the previous one, humans come to Pandora, they want some rare material, the Na'vi fights them, the main difference is the family dynamics between Jake and his children. The first hour was fun to watch, but the second is just a national geographic episode about the sea, I almost fell asleep during it, and the last hour was full of action. To summaries, go to this movie if you have a lot of patience, liked the first one or you can't fall asleep at night."
"Stunning VFX, nice sound and that's all. Can't believe we have got such a ordinary storyline from James. Lot of things have not been explained and not answered or better to say James didn't care about those this time. He didn't come with any new concepts too. How the way of water is replaced by way for forest? The answer is he just replaced forest with water and rest 90% is copied from 1st part. It missed a lot of things: twists, turn of events, emotional scenes, good fighting scenes. We expect ""story"" as hero from big directors like James, Nolan. Here it seems like something is just put randomly to surround it's VFX."
"James Cameron has done it again! A movie with terrible script and people are loving it. It's the same story told in a different way. 192 minutes of blue people running around, swooning and crying. I was so excited to watch this but I was yawning half way through.If you are looking to watch something with beautiful visuals, watch planet earth. This one is a stunning loser. I hope next time a proper writer is hired and they actually kill the damn old loser.I don't think I will be watching the part three 3.4/10 please next time have a decent story and some proper dialogue. Please save your 3 hours."
"The use of computer aided imagery had truly realised the beautiful underwater life of Pandora. Unfortunately, I felt the entire film was a unconnected series of multiple stories with a weak attachment to each other. Many scenes had felt as if they were simply clipped together and the flow of the film felt jagged and did not relay smoothly, technically and metaphorically. Albeit, at the climax of the film, it felt as if there was now a story and the film was not just a showcase of the visual effects.This film is designed to stimulate strong emotional responses and one of the methods in which it does this is, is the portrayal, and the message it conveys, about the U. S. military and the U. S. Marine Corps in particular. In my opinion the message presented is unrealistic, exaggerated, and disrespectful. Marines are depicted killing non-combatants and children for sport, committing arson against residential structures and generally, as emotionally unintelligent individuals. I could be wrong in interpreting the film is conveying all Marines and personnel of the U. S. military as barbaric machines, and only referring to these characters. However my mind interprets this as the former. This portrayal I had disliked as it was unrealistic and unfair to U. S. Marine Corps servicemen and women.Conclusively the film is worth your time. It is extraordinary in terms of computer aided imagery and not like anything else you will see for a long time. The story does lack in large portions of the film but eventually comes together at a edge-of-seat climax."
"The effects are truly great, I really loved it.However, the story is really disappointing... It really lacks a certain depth. The characters are somewhat bland, and the choices made that control the story are really poorly explained.The movie is also somewhat slow. I get that 3 hours can't be so action packed that it would become tiring, but there are a lot of scenes that don't really add a lot.All in all the movie is worth watching, but I was far more moved by the original. The casting is ok, but some of the new characters just didn't connect with me.Its definitely nice to watch in Dolby Atmos!"
"Another world. Avatar: The Way of Water review : Stunning Sequel.My rating : 10/10
Performances :
James Cameron is known for getting the optimum out of his cast and crew. All the actors came up with brilliant performances. Jakes Sully standout by showing variations in expressions and emotions. He maintained the same intensity to make an impact. Zoe Saldana, Clif Curtiss, and Kate Winslet blended with him to elevate the scenes with their performances. The actors who played the roles of their children brought in good emotions to complete the story.Technical values :
Technically, Avatar-The Way of Water is outstanding. Right from VFX to graphics work everything looks captivating. The 3D effects are stunning and they are not just for the sack of publicity. Each 3D shot has proper research and reason.The Pandora world created is just amazing and is presented superbly deep underwater. Technical brilliance is visible in each and every shot throughout the film.The background score composed by Simon Franglen is arresting and elevates the mood of the film nicely. The photography work by Russell Carpenter is nice. His work registers despite the film having more graphics.The collective editing work done by Stephen E. Rivkin, David Brenner, John Refoua and James Cameron is effective. The production design is stunning and so is the case with the production values Lightstorm Entertainment and TSG Entertainment. For the audience who are watching the Telugu version, the Telugu dialogues written by Srinivas Avasarala elevate the emotional depth of the film decently.The second installment from the creative genius James Cameron's cinematic universe, Avatar has high making standards. Alongside the magical setup and fictional premise created, Avatar-The Way of Water addresses elements like social equality, civilization and takes a strong anti-military stand.The underlying theme of the film that showcases parents protecting their children and vice versa is conveyed beautifully during the ending portions. On the flip side, the main drawbacks of the film are the thin storyline and lengthy runtime. To summarize, Avatar 2 is a greater cinematic experience that deserves to be watched on Imax 3D screen to witness the grandeur.Highlights :
James Cameron Direction
Spectacular Visual Effects
Stunning Production Design
Terrific Cinematography
Climax Sequences."
"Visually it is great, though attimes it was quite obvious CGI. The story is very thin. We moved from the jungle to the 'Maori Na'vi' who live near water and 'worship whales'. When arriving, they get aquainted and a 45-minute-long National Geographic documentary follows. Visually good but does nothing for the story line. They also picked up Quaritch's son who reminds of Jungle Book's Mowgli. No idea on the why and how there.. Also out of the blue we are told that it is not unobtanium they're after but brain juice from the Tulkun whales. Up to 80 million an vial.it stops the human aging process. No idea on how they got that intel, but sure...
All in all it was fun to watch but way too long with a weak story. If the next will be like this, l will wait for Disney+ to release it."
"Good, but too god damn long almost like a tv show. Should've been at least 2h. 3h is really too long for such a short story.Waited for 13 years for this movie to come out but I'm a little disappointed.Liked the visuals and the directing but not so much of the story line.Like how many times did they got
captured but still managed to get away ?Why is it only the sky people and the avatars? Same thing going on over and over it could been more interesting if they changed the enemies and had more actioninstead of the same thing.Started as good and fun but got really boring and long at the end."
"I really wanted to name this review ""Avatar 2: Dances with wolves meets Moby Dick... in space"", but I realised that this will be giving too much away and I don't want to spoil it for the fans.I'm not mad at it, I mean James Cameron really threw everything but the kitchen sink to make this not flop and it looks like it worked. But even though the movie kept me in my seat for 3 hours plus, there were a few things that let me down in the writing of this movie. The first one was not poorly written at all, I think the only thing that people had to object was the lack of originality. So I can't see it as an improvement on the previous part, now losing whatever little originality the first one brought while displaying some bad writing too...At first, I wasn't either impressed or let down by the indians attacking trains in space, just like in the wild west. I mean, surely that's what you would expect from an Avatar movie, so I'm not being silly complaining about that. But contrary to the previous movie, it's not very clear why the humans returned to Pandora. They say that Earth is dying and that they need to relocate, but surely they must have encountered in their journeys across space some other planets too. I mean, for all we know in the beginning of the movie, Pandora is that planet with no breathable air, with an indigenous population that kicked your arse and hate your guts, and the precious crystals that were the whole point of them being there in the first movie are gone. So why the hell not choosing a better planet as a replacement for Earth?More than half way through, well into the Moby Dick part of the movie, we find out that just as in Moby Dick, the alien wales have a precious oil that is supposed to stop ageing for humans. Well, this would be a real reason for humans to insist in coming on this planet, except that in the beginning of the movie they introduced another theme which kind of ruins it. Now, if Quaritch was brought back by having a back up of his memories and feelings made at some point, that would mean that humans were able to reincarnate themselves whenever they wanted. Kind of ruins the plot of them finding an ageing cure, doesn't it? I mean why would that be the most expensive substance on Earth if you could just have yourself saved on a memory stick somewhere? I don't even want to think about what this will lead to when we reach Avatar 5... I really hope they won't figure out that they can now send multiple colonels Quaritchs by copying his personality into multiple avatars and send them just as agent Smith in Matrix. I guess it is inevitable that at some point, parts of the Matrix will get thrown in the mix as well.I'm not going to complain about the dialogues and the superficiality of the characters who resemble more to Fast and furious characters with the same tag line (the most important thing is family!), but at the culminating point of the movie, when the Na'vi attack the wale hunters, the entire tribe suddenly disappears with just the Sulleys left to fight the humans. What happened to them? We have no idea, they just appear at the end of the movie again out of the nowhere they went to.The most ridiculous plot is when the Sulleys are free and want to escape the burning ship, only to notice that due to something resembling oil, the surface of the water started burning around the ship. And everyone just forgets how they have been diving and exploring the bottom of the ocean floor up until that point, so they decide to climb out of the water and on to the ship again. Really? I mean surely diving just a half a meter below the surface would have made it possible for regular humans to get past those flames, not to mention for Na'vi, who have outrageously displayed their diving capabilities for the entire length of the movie. But I guess Cameron just wanted to throw in some Titanic scenes as well, just to make sure this movie has everything in it.I have to say that I enjoyed the 3D effects in the forrest scenes in the beginning of the movie that really made the first Avatar movie. But after the scenery switches to the beaches and oceans, the effects were gone. At some point my head started to hurt, so I removed my glasses for a while, watching 3-4 minutes of the movie without 3D glasses and noticing there were absolutely no effects, just the eventual subtitle which appeared in 3D.So yeah, I had to see it, but I am not sure I will be following this franchise from here on."
My personal experience with this masterpiece is at the top notch level of positive emotions. I will even dare to mark it as the greatest cinematography i ever witnessed. Anyway i will recommend to watch it on the widest imax screen in range. It's for sure a game changing for your first experience with the movie. Script might be something you might would expect to be - not much happening with the thriller part but there is a lot of emotional content that will keep you living with the characters and their adventure. The thing with this sequel is that underwater world is so magical and convincing that there is a huge chance you will lost in dreaming about it. It's safe to say that most of the scenes are jaw opening and will make you come back in the cinema for more! It's a Masterpiece and there are more to come! 10 stars from me!
"Action packed, !!!!eye catching!!!!visuals but lack in story!! !!!James Cameron puts everything in this but forgot to dip it into storyline, 😌😌nice Vfx, .....nice screenplay, climax action sequence were good with underwater sequence.overall every actor has done his job along with the sea creatures......vfx job was excellent..... First half was so boring that audience was having straight face with no expression.... Yawning sound were coming... It was toooooo slow nd completely boring........ After second half it pics up with some action packed scenes... With were eye candy.. Overall in my opinion average flick!!"
"Overall I'd agree the eye candy was spectacular and worth the trip in and of itself. The story generally is pretty much a predictable mash of what you'd expect once the setup is given: Qiddich returns tech reincarnated in a Pandoran bod by means of a ""backup"" recording of his brain before his mission. Realizing his original was killed by Sully, he goes on a vengence hunt. Meanwhile to avoid endangering his whole adopted tribe Sully packs his family and goes off far away.Overall the film is over long on the initial exposition and the battles .... a good editor would have insisted on leaning it down at least half an hour, and would have been right. But Cameron is such a towering figure that he could get things his own way no matter what.And I agree, go watch the movie. It's a great ride despite being over long to the point of tedious in some aspects. (these folk get themselves taken, rescued and then dive back in to be trapped again ... sometimes several times for the same character. Silly, but an excuse to keep the action going...)But there's one aspect to this film that's GREAT and rarely to never seen in other films I've seen ... something I'd say Hollywood as almost never come to grips with. Sadly it's overshadowed and underdone because of the other circumstances of the story .....That is the complexity and complications of relationships in a larger family! The amount of give and take affection and resentment between the older sibs and their father is VERY realistic, and likewise the inter family tension with the kids' relationship to their ""outsider"" friend whom they treat as virtually another brother while the mother particularly is barely tolerant to borderline hostile to him.As mentioned I almost never see this kind of nuance of familial relationships displayed to the point of becoming part of the story of a major film, and it would be easy to overlook as events quickly overshadow these interactions... but coming from a larger complex family, for me this nuanced interplay between the characters made them MUCH more realistic and my ability to empathize much easier.I wish more films would pay attention to realistic inter familial dynamics and integrate them into stories as well as this one does.Odd that it's done so well among peoples who are supposedly ""alien"" to us. I wonder if Hollywood has s some kind of fear portraying realistic family relationships, or simply that it's so hard to do in a visual medium.At all events kudo's to Cameron for this. It's not like he needed more accolades, but there it is. Another point of genius he's earned in my opinion."
"I didn't notice the length despite watching it in the evening. Visually stunning, great acting and a script that holds your interest throughout- the only critique I would have is that it's slightly simplistic in the 'humans/ robots bad, indigenous good' split (a lot of us do care about the planet and technology can help us with that! )I didn't notice the length despite watching it in the evening.

"Just as a preface, I quite enjoyed the first avatar, whilst it wasn't a ground-breaking story, it was still an enjoyable film that had some absolutely stunning visuals.My biggest issue with way of the water is that its essentially the same, an extremely hollow story with beautiful visuals. My issue is that we have already seen this. So it really dampens the overall wonder of the film, and in all honesty, you start to get quite bored.This is you entire plot.Bad guy rebirth colonel wants revenge for the death of human colonel. He proceeds to speed the next 3 hours trying to make this happen. Eventually he fails and dies again.I know that sounds basic, but that is truly the extent of the plot. That is truly the limit of its depth.The only subplot they have for the entire movie is jakes middle son, who spends 3 hours disobeying anything anyone says, almost always causing issues and not really helping in any way."
"Whilst sceptical at first, this movie has surpassed all previous expectations and has left me in complete awe. The visuals were the best I have ever seen, even more mind blowing in 3D, especially the mesmerising underwater scenes which showed so much clarity and precision.The storyline continued on perfectly from the last, with a smooth and natural progression for the characters. For this reason, from my own humble experience, I might even consider this slightly better than the first instalment.After watching this, it has really made me wish for the return of 3D televisions in the home, and I simply cannot recommend this movie enough."
"Avatar has the best story. It is a very good quality movie. The best CGI i have ever see in a movie. The movie is very emotional, it has action and it has adventures. The villain is the best. It gives a great vibe. If you watch it in a cinema, you can feel the vibe. Also, you can't watch this movie without snacks or drinks. You must have a bag of popcorn or nachos with cheese and a bottle of Coca Cola. You can't hate this movie. It is the best! While watching the movie, you get sad and emotional. You can watch it 10 times and not get bored. That's what i call a movie. That's a 10 star from me. I recommend this movie."
"A surprisingly good sequel that was more enjoyable than the first movie. I was very cautiously optimistic going into this movie. In this day and age of terrible sequels and poor writing, I did not have the highest of expectations, but I was extremely happy with this movie. The visuals were absolutely stunning in every scene. With the new tribes and focus on the aquatic side of Pandora, I still felt the same wonder and amazement as I did in the original as we discovered a new world.My only complaint (and it's a minor one) with the movie is the dialogue of Jake's sons. They were a little too heavy on calling each other ""bro"", even in scenes where the tone was somber or serious."
"Life is a complex and multifaceted concept that can be difficult to define or describe in a single essay. There are countless ways to approach the subject of life, and everyone's experience of it is unique.One way to approach the topic of life is to consider the different stages of life and how they shape our experiences and perspectives. For example, childhood is a time of innocence, exploration, and learning, while adolescence is a time of transition and discovery. Adulthood brings new responsibilities and challenges, and old age can be a time of reflection and contemplation.Another aspect of life that can be explored in an essay is the concept of purpose or meaning. Many people spend their lives searching for a sense of purpose or meaning, whether it be through their work, relationships, or personal passions and interests.Another way to approach the topic of life is to consider the challenges and struggles that we all face at different points in our lives. These challenges can range from personal struggles such as illness or loss, to larger societal issues such as poverty or inequality.Ultimately, the subject of life is vast and complex, and there are countless ways to approach it in an essay. Whether you choose to focus on the different stages of life, the search for purpose or meaning, or the challenges and struggles that we all face, there is much to be learned and explored about this fundamental aspect of the human experience."
"So worth the wait. It was incredibly satisfying to return to Pandora and I fell in love all over again. With the characters, their connection to the natural world, and the simple pleasures of learning end sharing. The intensity of the conflict is hard but it's worth it to see the beauty of this amazing world! See it on the big screen. Wear the 3D glasses. Soak up the experience. My family and I can't wait to see it again. To us the only downfall to the film is they really should have honored the outcast at the end for what he actually did for everyone. That fell a little fat flat. Folks who have seen the movie will know who the outcast is and may agree. Why didn't they honor the outcast as they should! Otherwise, we really did love this movie even with its few flaws and holes in the story. Thank you all for your commitment to this incredible world."
"This is a long waited movie that I think was almost perfect. Besides some of the kid scenes with them being annoying it was an amazing production. I can tell where they're going with the other movies, but 5 is a lot, are they all going to be 3hrs long? Although it was 3hrs long it didn't feel long at all, there were some slow parts but they really kept your interest. It is definitely a movie to watch and you won't be disappointed. I recommend this movie to everyone who has been waiting for Avatar and with the direction it's going they're setting it up for more and more success in the future. I would rate this an 8.7, my best rating for all of the 2022 movies."
"First thing, the positive stuff. The CGI was amazing, better than marvel in every way. The action wa very cool, when there was any action at least. And overall worth to watch.Now te bad stuff. In general, I find that the storyline is the same as in the first movie. Humans want resources on Pandora for dying earth. They use avatars to be able to get around the Na'vi. One dude betrays his species to clap some pandoran girl. Human colonol doesn't like him anymore and wants to destroy all na'vis. Big attack, turns to nothing because jakieboy fights back with Na'vi. And he defeats the colonol in and endgame 1V1. I swear when you point it out like this, there is no difference, even the bad guy is the same it the two movies when he died in the first. Where is the originality. It is like no one on either sides even learned anything. And then you have those random kids that don't have anything to contribute in the film, except to die and have a whole emotional scene no one asked for. I mean, it is great one of them died, because it was a very one-sided movie. Overall worth watching, but very boring and nothing new that is actually useful to the movie."
"I saw the Way of Water this morning.... I can only describe it as the same feeling you get on a huge Rollercoaster before it goes over the edge..... it's simply jaw dropping! I wish I could shake James Cameron's hand.... Look what he's given us over the years! To create this film to such a standard, he deserves a knighthood.... I just don't know how he does it. Anyone who's into movies will know what I mean. It actually gives you butterflies during the action sequences... the pressure on him to equal the first film must have been immense, but he does it! The effects are so good, you feel like your watching the Blue Planet (the BBC Blue Planet) I could sit here all night praising it, but just get to the cinema to watch it!I wish I could rate it higher than 10.... It's that good! Viva James Cameron!"
James Cameron might of just made the most visually stunning movies of our life time. With much help of the budget of the movie being over 2 billion. The second installment of the Avatar franchise does not disappoint after the 13 years we waited for the highly anticipated sequel. But the movie still has some of the same issues the original had due too the lack of memorable dialogue and lazy writing. But where the sequel does improve would have to be in the characters. Mainly because Jake sully newly introduced kids. All his kids have interesting things about them and due to the 3 hour run time they all had enough time to be properly developed.
"I just got out of Avatar 2 as of writing. I first want to clarify that yes, this is a great film. The underwater scenes are very well done, the characterisation is great and the pacing was good enough not to bore me.But the thing is, it somehow didn't leave me with the same taste the original did. And that's the main problem, it didn't have the same ""wow"" factor the original does. And sadly this is another example of sequelitis, a condition 99% of sequels have where it just fails to live up to the original. I just feel that something is missing. Something that keeps this from wowing me like the original.I hope the next movies are better.Oh, and by the way, Payakan is MVP."
"Amazing Amazing Amazing!!! I think they did a great job at creating this beautiful and eye opening movie. It's a history lesson, a look into the future, and a quick realisation of how communities in our society are being affected by the ""Big Money""Must watch in 3D imax!! I recommend this in the theatre over any online platform as you don't get to engage and immerse into the film. Took years to create and it reminds me of how incredible a movie Theatre night out can be. 10/10.I don't rate too many movies 10/10 but this one is special and really is an eye opener into the reality of things in our current society."
"Soo.. after 13 years....this series which we almost forgot but still had a special place in our hearts finally came to a sequel. I think this movie is far more special for the ones who saw the first part when released. I mean it is still special for me even though i saw this movie months before. At first I saw this movie i was wondered by the fact that this movie was made in 2009. I mean just look at this..I was hella impressed by james cameron to succeed in making such a beautiful piece of art in a cinematic experience. I wish i could saw the first part in theatres soo that this movie could have been even more special for me as the Way Of Water..Yes, Witnessing such a beauty like way of water is something you need to experience before you die or live. I saw this movie in theatres and It was worth the money for me. The Visuals, The Cinematography, The BGM, The VFX, The CGI..Everything was top notch. Except the story and character development. Yes, This movie has some major flaws which we are going to discuss.First, The Story. It was simple AF. Like empty like a blank page. Which is everyone's problem for the movie. I too was disappointed by the story arc and the way story led to. BUT It all got converted into happiness as the visuals and the beauty under the water got unfolded. It was a mesmerizing feeling to watch such a scenery to be experienced. It was simply BEAUTIFUL. For me it was the relaxation i want to see in at least one movie, and this movie does the job really greatly. Exploring the underwater of pandora was a heavenly ride to a eternal beauty.For Me, Avatar 2 has a special place in my heart. As i am a person who needs movies who explore the nature to the glory of joy and relaxation.Some things are not meant to have a story.. they just need to be witnessed....And for me.... Avatar The Way Of Water is a non other than A Cinematic Wonder."
"I honestly do not have the words to describe this masterpiece. All I can say is that, after watching this, you won't be the same. You would have seen (in my opinion, and I don't say this lightly) the best movie to have ever been featured at the cinema. The graphics, the story... Everything will leave you breathtaken. Anyone who rates this movie any less than a ten is lying! If you thought the original was good you will have a shock when you see this. The actors are marvelous the story is gripping and the graphics are beyond this world! I can't wait for you to witness it!Well done James Cameron, you did it again."
"Possibly the longest movie i've ever watch in theater yet one of the most fascinating movie theater experience i've ever had in my life, Avatar: The Way Of Water is fun, emotional, and powerful, it hits all the notes perfectly, i never enjoy an adventure films specifically outside planet earth this much in a long time, the movie never stops amazed me not only in the details of all the visual and special effects, but the story of Avatar: The Way Of Water was just incredible, all of these characters are so well written, so well perform, and again i cannot say how much i'm still amazed by all the visual and special effects in this film and it basically 95% of this film was all freakin' CGI, it definitely some of the best ones i've seen, it's so detail and so good that not even one frame including the human where i found some CGI flawed, where i can see the green screen or the blue screen in the background just a little bit NONE of that!, everything is perfect, praise for all the effect team and they deserve all the awards for it, this is how you use a CGI in movie rightly people, back to the movie itself, James Cameron recently reveal that he had planned to make Avatar 6 and 7 and one of the sentence that he said was basically the only person that can make Avatar is him, and you god damn right, i don't think anybody can ever make an Avatar movie than the creator himself James Cameron, because The Way Of Water is simply go down as one of the best movie sequel ever made for me, yes, i like it even more than the first one, not only we got more characters on the film and specifically great characters, upgrade visual, i think the plot is missing and story was bit shaky rather its a visually bliss."
"A grate movie. The 3d is amazing to see, a new world was created from scratch. The plot is good although expected somehow but still, you sit attracted to the screen and do not fill the elapse time.The adult cast which was part of the first movie is doing a grate job as expected from stars in this magnitude, and and new actors - especially the young ones - are playing aowsom.The world crated in this film is focused on the same, and the viewer are not being en let down - a vast universe create from scratch in the imagination of the creators, and it is unique the same as was the forest world at the first movie.I truly enjoyed the film, recommended for everyone!"
"I am 46 years old and I have watched thousands of movies in my life...major blockbusters ,little known indie films, mindless popcorn movies, thought provoking movies, movies that just don't make any sense, all genres from horror to chick flicks...a hell of a lot of movies. Avatar 2 The Way of the Water is THE best movie I have ever watched...I am actually going to go watch again, because it is that good. The 3 hour plus runtime flies by, because there is never a dull moment. What James Cameron has achieved is nothing short of a masterpiece. Yes, some people will find faults with it, complain about a certain character, or some other trivial thing, but that's just people that have their heads so far stuck up their own backsides that they go through life failing to appreciate truly beautiful and incredible accomplishments created by talented, hard working artists like James Cameron. Avatar 2 is a work of art that needs to be seen and appreciated."
"I watched it in 3D and HFR.Cinematography:
I liked the visuals of this movie. There was feeling of immersion, feeling like you were there. Sometimes the frame rate was too low, images seemed jittery. Visual quality was excellent, with sharp images.Story:
Story was very predictable. It is classic good vs evil characters. Original inhabitants vs conquerors. There was nothing unique about that. Fortunately some characters had somewhat interesting side stories. They could have made the Na'vi slightly more interesting. Now they felt a bit too human.Sound and music:
Sound was good, and also the music helped to make the scenes more interesting.Acting:
Acting was nothing special. I don't think this would win any awards for acting. The thing with the Avatars / Na'vi is that you do not relate to them that much.Length:
The movie was engaging for most of its 3 hour length. At the end I started watching my clock.I give 7 because of the visuals and technology of the movie."
"Just in one word its awesome.amazing experience all time favorite movie till now,grate vfx well done.What's Good: It has been released straight on OTT saving quite a few crores of the audience who are already saving it for Shah Rukh Khan's Pathaan!What's Bad: The film is full of 'yet anothers' & it'll remain to be yet another film trying to sell patriotism without any emotional connectionLoo Break: If you take a loo break for every single stereotype in this film, you'll stay forever in the loo & might watch some better content than thisWatch or Not?: Try not to but if you're forced into watching it, try the loo break advice given above."
"I don't have words to describe the movie, every frame had done the eyes rolling and every shot is an wow moment,i think that the story is a little dull except that James Cameron did a marvelous job,sullys stick together.james introduce new world like the oceans that's the way of water,the story could would maybe leads to______,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, AVATAR 03.....,,,,,hope so 😊😊,every scene is a breathtaking but the opposite character is too weak i think it can be more worse ........
Happy endings are so sad but the sad endings are more reasonable present world needs and prefers sad endings."
"This movie was so good i loved every inch of it and the quality was insane. The soundtrack was also beautiful. Officially my favourite movie, the storyline was nice and I don't know why ppl are saying its bad i loved it, also there are more avatar movies coming that are connected to this one.I mainly love the beautiful world of Pandora and the art of this movie, both visually and the music and I think it should have a higher rating because from what I'm reading from the low ratings its nothing much valid. I could go on and on about why this movie is a masterpiece but I want this rating to be spoiler-free."
"This gives you everything. Sometimes beyond what you can expect. Really a great movie. The first two hours are chocked full of character development. There is a character for almost any age. The only one that held any weight for me was the ""a boy and his whale aka tulkun storyline"". The whale named Payakan is by far the most interesting character. I also liked Spider since he made the fewest irritable decisions. The rest of the characters fell flat for me. Although not boring, I found myself becoming impatient, but then Cameron keeps distracting me with something pretty. Even something as simple as the rain in 3D is mind-blowing."
"Avatar The Way of Water was released about 2 months ago. After waiting for 13 years we got the newest avatar but was waiting for so long worth it? Avater is a science-fiction movie, produced by 20th Century Studio. The script for this movie was written by Josh Friedman, Amanda Silver, Rick Jaff, Shane Salern and the director James Cameron. For me this movie was really good but it could me better. The cast was full of well known actors and actresses, the music suited brilliant the mood of the film, dialogues were also great. The thing that in my mind is the reason why it is not as good as it could is the lenght of it, 3 hours and 10 minutes is a bit too long if it was 2 hours and 30 minutes it would be much better. I think that is the only thing that I would change. The movie overall was good and I totally recommend watchng it, especially in 3D."
"13 years.... 13 years and the best that James Cameron, the man behind Terminator 1 and 2 amd Aliens can come up with was poorly implemented HFPS and better looking water. He seriously looked at those youtube videos the put 60 fps in movie scenes and actually thought ""wow this looks super cool"" and decided to put in scenes that don't fit that frame rate possibly on a coin flip at random.When I first heard that avatar 2 was being announced I thought that the worst thing that could happen to it was that it wouldn't bring back the magic that the first movie had. I never could've in a million years be prepared for the worst possible scenario to play out.The reason why games work better in high fps is because people playing the games would be able to respond more accordingly with everything on screen, that is not the case for a film. The action and the dialogue scenes in this movie fly by so brief and quickly and looked so unnatural like that I couldn't absorb what is happening. And it's never consistent, one minute it is hyper as chihuahua on Crack and the next it is absolutely choppy. I guess to make the dialouge scenes give more space to breath but when the hfps is implemented is absolute random.It is a shame too because there are some breathtaking images in this movie but are marred by this horrible new experiment. By the time that the final action scene kicked in my mind was just absolutely done. I stopped paying attention to the story and was just focused too much on trying to process the visuals to the point where my brain was actually physically hurting.Please don't give James Cameron any more money, please don't make this movie a success. Petition your government to ban this film from the public consciousness. If this movie actually succeeds on the back of this high fps in movies meme then there is no telling what damage this will do to cinema going forward.And I give this a 2/10."
"I watched in 3D with HFR and really enjoyed the visuals and the world building. James Cameron knows how to direct action movies and also has a sense for future technology, especially in his favourite territory, which is the ocean and water in general. Every frame is just filled with that sense of detail.But unfortunately the story and the character motivations just do not work for me. Everything is 100% predictable from start to finish. There are stupid decisions being made of main characters, that i simply could not follow and the story itself also feels incomplete, which was quite disappointing in the end.AVATAR 2 is still a good movie and worth watching in the theatre, but don't expect a good story."
"As a movie this is probably a 7/10, but oh boy this movie was nuts. I was transported to this breathtaking world, and two weeks later and I still want to go back. There was like 1 hour of filler, but it was the best filler I've ever seen. It was like blue planet but with blue people. Just a ridiculous experience. I am very very excited for the next installment in the series. Jake Sully was exponentially better in this movie than the last. The hard ass dad personality he took on was very appropriate given his backround. I have so much respect for Zoe saldana as well because even though she was sidelined, her relationship between the kids and Jake was a great change between her personality in the first movie. I did not like spider though, although the concept was cool, I did not really dig the performance or his ever-changing personality. The fight scenes were a treat and much better than movies whose sole purpose is dedicated to the action. I am just rambling at this point, but this is a movie worth spending your entire paycheck on because it is well worth it."
"Yes, the film is beautiful to watch, the CGI is astounding, and the 3D will transport you to Pandora. Everything else is just an exact copy of the first film - they even resurrected some characters to avoid having to come up with new ones - with some elements of Cameron's older films thrown in as well. If you threw the first Avatar film, Aliens, Titanic, and the Abyss into a blender and topped it of with some angsty kids who struggle with their identity, you have Avatar 2. There wasn't a single original idea in the entire 3 hours 18 minute long snooze fest. Just straight up lazy storytelling, Cameron is just phoning it in at this point."
Watched #AvatarTheWayOfWater... Totally overhyped. There was nothing exciting or any novelty in the movie.The special effects and 3D quality is phenomenal but feels less like a movie and now like video games which have amazing graphics these days.The movie drags on and on with a boring plot and unnecessary action. Totally skippable!#avatar The original had a great plot and a lot of new things to connect with. Part could have explored more with the connection with nature. If they would have done that the story could have turned to a new direction instead of the same war waging between earthlings and pandora people.
"Visual effects: 20/10
Story: 9/10
Heartfelt: 10/10
Action: 10/10The 30-40 minutes presentation in the water lasted longer because this way you can know better what it's like to live there, especially if you look at this movie in 4Dx the effects are brilliant, you really feel like you're there and you're living everything that the characters live.I didn't feel like I was watching a documentary film, rather I felt like I was in another universe, one that conveys to me a state of well-being, of tranquility, and the animals and plants that appeared in the movie were admirable, and the message that the film sends us is a powerful one that not all of us can understand.I reccomend it!"
"OK, I love the first movie and was anxious to see this one. Visually it is absolutely stunning. Here and there the graphics weren't complete though. The blue on the skin, esp on the faces looked painted on in some scenes. Some other underwater scenes seemed rushed, and lacked depth, but over all, that's just a small spot on a visual wonder.That said. I HATED the war part. Can't we get past the humans vs Na'vi people? Can't we get like a true struggle dealing with what's living on the planet itself? And the fact that we are now knowing Quaritch will be in more than just this sequel makes me believe that 2 movies is enough.Yes, there was emotion, I really lived for these characters and I'm actually glad I watched it 2D, cause 3D it would have been way too much tbh, but I really do hope that the future installments will leave this battle behind.And adding to that, I didn't like the 'human' behavior Jake had towards his kids. Esp his sons. It's so extremely American soldiar/warrior stereotype. After living on that planet for so many years, he should have been able to let that go sooner.Finally, Neytiri doesn't get enough quality story time in this movie, as did Kate Winslet. Her role is tiny, didn't really get the point why she was cast, other than her connection to James Cameron. .
Giving this 7/10, it's good, visually stunning, but for me also too disappointing to be up to the standards of the first movie."
"The plot was a 9/10 and the cinematography was a 10/10, just based on these alone the movie was a great movie for me.But, there were other things that brought down the overall movie rating down to a 7/10. A lot of the female characters were barely clothed. And even though they weren't human beings the way the film makers made the CGI the avatars had the body shape/ they were drawn exactly like humans. So, seeing the woman with nothing but strategically placed minimal cloth across their chest was annoying to me bc it hurt my overall rating of the movie bc I wouldn't want my 15 year old son to see that, and also I'd rather them be a little more covered up. The last reason that brought my review down was that often during the movie it seemed like I was watching a video game. The cinematography was amazing but something about the camera angles of the CGI or the POV of the characters often mimicked how video games do POV of characters in campaign modes. When it felt like you were watching a video game, as a viewer it pulled you out of the trance of the movie and made you realize you were in a movie theater again.Overall, a very great movie. The beautiful nature scenes of the forest, ocean, and ocean creatures were amazing and beautiful to see. If it wasn't for the minimally dressed woman, and the movie sometimes having the same POV as a video game I would rate it higher.Cinematography: 10/10
Plot: 9/10
Overall review: 7/10."
"It has been long while since the first Avatar movie back in 2009. If you thought the VFX were great back then, we'll prepare to have your mind blown again. Avatar 2 was not one of those bad sequels although I did have a few problems with it. The beginning half was super nostalgic. All in all, It was entertaining, intense, and emotional while also being quite visually pleasing.The story is where the movie lacks. This movie is pretty much the first movie revamped. And I when I say revamped, I mean REVAMPED. Juiced up if you will. The acting for the kid who plays Spider was missing the depth needed to feel his characters emotion throughout the movie. Bringing back the actress who played Grace in the first Avatar voices Kitty who is a young teen avatar in this movie. The effects to make her voice sound younger flopped. She was talking too slow and forced which just made it sound weird.I do like the direct the move goes and what the future avatar movies might hold. There is a ton of potential and lot more of Pandora to explore. I just hope the future film storylines are unique."
"This is the best movie of 2022 and it was worth it . First I will talk about positive . I have seen this movie in 3D and it was amazing , specially the water visuals was a piece of cake . If you watch in IMAX it will be more beautiful than 3D and 4D . Second , family values but in my opinion they have streched . Third , action . Now , let's talk about negative that is runtime which is 3hrs 12min . While watching the movie my mom's head was paining . But might few people have no problem regarding to the runtime just like me . Overall it was a great movie I will gave only 8 stars and do not believe in fake revies."
"After watching Avatar 1 last night then to our local IMAX and watching Avatar 2 in 3D. WOW and OMG by a billion.All the questions of who, what, when and family. Yes it that OMG you have to see it in IMAX 3D was 'twas mind blowing.Now I am ready for Avatar 3.

"Emotional, nostalgic, visually spectacular...I cant remember when was the last time I watched movie more than 3 hours long and I didn't feel it, a time flew by like magic, simply the scenes of Pandora (especially underwater) are magical, Cameron is a great visionary and he just confirmed that with Avatar: The Way of Water. In the second movie we meet Water World of Pandora, magical creatures and Metkayina clan (Na'vis that lives near water).Through this movie, Cameron shows us how big corporations don't care about anything, they don't mind to run over and destroy everything in order to get money, how that negatively affects the planet and nature, and ordinary people. But his mane story is about family, something most valuable, that you protect with your life.I read a lot of people complain about the story, yes its true that villains are practically ""remastered"" characters from the first part, but I don't mind that, come on, or because he ""borrowed"" some scenes from his previous movies (and he did great job there also), this movie is not just story, this is a visual spectacle, I don't remember that I've had this kind of experience in the cinema with any other movie before, Cameron is still visionary No1, and hope that Avatar 3 will be such a magical experience as Avatar: The Way of Water.Ps: Recommendation to watch this only in 3D, because ""it matters""..."
"Parts were confusing or I would say under developed. Bad beginning of movie which is very surprising since they have 1000's of examples of good ones and the early screeners should have let them know too. It was kind of passed through and didn't develop the rest of the movie well. Story, again, the thing that keeps Avatars from being among the best was lacking and they tried to do too much different things and the same things as last time. Does anyone stand up to the script writers or just cower and go with the flow. Hopefully the next ones are better but my guess is no. Really, though, they had all the same comments about the bad story from the first one so they should have hit this one out of the park."
"It's just beautiful, the story is an almost perfect balance, CGI and filmmaking like you've not quite seen. The action is just so awesome. The friggin fish, the whales the water. Just wow. Everyone needs to see this movie.I will say at first the movie is a bit overwhelming, as in there's a lot of new characters introduced but as the film goes on you realize how good the story telling is. They really made you care for the characters that were important. Family! I wasn't expecting the kids to grow on me as much as they did.Middle of the movie is so gosh darn beautiful, the water scenes blew my damn mind.The final act is so much fun. Action packed, hard hitting moments that will make you grip your seat. I LOVED it."
"Breathtakingly beautiful and full of eco conscious messages we loved this movie. I took three 22 year olds and we all came out jabbering happily about the fun we had experienced.Sure the baddie is still bad and Jake Sully is still a jar head with a big heart but that's the backdrop.Sigorney Weaver was great as the channel for the earth mother's magic and very touching in her teenage role. We thought the underwater FX was world beating.The plot is simple, it's a chase movie really but brilliantly done.How much fun must those CGI tech team have inventing strange new creatures to make us gasp in awe?Don't worry, it's not too long. It's just right, like a long warm bath of family squabbles, reconciliation and action set in a sci-fi world of beauty and life and death strugglesKeep it up JC!"
"Avatar 2 is not a movie about action or killing. Avatar the way of water is about saving and loving your family. It´s about survival. Avatar the way of water is about love for one another. People and animals communicate - love is all around us, so is the water. James Camerons 3d effects are stunning. You can feel the water , you can almost touch it and taste it. The movie score is beautiful . James Cameron still used James Horner´s score. The plot is not bad. Yes, it´s more than 3 hour long movie, but believe me, it´s worth the time and money. Just go with your friends, family, girlfriend or boyfriend. Relax and put your 3d glasses on- because i can see you and you can see me."
"Extremely light spoilers!Being a huge fan of the first movie and of James Cameron I went to see the new Avatar at a movie theater in 3D!As expected, visually this is a masterpiece period. It is one of the most visually impressive movies ever made.... In 2D.... In 3D there is an extensive depth of field effect so if you dare to look anywhere else than where you are supposed to be looking (what is in focus) you see a blurry mess which really throws you off and makes you unable to fully take a scene in. (Which in this movie is a sin!). Also the frame rate seems inconsistent. I say seems because I am not sure if it actually is or it is a visual illusion that makes it seem like there are less frames. In any case, some scenes look really smooth and others very choppy.When it comes to the script the movie is really really bad. And by that I mean, it is like a 15 year old wrote it kind of bad. The story simply does not make sense and takes all
the water in from the oceans of Pandora with all the (huge) plot wholes is has. The writers (and yes, it was not Cameron alone that wrote the script) didn't even bother to think answers to extremely basic and important questions.Why do humans hunt Jake since he doesn't want to fight?Why did Jake just abandon his tribe?The humans wanted to kill his tribe they if he was not there?Why call the helicopter to help Grace's daughter (which didn't do anything anyways)? That is literally why they found them!!!Why did not Jake left imminently when he was discovered at the water tribe?Why do the Navi teenagers speak like they are from a big city in the US?And I can go on for ever....Apart from that Avatar 2 the way of plot wholes seems not to understand what made the original great and feels like it was made from different people and for a younger audience. Gone is the serious gritty tone of the first film. And is instead replaced with a more light hearted 2020 teen movie tone which I really really really hate.The characters are gone and it's as if they were replaced by bad copies of them selves (hm that would actually make a more interesting story than the one we got). You look at Jake and you think to your self that is not the Jake I know. And that is the case with all characters.All in All, I think the problem is that you can not take this movie seriously. Seriously! On the one hand it has astonishing visuals and action and on the other almost everything else has been given very little thought. Leading into a movie with little to no substance. No vision (other than the visual aspect) and sadly not reason to exist!Would I recommend seeing Avatar the way to make brilliant tech demo ?Yes and no!Yes, if you do not expect to be satisfied with the story or characters. But want to experience the brilliant visuals and world.No, if you can not wait to see where the story will take you next and what awaits the the characters.Oh and watch it in 2D!"
"This film is amazing I think I am watching Avatar the way of water and writer amazing script and everything
But guys something missing this part so longer
And total film shooting 80% water underwater I am watching this movie part 1 maybe 10 years ago but guys first part is amazing in emotionally connected character ending and c***** amazing
But guys some thing missing film is long 3 hour 10 minutes the big long
I am watching a movie and due to continuous wearing of 3D glasses, my eyes started hurting.Negative and positive point some talking about this film positive point is visual CBI VFX mind blowing."
"The story is pretty similar to the first. Discovering a new part of Pandora... Humans coming... Fighting humans... Yeah it has the same story, BUT it is so beautiful to watch. And their are so many great characters. The chemistry with the siblings, the jokes about them traveling... I loved this movie. I was so impressed that Sigourny Weaver could play a 14 year old so well!! This movie was an epic rollercoaster! New creatures! Awesome battles! I found it amazing! I know a lot of my friends found it boring, but I was near tears at the end. Cameron did it again. Cliche story, but the execution of it was amazing!!"
"There were a lot of under water chilling scenes, where nothing was developing plot-wise, and it felt like wasted airtime. The movie didn't really have to be as long as it was.The movie kind of let you know at the beginning that one of the brothers was going to die. One was a trouble-maker with a love interest and a new pet best friend while the other was like an angel, doing no wrong. Of course he would die. The movie kind of had you guessing at when, not if. But his death was actually totally meaningless. They went back for Spider, who promptly went BACK to the ship to save Katie. And then we found out that Quartrich wouldn't have let anything happen to him anyway, so big bro died for absolutely nothing. Good thing the movie never gave him a personality so it didn't really feel like that big of a lossThe girl kids were interesting but like in the worst way. Katie was a weird character, and she really came across as older than intended. She didn't seem like a child. The youngest kid was just annoying the entire time. She was always in the way or being kidnapped. That was her only purpose the entire film.Zoe Saldana's character only ever shot people with her arrow or was screaming/crying with grief. They turned such a strong character into like some kind of damsel in distress but with occasional killing sprees? It was odd.Spider's actor was okay? It seemed like this was one of his first movies, and some strange character choices were made. I wanted more from him overallI liked this movie, but some of the dialogue was strange, Katie's Eywa connection was never explained, it was too long, and the acting left a little something to be desired. Plus there wasn't really a resolution. Bad guy is still alive, Spider may be switching sides, and the random fish is still an outcast.Also it seems like a lot of the plot became about the fish which I honestly didn't really care about.Also why did Spider have dreads? Culture is not a costume for a movie. And it's weird that everyone was fine with viewing the natives as subhuman until someone (Jake) was attracted to one of them. Culture and knowledge was shared, and the movie acts as if this is a given. Of course the natives are friendly, but if they weren't would it hav been okay to kill them all?Also since when is it cool to put on someone's skin color temporarily? As like a fun little experiment? So strange, and odd that it's like normal in these films."
"Let's start from the assumption that you have re-watched Avatar 1 and that you enter with a fresh knowledge of the characters and the story, this film builds on the first part very nicely. Cameron, as far as the effects are concerned, fullfils his fantasy. The CGI in this film exceeded every limit, the underwater scenes bought me, the way of life of the Metkayina tribe and the Omatikaya getting used to it gives a nice adventure vibe and allows you to enjoy the masterful cgi. Jake and Neytiri are admittedly put aside, that's the impression I got, but it doesn't take away, but rather adds to the essence of the film, which is the importance of family and the limits to which a parent goes to protect his children. Now let's switch to ""people"". The return of Quaritch will definitely bother some people, but personally I like the return of the villain now in the form of an Avatar with the general's memories embedded. That colonist idea from the first part is spinning again, but now it gains weight. Namely, the Earth is ""dying out"" humans also need a habitable planet to which they will move in decades time give or take. However, we come to the question: ""How does humanity plan to inhabit and urbanize a planet where life is impossible without breathing masks, in hostile territory against both the Navi tribes and animal species"" will have to be clarified in the following parts if they plan to continue in that direction. Let's go back to the story, it is very simple, superficially done without any big plots and depth, but that's what the first part was like. The characters tho, idk what could be said, everything has already been seen, Neytiri remains wild and protective, Jake now faces the role of both the leader of the tribe and the father figure, the kids mostly played their part well, some more, some less, definitely the most interesting character is Kiri. Action fans are definitely not left behind, the last hour of the film offers sequences that are hard to beat, mixed with effects, you get the impression... Could the time have been shortened by lets say 30-45 minutes, definitely, but the pleasure would be weaker. The fact that the production of the next two parts requires 2 billion dollars to break even is just an indication that Cameron is putting all his cards on the table so that these films will leave a big impact on the mainstream media and mainly on us viewers. The film, ultimately, could have been done better in terms of the characters and the story, whether these 13 years were worth waiting for, it is questionable due to the fact that many have forgotten about the first part and the hype was not so present, the same premise applies to Top Gun Maverick. It is recommended to watch in 3D on the largest possible screen, because in terms of effects, this is a once in a lifetime experience that you will not regret for 3 hours of your time. The third and every part until the end of saga must build up the story and characters, there must be some depth some building up of the characters through experiences, difficult decisions and so on. That's it from me, I wish a good time to everyone who will watch this movie during the holidays, greetings."

"Avatar: The Way of Water directed by James Cameron, is the sequel to Avatar (2009)This film is not easy to get into with interesting visual effects and complex storyboard with natural themes, metaphorical storytelling and social message to the audience about the environment, humanity, (Shakespeare) Etc...I give this film a 9/10 because it is a artsy film with a message.(0h, someone loses a hand)

"The movie is great in the beginning and the end. The middle of the film is extremely boring. One of the main character's son talks to a whale for the for a quarter of the film it is like it's his entire character arc. The drama between the tribes was boring, it is like they are in the suburbs.The end was somewhat satisfying. Generally a good film compared to the other trash films out there. So if you have kids or a family it will be a good one to watch.There is one scene where a human loses an arm though. (not graphic) That I thought was quite blizzard and parents should know that going in."
"It's not perfect but it's not bad at all, it's visually wonderful, it shows how James Camarón manages to captivate the viewer, with a story (in my opinion much better than the first one) that is slow at first in some small parts of the film, but he tells it in an excellent way and also with a lot of humor, and he concludes it in a moving and satisfying way. Something that also stood out are the beautiful visual effects that in my point of view seemed so real throughout the film. Something that I kind of didn't like is that in both movies (avatar 1 and 2) a different story is told but with the same enemy, I hoped that this new story could change that, but I come back and say the story seemed very good to me. In conclusion, the movie is enjoyable and very good, it met all my expectations and left me eager to see another Avatar movie."
"When you're a movie director known to have raised the bar of excellence, known for depicting beautiful worlds through every scene, known for directing the highest grossing movie of all time... is it possible to keep raising the bar?A whole decade has passed, filled with improvements in the field of technology, as it is clearly seen in the even better cinematography and CGI.This time lapse is reflected in the film's setting, where 10 years have also passed, welcoming everyone with even more astonishing opening scenes and a renewed sense of magnificence.However, time is rarely kind...The script is still quite simple to follow, yet the addition of many new characters provides a good base for weaving all sorts of stories in future movies - as suggested by the many plots left unanswered.Values are also quite universal, ranging from the importance of family, love, respect for nature which surrounds everyone and... curiosity.A collection of emotions and concepts, which allows for a story to be told through images and a technique: 3D. The world is in fact clearly depicted to immerse the viewer in it: filled with colours, lights, creatures and sounds, lulling the viewer in a continuous dance between scenes of dialogue (24 fps) and adventure (48 fps).Pandora is once again endangered and the movie is ultimately centered around a new concept: to save life, you need to love life. Humans clearly become the new enemy: a monster moved by arrogance and pride, who claims all with no knowledge of it; a creature able to create great beauty and destroy it at the same time.Which side are we on? Clearly, the one who appreciates another good movie."
"This movie is very entairtaining and amazing because there is action and turnarounds so for me the film isn't lousy .The character's are very funny and catchy because they are often fighting etc...
This film start's with a flashback of dad with his son who are fishing and is finish wit the last of the playback when the son fishing like his father .The movie talk's about the rivality of the main family and the second tribe of avatars . There is many twists and i love it !The film lasts 3 hours but it wasn't annoying so if you are not patient you can't watch the full movie because you had to wait the best times on this film
I watched this film in 3d so it was weary for my eyes and I had to remove my glasses .In conclusion this movie matched my expectations !"
"Normally I find it hard to handle movies that rely heavily on CGI for creatures, animals or humans as I cannot get rid of an unsettling uncanny valley feeling and unnatural body/face movements. But Avatar managed to create stunning visuals that didn't give me this vibe, truly impressive. Na'vi face animations still feel a bit cartoonish and exaggerated to me at times, and I guess actors have to emote more for better motion capture, but it wasn't very distracting, and the technology has noticeably improved over the years. Overall, the technical aspect of Avatar is amazing, though it did feel more like watching a animated movie, which isn't necessarily bad.The low score I give is purely plot and dialogue related. Script seemed extremely low effort given the budget and runtime. Better writing would have made these movies an instant classic, but unfortunately has always been the weakest point of the franchise since the first Avatar.Many reviews cover weak writing already in more detail, so here is what I personally didn't like the most:Three climaxes... Guys, perhaps there's a context where it is good, but a movie ain't it. This sort of thing resets all your emotional involvement over and over, so you stop caring. On top of that they were exactly the same: characters kidnapped - rescued - kidnapped again. I thought the movie was over when the main good guys won the first time and were hugging with narration about family. This first ending was the one that made the most sense too as it included everything built up prior - whale, water tribe, etc. Why did you keep going?? If the movie ended there it would have been so much better. But all other characters outside the main group disappeared out of nowhere, and it kept going for another 30+ minutes...Same boring villains. I do not mind the cartoonish nature of villains, but these guys had really nothing going for them since the first movie & have negative charisma. Calling now the redemption arc of the main bad guy who survived (again).Cringe dialogue about FaMiLy straight out of Fast & Furious. Nothing wrong with family, obviously, but Pixar and Disney have better written messages with more nuance and soul about this in animations for kids.3 teenage boys who were friends just saying ""bro"" to each other when interacting, it felt like it was 80% of their dialogue together. Is this really how people talk?Death of older brother you could see a mile away since he was getting the least character development and screen time, which made me not care about it when it happened.Overall, the sibling dynamic was super lazy - behaved down to earth one, one who gets in trouble, odd one and a small cute one.Scenes around how Jake and his family were discovered by bad guys were pretty stupid, and helicopter thing is never addressed by anyone. It felt like writers had to dumb down the characters because they couldn't come up with anything else to start wrapping the story up.In a movie full of teenagers Jake Sully manages to be the most annoying character. I don't remember his personality from the first movie and don't remember hating him, but this time around he sure was the worst of the protagonists.There are some good scenes, and I liked interactions with the animals and the world. I think there is a better movie inside this 3+ hour monstrosity. But for some reason the authors couldn't let go of some things they should have. If they did maybe fewer people would have needed a toilet break."
"The film has enormous potential, unfortunately some plot choices have been made which have led to inevitable tram holes.From a visual effects point of view it's obviously flawless but that can't make up for the rest.There's to many things that not have an answer, for example:
which is the sort of the forest village?-what happened to the precious metal that everyone wanted?-why water villages are razed to the ground and no one thinks to ask the scientists of the original village?I don't know it almost seems like a film in its own right which, thanks to a very lame apology, has been given the title of avatar."
"Avatar: The Way of WaterMy personal opinion of this movie is that it was enjoyable, although it had some flaws.The graphics of the film were really good, they were amazing and breathtaking. The characters themselves were also rather interesting and entertaining.One more thing not to be missed is the voice acting of the actors, for example during the battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, Neytiri's screams after her son's death felt realistic to me - I was really impressed by it.The plot of the movie was the less impressive thing for me.I was sometimes really confused about what was happening, because of the movie's fast scenes changing.In the end I think that I could recommend this movie to others, perhaps they'll enjoy it too."
"A great movie, full of well researched people group, lots of great storylines of family, honour, loyalty, love, friendship and emotional roller coaster ride
The post production would of taken hours and hours of work.Weta digital are amazing at what they do.I will be seeing it again when goes onto Disney+
Awesome storyline I wonder where they go for the 3rd one?Full of Blue people and semi green people.It was great watching it in 3D to.Watched some behind the scenes work very amazing technology used to make this.Thanks for the great movie James Cameron and team and the many businesses and people who poor there soul into this movie!"
"The movie is too long, with editors not pushing back enough. Other than the simplistic plot that clearly is setting up for Avatar 3, the love that was invested into this movie is a theater ""must see.""The original is better in that it is concise enough to allow for repeat viewings. Story was simple enough to fit into a one-off movie. This movie shot itself in the foot by making the run time so long that (1) less screenings can occur per day + (2) no one will come back for a repeat viewing b/c it is so long.Still an amazing movie. Definitely needs to be seen in a 3D theater, just like the first movie."
"Though Jake Sully's children enjoy spotlight in the movie, the script shows them getting captured repeatedly by violent killers and being thrown in life threatening situations. My 9 yr old was distressed through the movie. The obsession to keep Sully's character alive for further sequels sees a violent death of one of his children, life threatening violence against another child. C'mon a family movie depicting something this gruesome! In the end it was a sigh of relief that it was over. Guns and knives pointed at children or being used by children/on children is not the idea of a family movie IMHO."
The happy magical natives are invaded again by the Big Bad-ass shrewdly evil and morally corrupt military with zero conscience or empathy. No nuance. Wildly unrealistic and excessively violent duels lasting 10-15 minutes where in real life just one single such blow dealt would be fatal. Crazily unrealistic fights where countless bad guys get killed but miraculously not one of the good guy's family hardly get a scratch... Ho hum. So tired of this template!The special effects were fantastic. And the prolonged scenes of underwater vistas in 3D was beautiful. But the story was so two-dimensional and predictable.
"Like this first film the visual effects are spectacular but the story is a lot more bland. The first hour is just a rehash of the first film except underwater. They even go through the exact same ""bonding with a wild animal sequence""Like the first film as well, Sam Worthington is a incredibly bland actor, which is a big problem when he is effectively only doing a voice over.The plot of the colonel having downloaded his memory to be saved in case he died is also incredibly lame. It's like a 13 year old boy was asked to create a story on how they could bring his character backThe colonels feral son is another unnecessary plot line and the colonels attitude to him is completely inconsistent with his character.The biggest issue is the run time. Some films need a three hour run time simply to get everything in. This could have been properly edited by at least an hour and nothing would have been missed out. Three hour films are not epics just because they are three hours long. It's simply poor editing and is something they should consider for the third part. Marvel should also take note of this."
"Looks fantastic but the dialogue leaves much to be desired. A switch from subtitles to English very early on is crow-barred in which allows us to skip reading but let's the script revert to American English. But the accents are still ""alien"" which makes no sense.Plotwise the film relies on characters from the original, which provides familiarity, whilst introducing new aliens who live near/in the sea.Whilst the underwater scenes are genuinely spellbinding, the attempt to use the next generation as main characters gives a much less serious feel. Characters are introduced with insufficient or confusing explanation.When an alien species youngster asks ""Are we there yet?"" you get the sense of how low the scriptwriters have aimed. Disappointing."
"It's beautiful! You're almost expecting David Attenborough to start narrating.You will find yourself being over critical because the length of time the film top to make and obviously the very black and white nature of the audience.The story is way deeper, at times a little slow but there is plenty of visual effects to make up for it.At the end of the day there is nothing else out there remotely close to this film in 3D.Will the film work at home, probably not....but as a cinematic experience it's up there with the best visual films ever made and the best ever in 3D.What a shame people are already going to the cinema ready to criticize the film."
"Pretty predictable and boring.Beautiful filmed, but a very much predictable action movie.As part one was very beautiful and surprising, the sequel is very much the same story.With the same big guns at the end and the same storyline.Also the same lover stories as in the first part.Think they should have better watched Star Wars and make a movie more in line with that films...
The filming is beautiful and the message is also very clear.We should take much better care of the world!!If we don't do that and keep hunting every animal and using up Mother Earth, things will kit end well for us."
"There is some tendency when something is delayed for whatever reason people seem to start to expect it will turn out extremely good and they will be blown-away or something.Truth is that the movie turns out what it's planned to by its creators and, in this case, an awesome movie in its ranks. Yes, it's not some deep mental stuff with a thousand meanings, but neither is the first one.The movie is indeed long, but personally i didn't feel it at all, the action is engaging and with a fast pace, there is always something happening and you definitely don't feel like ""watching your clock"" for the movie to end.It has it's ups and downs, in my opinion, just like every other movie out there. People will always find something to hook on, but my overall advice if you are a fan of these fantasy types - definitely watch it. It's suitable for children, so you can watch it with your whole family over dinner or whatever, it's an amazing movie."
"The first Avatar was different to anything at the time. The world's created by the CGIs were just amazing.Now, we have the same idea repeated with a very boring story and rubbish plot. The CGI is still brilliant but it is not exciting..The story is so weak, predictable and an idea seen in 100s of movies. I could summarise it in 2 minutes, the film stretched it over 3 hours.As for the wonderful images created for this film, it would make a great screensaver (if you old enough to know what I'm talking about). But is this why you want to watch it!At the end of the movie my 14yr old son looked at me and said : is that it! That was waste of time.... Glad it' was not only me.."
"A flick about a coward that is running from his problems and bringing death and war to wherever he goes. Blue man's kids befriend whales and whales and blue men come together to give the American military yet another crushing defeat.Each character has a different English accent. The Carribean accent, a Scottish accent, and even a spun out wook accent.This flick has decent visual effects but nothing like the first one. The plot is bland and much of the movie consists of typical drawn out shoot-em-up scenes. The movie goes back and forth between nature and fight, nature and fight, nature and fight. The nature scenes are almost identical to the first Avatar except they happen underwater and not in the forest. The plot point about killing the big whale things and harvesting their brain pee that makes humans almost immortal was glossed over but should have been expanded. Even if this plot line is a direct rip off from the book ""The People in the Trees"", it would have been more interesting than the battle scenes with the military wannabe tough guys.There is also a scene at the end in which James Cameron tries to give homage to Titanic, but even that scene felt like an unoriginal regurgitation of an iconic movie moment from 1997.This occurs at least ten years after the events of the first movie yet the American military is still full of idiots that have made no headway into diplomatic relations with the blue people. I guess the failure of the American military is probably the most realistic thing in the plot!The 3D effects are similar to what we saw 13 years ago. You'd think that there would be a marked and noticeable improvement in this technology in 2022.It could have easily been two hours. No need for extended and boring battle scenes that add nothing to the plot or the 3D viewing experience. I can't believe James Cameron is turning this into a franchise. What's the third one going to be about? Jake Sully moves his family to the mountains and the film will be filled with trying to tame enormous moose like creatures?"
"I definitely recommend this movie. It has amazing visuals and beautiful references to nature. However, the plot follows really old fashioned stereotypes, with cringy moments such as 'father protects children' and women being shown as overly emotional.Also it makes no sense that the army disappears in the end leaving the poor family to fight on their own. The entire army was there fighting and then suddenly not a trace of them.I also don't think it was necessary to kill one of the children. It felt like they just ran out of ideas closer to the end and started putting random typical Hollywood things in, like killing the good ones and then getting everyone else to revenge. But everyone was already doing a good fighting and this just extended the movie with no real value added."
"It is a 3h long movie, but I loved it because it took its time to show us the world and didn't feel rushed, which is rare today.While maybe the main plot was not fully developed (like, I didn't understand what was exactly the conflic about and didn't remember much from the first movie), it really took its time in immersing us in the beauty of Pandora. For that, seeing it in 3D is essential, there are moments in which you feel you are there.I especially wanted to see the movie because it was going to show underwater shots and, yeah, it didn't disappoint. I am freshly freediving (diving while holding your breath) certified and it's accurate enough. I highly suggest seeing on YouTube 'One breath around the world' by Guillaune Nery, they are real shots and captures the magic you can experience while freediving.Yeah, the bad humans are simply bad, but honestly, it doesn't take make much to make that believable. I mean, we are currently destroying our environment for lesser reasons than in the movie. We are cutting trees and we are killing the seas and oceans. Personally, I think it would be a poor world or universe if most of what we are surrounded from is man made. I doubt that we can create as much diversity as nature and diversity sparks the imagination and new ideas. Without it, I think we would be missing out and essentially become dumber.I love the sci fi genre, and Pandora might seem cheesy with its weird collective consciousness, but I think it's the answer for humanity, something that can be made reality someday through technology. Otherwise, we will just keep spreading our cancer throughout the stars, consuming everything and always being at the risk of self destruction because of our, let's call it, chaotic side. A some kind of collective consciousness that connects all life would raise us up from ignorance and would make living sustainable truly possible. It would unite us, being able to withstand threats, while also preserving what has been there before us.So, yeah, it's worth seeing. There is no other movie that immerses you like this in a fantasy world. That's worth 8 stars."
"Everyone seems to agree that the visuals were breathtaking and out of this world so there's that. I think its important for many people to read up on what Camerons been saying in reference to the next few movies. This is the first sequel of many and the introduction of one of the tribes. As the story continues and advances the viewers will be introduced to more tribes and more regions of Pandora. His ultimate goal is to expand the world of Pandora and I think he's done a wonderful job thus far. I see that many people aren't too happy with the story yet, and again I mention that it's important to note that there's much more to the story we haven't seen yet. I'll wait until the third or fourth movie come out to actually start judging the storytelling throughout the movies."
"Vapid, plotless, awful acting, and pretty to look it, some of the time.Once again, this franchise has no business, like the Kardashians, in being relevant, bearing the need for a sequel, or having half the revenue it does.A complete waste of 3 hours of your life. It just doesn't have ANYTHING new to say. It's literally the same story, with water added. It's like the script was written by a 16 year old, as one reviewer put it before I.Save your money, save your time, go nap at home and watch something on Apple TV, or just watch the National Geographic channel for 3 hours while half asleep, and you will understand what I mean. I wanted this to be different, I did. It was not, to say the least."
"I am thrilled to say that ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" exceeded my expectations and is a visual masterpiece. The film picks up where the first one left off and takes us on a journey to an even more mesmerizing Pandora. The world-building and special effects are absolutely mind-blowing and once again, James Cameron has pushed the boundaries of what's possible in terms of filmmaking.The action set pieces are also incredible, they are thrilling and I found myself on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film. The addition of ocean creatures was a great touch and it was a pleasure to see the variety of new life forms that Pandora had to offer.The performances were also fantastic, Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana once again deliver strong performances as Jake and Neytiri and it was great to see them reprise their roles. The new characters also added depth to the film and it was great to see a new perspective on Pandora.The story was engaging and kept me hooked from start to finish. It was a bit slower than the first movie but it gave the audience a chance to fully immerse themselves in the world of Pandora. The themes of family and protecting one's home were present throughout the film and it was a great addition to the story.Overall, ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" is a visual feast and a cinematic masterpiece that should not be missed. The film is a must-see in theaters and I highly recommend experiencing it in 3D. I would rate it an 8/10, it may not be perfect but it's a wonderful addition to the Avatar franchise."
"I want to love this movie, I really do. After 13 years there was plenty of time to write an awesome sequel to the first movie. I was 13 years old back then and was blown away by the magic and story that held together the first movie, but this movie felt hollow compared to the first one. Story-wise there wasn't really anything new. They kind of tried to take off from the point where the first one ended, but with some corrections to the story. It felt like many moments of ""maybe we shouldn't have ended Avatar 1 like that, so let's correct it with some stupid non-backstory nonsense"". One of those is the whale brain stuff that doesn't let humans age, which suddenly exists: what happened to unobtanium, the main reason for them being there? Just because there's no massive unobtanium trees underwater equals a stupid reason for new stuff to exist?Then the characters. Miles Quaritch shouldn't have returned the way he did. He was the original bad guy who absolutely hated the Na'vi, which was his villain story. Him speaking to people about betraying the human race did the job right on his part, so I somewhat see the irony in him becoming one, but I don't like it and it just doesn't fit into the story. Also, why would he, the badass colonel who kills and murders without thought, suddenly care about his son he's never seen before? He should've stayed dead and someone else should've taken over his role as the main villain. I'm not really rooting for the humans anymore, which had some interesting backstory of survival on an alien planet.Next to the small changes in person arcs, there are way too many story resemblances to the first movie, just everything is done underwater this time. Those resemblances might be hard to spot if you haven't seen the first movie a few times, but they are quite obvious when you did watch it like 15-20 times. From the colonel sipping his coffee and saying: ""He thinks he's one of them"" to the giant fish trying to kill Lo'ak in the corals, referencing to Jake being trapped in the woods being attacked by the Thanator in the first movie. Even the point where they get saved by a 'bigger fish' is way too obvious on my part. The lab fighting with avatars to the fires and machines running down the forest. From the whaler boat 'planning'-scene to the Na'vi speech-before-fight scene and even the catch-your-mount scenes, it just all felt the same and seems to be a reference to the first movie. I'm not sure if that was the whole point, but then I have to ask, why?Don't get me wrong, I gave this movie 8 stars because it was a visual stunning experience and I'm just happy I was brought back to Pandora after 13 years. I just hoped for more for the story."
"It is hard to believe that makers of such a magnificient movie as Avatar come out with a sequel which is such a drab and a disaster.Unlike the first one, which contains amazing unravelling of an innovative concept and the unfolding of the story to go with, Avatar 2 contains nothing new. The theme is simply the lineage of the original villain trying to take revenge on the hero and the hero fighting it out and suffers some losses in the process. Theme for a very ordinary Masala movie with nothing innovative.The last 45 minutes is a torture to watch as they have dragged it on and on and on and on. The hero's side keep killing the villains who are about dozen and odd, but the villain's side people keep surfacing again and again to attack hero's side. There is no sense for numbers and the story simply doesn't progress in the last 45 minutes with meaningless fights repeated on and on."
"The movie is worth watching in 3D. The visual graphics are so beautiful to watch. The storyline isn't outside typical Hollywood formula. But the story is reinforcing family values, sealife preservation and that makes it an overall great movie. Humans should take responsibility of destroying world's environment and I enjoyed that they were stopped from doing so yet again just like in the first one. I watched the first movie after I watched the 2nd one and would say I liked the sequel more. I have preteen child and the sequel was a great family movie for us to enjoy together. I believe some storyline like Kiri's wasn't discussed thoroughly leaving room for the 3rd sequel."
Fell in love with the characters and the animals. I especially love kiri and her connection with eywa and grace! And sigourney weaver returning!I loved loak and his connection with payakan.. and tsireya!I would normally be bored by such a long film but it seriously went by quickly and was so captivating. - although i did feel that the final battle scene was a little long-winded.Wasn't a fan of jakes hair. He wasn't serving dilf like i wanted him to.Also i hate spider. And why was there a small romance hinted at with him and kiri??? Literally get away from her. And they are literally like cousins? The fact that he was holding her hand at her brothers funeral as if he didn't just save the man who is planning on killing the entire family... and he just went back to them like nothing happened....
"I enjoyed the 1st film. I found this, so disappointing. I took my daughters who wanted to leave after 1 hour.Script and dialogue terrible and patronising. Convoluted clichéd story. Unwatchable apart from the amazing 3d visual effects but the excitement wore off very quickly.I didn't care about any of the characters or what was going to happen at the end! It was so predictable good vs evil rubbish that Hollywood has pushed onto us for so many years, Ive had enough of it.We need more originality and character development.One of the worst films I've seen. I can't believe they could not come up with something more interesting after 13 years!!"
"After watching 2022 Avatar while paying my full attention and focus I had experienced a terrible 8 hour lasting headache, with periods of brutal pain that took me close to losing consciousness. I've learned later that it's a common reaction because of the technology used in production, the motion effects and, I would like to emphasize, because of the 3h long screen play!Unlike the first Avatar, the story is predictable, mainly because it's pretty much the same...only to be spiced up by - take a wild guess!! - the bad guy who returns for revenge. This is the ""in your face"" plot.Humans - ironically called ""the sky people"" - expose and exercise, once again, their native lack of perspective, their native lack of understanding and, what else (?) considering the relation between these aspects, their brutal and extremely violent nature.Aren't there already way too many movies on the subject!?Somewhere lost among overwhelmingly unnecessary details the ""not in your face"" plot is essentially, again, about humanity's obsessive need for ""resources"" and the insatiable appetite for the ""holy dollar"". Not other currencies but for the specific, one and only buck - an exchangeable piece of paper forever supported and sponsored by notorious seas of blood spills and...God himself.This time mining for a juicy mammal's brain gland that has the power to stop aging per 1g, off course, by killing and wasting the poor animal, we find, again, that the sky people's ethics could not lift higher than a frog's knee, that humans have an intrinsic drive for humiliating others (to be read as those who belong), for setting on fire and blasting everything around them, shooting randomly and killing anything that would move against their extremely narrow minded perspectives.Other themes touched by the movie are: adolescent friendship based on bulling, un-obedience, fashion, inter-racial and inter-cultural bonding, family and neighboring values, win-loss-win etc.In total opposition with the permanent state of awe experienced watching the 2009 Avatar, this one left me mind-broken, haunted by a simple, yet recurring, question: why do people spend so much money, time, effort and resources to produce nothing more than, as for me it is, a piece of crap?"
"Visually very interesting! Although there is no clear story, the movie is mighty!!! Advice, experience it in the cinema, biggest possible screen ,because it is an amazing visual experience! For me, this is the best ""visual"" cinematic experience after ""1917"". The movie is really worth the 192 minutes and the ticket money you spendThe movie's only drawback is that there is no story that draws you in, engages you in the atmosphere of the movie, attaches you to the characters, and moves your feelings! And the events are semi-predictable! Despite the weakness of the story, the movie has some good feelings and a comfortable ending.I don't know if this is intended by the movie or not, but I personally received a message from the movie entitled:
I can't save my family by running away!In terms of the story, if I rate it out of 10, I would give it a 5, or maybe less, had it not been for my love for the end of the movie. But the movie is 10/10 in terms of fun and visual creativity, very creative visually. 8/10 in terms of characters, acting, dialogues, music, etc...In general, the film proved to me something I was previously convinced of, that films can be powerful without telling stories, but only on condition that messages are delivered! My overall rating for the movie is 9/10, for the fun in it."
"The 3 and a bit hours flew by. It does help to know this forms part of a bigger volume but still, it's a standalone beautifully imagined world and I loved it.Entertaining and emotional at parts, my only real criticism is the highly unlikely use of 'bro', 'cuz', 'dude' and other such terms in a galaxy, far, far away in the 26th century. That took me out a little bit, but nevertheless, well worth the time commitment and I'm pleased ignored Mark Kermode. I might do that more in future, and I'll certainly as excited for the next one as I was for this. Just hope JC doesn't leave it so long next time :)"
"Visually its stunning and easily one of, if not the, best looking movies released in a while.The story felt a bit all over the place some times but i suspect it tries to build A LOT for the sequels and some sceens drag out a bit to long, underwater reef chase at the end so i fell like it dosent need to be as long as it is, that being said watching it in cinemas I didnt realized 3h had passed when the credits started to roll but i think it will be different when you watch it at homeOverall it's a beautiful movie with an okay story that i fell might change whit the sequels, if thats for better or worse we can only wait and see."
"Fathers to sons and sons to fathers... James Cameron has proved that kids can save their fathers and it's all about balance.You need to take care of the creatures arounds you so they will take care of you.I think this movie won't make so much money as the first one but this is not a reason for you not to enjoy this masterpiece and it's visual creation.You need to feel the cinematic universe around you and to enjoy the music, the visuals, the story, the words,etc... Make yourself home.. feel that you're living with them and I'm sure you will enjoy this movie as much as i did.I hope you will."
"Avatar: The Way of Water is a phenomenal sequel that wisely chooses not surpass the original in scale and instead offers a more intimate tale focusing on revenge and the struggle to be a good father whilst still delivering some truly awe inspiring set pieces and advancing filmmaking technology like never before.Also, as it is well documented that it's supposed to be part 2 of a multiple film saga it's so damn refreshing that the film feels so self contained. It barely sequel baits, focusing exclusively on this story and has surprisingly genuine stakes as no one truly feels safe or guaranteed to make it out alive.Sam Worthington gives a better performance as Jake Sully this time around, with his character showing more maturity and a stoic nature. Zoe Saldana doesn't get as much to do this time around but still has her fair share of emotionally powerful moments.Stephen Lang as Quaritch was one the best parts of the original and here he somehow manages to be even better, bringing more of the expected ruthlessness and tough exterior as well as showing a more human side to the character that's unexpected but really works."
Wonderful sea scenes. CGI sometimes remember PS4 games. There are few action scenes if compared to first Avatar. To much dialogues about family and they repeat over over and over. James Cameron should add a break during the movie to let audience buy more popcorn. I was wondering if next Avatar 3 will become a Broadway musical due the movie length. Don't forget you pillow and blanket for the next movie. This time James Cameron didn't bring a new experience just repeat the same idea from Avatar 1. He could show Earth and the real situation there. Questions without answers. Please read the script next time before a 3 hours movie.
"This movie was incredible to watch. The new and intriguing characters, the stunning visuals, the dynamics between the members of the sully family with the new tribe and even with each other, the emotions, the themes... the movie was collectively quite beautiful in many ways. However, the storyline was very similar to that of the first Avatar and the storyline for the 2nd was unfortunately difficult to follow; the main premise of it seemed to be for Miles to kill Jake for revenge, which is both unconvincing and less interesting than a new villain would've been. So with that, while the storyline was underwhelming, the almost near sheer perfection of the new characters and input of more meaningful themes, dynamics, and shots made this movie a bit better than the first Avatar, in my opinion. Definitely worth the watch and I think the length of the movie was justified (though could've been utilized better if there had been a different villain/storyline to explain a better plot).8.6/10 for me."
"I wanted to rate this 6 when I came out of the theater but like all bad movies I liked it less the more I thought about it.The writing in this film was chaotic. There is mixed messaging and no clear theme the way there is in the first movie. The characters motives don't feel authentic and there are a number of side plots that get lost somewhere in the gun fire, sinking boats, and explosions, none of which add anything to the viewing experience. Aliens and robots fighting on a burning boat is not exactly an original idea these days.The animation was certainly beautiful at times, except that every action sequence basically felt like a marvel movie, which I don't consider a compliment. You've probably heard a lot of buzz about the ""technology"" they developed to make this movie but it honestly just feels like Moana. Impressive ten years ago, but nothing special in the post-marvel era of cinema.Overall not worth the 3 hours and 15 minutes and I don't imagine myself ever sitting through it again."
"It's sad to see people moaning and leaving such negative reviews on here about Avatar 2. Sure, everyone is entitled to their opinion, although it seems a lot of people need to realign their expectations before seeing it. This is an extremely watchable, highly enjoyable film. Great to see avatar back on the big screen with both old & new characters involved 13 years on from the first.People don't go to see a film like avatar for ridiculous plot depths with crazy twists and turns throughout the duration. They are there to see a visually stunning epic that pushes the boundaries of cinematography and CGI to create an unrivalled pictorial experience for the viewer. Like the first film, the second one does just that.There is still more than enough content in the storyline, and the 3 hours seemed to absolutely fly by, which is always a promising sign. Happy scenes, emotional scenes as well as epic battles are included as in the original.As someone who doesn't go to the cinema much these days (mostly due to the lack of quality film releases), I can safely say that this was a trip I thoroughly enjoyed.Don't be a hater. Avatar is awesome."
"Avatar: The Way of Water is a sensory experience with a few conceptual flaws. The sound effects below the surface of the water are far from the crackling sounds in the air. This could be experienced by anyone who has ever dived into the sea. The ""Sky People"" are mostly at the peak of their power, because that is their job: to take over Pandora in order to drain its rich resources. But the natives of Pandora, this is their home. However, you will see in the movie only children and adults who are also mostly at the peak of their power, healthy and powerful. Nowhere in the movie you will see elderly natives, like pensioners among the human race. That does not exist in Pandora (at least, it was not been seen yet). It's all shiny and beautiful. The great visual effects masked all of that very well. The mass fight scenes are truly phenomenal, but to me as a viewer who knows the basic laws of physics, it seems unreal that the large animals ridden by the natives of Pandora can so easily avoid bursts of fire by simply maneuvering left and right.A female general who tortures members of her own race for giving away valuable information? I don't think so.This does not mean that the movie is bad. On the contrary. But from Mr. Cameroon and the rest of the team, I really expected a better story.If you want to check out how far the visual effects have come since the first Avatar, and/or you're in the mood to be glued to your seat for 3+ hours, I recommend watching this movie."
"I loved it! Seen it twice already! It's like a little slice of Heaven...if Heaven is underwater! Which...it just might be! Beautifully filmed! So worth the wait! The length of the movie is just right. There was a lot going on and the storyline was very well developed! So much creativity. I can't even imagine how the storyline was pulled all together! It's a wonderful film. 3D does not disappoint! You will go through all of the emotions! And there will cheering in the end! It's like Avatar 2, Heaven, Free Willy, Nature Conservancy, and Family Love all rolled into one epic film. Go see it! You will not be disappointed!"
"What a great work of James Cameron All one and only best Dir all time no can replace James Cameron.. no words comment is works.. i already watch 3 time but my mind still inside Pandora world... great work to all and all best to all work in movies.movie line was great ,, make great feel on water world.. i am wait for Avatar 3 ... non stop acion on screen. They dare to hunt sacred water animals in stunning sequences during which you have to remind yourself that none of what you're watching is real. The movie time 3hr 15min but full moment i was enjoy like i was inside water world.. next year Avatar3."
"Wow ! The visual effects , the action sequences were simply awesome ! Though movie was long yet not boring in any scene . Pandora world was simply breathtaking. Acting was superb. The movie was even better than the first part and the long wait for the sequel has been worth it.Saw the first day first show and kept thinking that how difficult it must have been to shoot the underwater scenes. Such an immersive experience overall. The marine life shown is so beautiful. James Cameron has once again done it ! Kudos to his vision !Wishing this movie all the success and i heard there are going to be total 5 parts to this movie. Wish him all the best for them ."
"Just wow. Absolutely amazing visuals. This movie has it all, jumps, laughs, tears all while been immersed in stunning visuals. Watch in 3D if you can. Thank you James Cameron for another masterpiece 👍I've read a lot of reviews that are not so impressed with the story. For me, I enjoyed it and thought it held strong throughout the movie. Sometimes the 3D experience and incredible colour's just took me away on a fantasy journey.I really enjoyed some wonderful meaningful dialogue too. Plus my very fidgety 12 year old sat still and quiet for 3 hours and 12 minutes hahaha. Yes it is that good. 👍"
"Movie is good but not as compared to first part.One time watch. Good grafics and good story but lack of binding element which was in first part. Takes long time to bind with story. Bit lengthy and loose some points. Over all a good movie.Nee characters and first part is must to watch else you will get nothing.13 years is a long time. Personally i dont think it will surpass the milestone which is set by first part. It will definately get a good gross income but will not set the standard, which is being set by the first part. Go watch this part if you haven't already. This is also a masterpiece.Good storyline.Thanks."
Obviously James Camaron is good with water. The movie is so cool when the under water motion capture technology comes into effect from the middle. The ending gives a half of Titanic vibes. Some scene transitions were jerky but okay. Some of the scenes were like video game animation because the physics were not so realistic but beautiful. The music is absolutely wonderful. Some under water scenes are stunning. It felt like living in Pandora for around 3 hours. Recommended watching English 3D version in a good theatre for best experience. There is not much of a story. It is very simple. Overall a great watch. Waiting for next part.I would watch again just for the beautiful CGI which is my thing.I am giving 8 outta 10.Have a nice day. Thanks 🙂
"I was very sceptical reading the reviews before I watched it but Avatar 2 does not dissappoint. Watched it Imax 3D and turned out we enjoyed the visuals, storyline, acting and all the actions. While some reviews did point some repeats from original Avatar, hey that is why it is a sequel. The movie was entertaining throughout, did not feel like 3 hours and had to say the new characters introduced did a good job. The storyline is simple, but to me it does a good job. Good values about family and these days movies focused on too much complicated stories it was too much; so Avatar 2 keep it simple (which maybe disappoint some viewers) and we family of elementary kids really enjoy. No LGBT message, no awkward scenes, no stupid jokes, very little f word (that seems normalcy in many movies nowadays), just good CGI, great values movie. Thoroughlg enjoyed it."
"Amazing graphics and totally OK movie for a date since it included cocktails and a loveseat. This movie resulted in so many questions after we walked out of the cinema though.What happened to the forest (first decor) and why did they leave it since they fought there before?Where did the Tulkuns go and is the outcast accepted again?Why did the water tribe disappear in the final battle? Or didn't they?Why does an Avatar uses slang like ""cuz"" and ""bro"" when he has no relation to our world?Why is Spider added to this movie?How does this concept work of human characters who are dead and still be present as an Avatar?What makes them suffocate under water and still live without things like brain damage? Since it has no effect, why point it out to the audience?Why do some Avatars have strong accents related to human cultures or backgrounds?"
"While I would say this is still a spectacular movie, I think the story is a bit too long and not compelling as Avatar 1. And, same as another movie fan, the first few words uttered after the end of the movie are: ""It's like a National Geographic documentary"".Yet, one very strong message I still get from the sequel is: ""human being by nature is so greedy and can't be satisfied, and it is indeed the biggest threat and enemy to the mother nature"", and I strongly believe this is true, though a bit sad.Anyway, a great movie before Christmas, but I would say it is not a must watch (and Top Gun 2 is now officially my most favorite movie in 2022!)"
"I CAN SEE SAIT
The best movie I have watched movie.Story of Movie is perfect and I really liked this movie.since I have been watching this movie and I'm telling myself this movie is the best movie currently on the world and ""I can this see"" I don't wanna the evil on the universe But People are too bad and will do nothing!I lokked the mirror and I'm telling myself
I'm going to superhero
Joke joke joke I never that said.I watched this Movie with Sait
Sait has watched that movie after he has told that me movie is perfect
I'm answering movie really but really amazing.I can see Sait I can see Sait!"
"It is 3 hours movie, but the events are pretty much just like avatar 1. A bad guy abducting a family memento, they lead them to this family. A bad guy is a must and events are sometimes make no sense. Like colonel chocked to death, but came back from death minutes at the end for them to have a bad guy to future at a next movie. The second point is that that they really missed on making the action with the animal and make it less about guns, like this is avatar not top gun. Overall, they tried their best to make it drama and romantic than action and the spiritual animal-fighting. Hopefully they don't make a third one because this was a long movie and predictable course of action."
"I really didn't want to bother to write too much for this film. I wish I could just write, ""awesome CGI but terrible storyline and way too cliche script"" because that's just what it was. I feel the Navi would be highly intelligent beings but this film reduces them to human like creatures who are happy to retaliate in the same way the humans instigate the fight in the first place. Its all about revenge fighting and very unintelligent creatures. I thought the characters were way to basic and cliche. It was annoying. Why do the kids use slang English language like ""bro""? I cannot fault the CGI. The visuals were always bound to be beautiful but what about creating more depth to the storyline since it was called The Way of The Water. Would have been great to expand on that a lot more. The storyline was like a bad American military or superhero movie with toxic masculinity at its worst! Bummer!"
"The plot wasn't too bad. Basically just a revenge against Jake. The visual is next level. Amazing water scenes. The world of Pandora looks amazing. Hopefully the next movie explore and explain more about Pandora! Overall, this movie is worth the watch. I recommend watching in 3d as well. If you like the first movie then you will like the sequel. I would give it a 10/10 if the plot was better. Like I mentioned above, the plot isn't too bad, it just could of been better but I see why the plot is what it is since it's only the 2nd movie. Literally the same bad guy. Maybe next movie they'll have a greater threat!"
"Avatar: The way of water has exactly same positives and negatives as Avatar. Extraordinary visuals make up for the weak story. As far as visuals are concerned, this is the best the world has ever seen. I was in Pandora. I went underwater. Everything was so real that I felt like I was beside jake sully all the time. Also the sound department did a fantastic job. When it comes to story, I'm disappointed. Avatar 1 has a very regular story, but the best thing was the script had zero loose ends. Every minute detail of the story was perfectly written. But I felt Avatar 2 story is outright failure. It had so many similarities with part 1 that i felt i was rewatching it again. Just like Avatar 1, the last hour is completely filled with action. But i was not emotionally connected to it. Every scene just happens as you expect it to happen. Dialogues in this film are as bad as they were in first part. I don't know why but, Pandora kids calling each other bro sounded so cringe and artificial to me. Don't expect much from the story, just enjoy the visuals in the best theatre possible."
"This movie was well put together. It's about family connection and connecting to nature and all things in it. The whale (avatar style )storyline was my favourite but also sticking together as a family was another one of my favourites. My son and I really enjoyed it!The graphics were amazing. The colours were fantastic. It was just as good as the first one.The underlying theme of the film that showcases parents protecting their children and vice versa is conveyed beautifully during the ending portions. To summarize, Avatar 2 is a greater cinematic experience that deserves to be watched on Imax 3D screen to witness the grandeur."
"I watched Avatar when I was a kid, and I was so excited when they announced that part 2 was coming out in December 2022. I made sure not to watch any spoilers and read any reviews about it, so I went in blind. Because of it, I really enjoyed the plot and graphics.I especially love how they showed the planet Pandora and the living things inside it. It became so alive, so real as I watched along. It felt like I was part of that world.The plot was also amazing. I felt a lot of emotions since certain situations were really similar to what already happened here on earth.I really hope part 3 is coming out soon!"
"13 years later since Avatar came out , which changed the way we look at Hollywood blockbusters, did lightning strike twice again ? Lets find out.Avatar The Way Of Water is a staggering piece of visceral filmmaking on both a visual level as well as an emotion level. Yes, the story is simple but that is not a negative as it will connect to more people from various classes of the society. The structure and world building is better that first part.Now coming to the visuals. We I went for the re-release of Avatar a couple of months back and believe me when I say that film still looks better than any other staple blockbuster that hollywood keeps churning out . And at the end of that film they showed an extended footage of Avatar the way of water , that blew everyones mind by how staggering it looked . The difference was staggering . (Please note : I went for IMAX for the re-release)
we knew going into this that this will be something special but boy oh boy I wan not prepared for this . The eyes. The skin textures , the underwater sequences look so so so (I cannot stress it enough TBH) real , so gorgeous and the 3D is so immersive , it almost feels like I was inside of an marine aquarium. It still staggers me how cameron & co made this so realistic. The HFR which shifts from standard 24 fps to 48 fps adds a whole level of smoothness and immersion.Now coming to the overall screenplay, I loved it . The emotions feels earned, there are scenes involving Nyeteri and kiri are brilliant ,Sam Worthington again wins in his act as jake but the biggest winner is Loak. The emotional beats that he has with a tulkun are some of the most touching scenes in the film.If you thought that the last complete hour of Avengers Endgame was bonkers , wait till you watch this .The last entire hour is like a recollection of Jim Cameron's greatest hits. Scenes of Aliens , TItanic and even Godfather are reminiscent in this .Another thing to note if you are going for an IMAX screening, The entire movie has been shot in the 1:85 full IMAX ratio which is the most immersive moviegoing experience IMO.They don't make films like this anymore , they just don't. This is why we go to the cinemas. James Cameron is one of the dying breed of filmmakers (along with Spielberg and Nolan) who makes films for the big screen for the EXPERIENCE.Watch this biggest and best screen you could find , preferably IMAX or Dolby Cinema. ITS ALL WORTH IT and trust me I am not even overselling this stuff."
"Today I saw this movie, it really felt like life has become meaningful, every artist has been brought alive as if this character is real, maybe no one will be able to make a movie like this. The story seems to be a bit long in the middle, but each and every scene is important, amazing feats which have not been seen till date. James Cameron and his entire team have done a great job, excellent vfx, and each and every underwater scene is awesome,
This movie will break all records, and will become the highest grossing movie in the world.It will take a lot of brains to find fault in this movie
My rating 9/10."
"Regardless of the format I saw Avatar: The Way of Water (Avatar 2) in, I was very impressed. Many films were released in the last year and there were many good ones. However, the visual aspect was impressive frame after frame. Every minute had a special feeling.With such a distinct quality, it is difficult to estimate which movies can top Avatar: The Way of Water. Do visuals change? Does format change? Which video elements change? What about any particular elements which hint at future growth?One thing is for sure, I hope that there will be an Avatar 3, Avatar 4, and Avatar 5. Why not? I will certainly be a fan."
"Absolutely beautiful film that was worth the decade long wait. I think i love it more than the first one, which is rare to top an already fantastic previous film. The graphics were stunning in 3D with a beautiful plot with new characters (Jake's kids) that highlights the importance of family, breathing, spirituality, nature, faith, etc. There was not a single time I was bored in this 3 hour long film. I even wished it was longer! There was the perfect amount of graphics, action, humor, etc. Definitely watch this film, in 3D!! I want to watch it again. It left me wanting more and excited for the next film. Please don't be afraid to this a 5 hour film lol."
"What happened to the water Na'vi at the end of the fight? Did they just bail on Jake and his family or what? They just disappeared. This seems like a big mistake from Cameron. How this can happen on that level of movie production?Story with that general rescued again on the end is similar with that little chat about pregnancy with tulkun whales. I didn't expect so shallow storytelling from director like Cameron.Colors are beautiful like in first movie but why so distracted with that fps? Movie in some moments hits you out from story. Then when you go back , question mark above your head. Hey where are they. They just been there in that fight moment ago. Big mistake. Really big mistake."
"The long wait was worth it and the high expectations were fully met: For me, ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" was a great and highly immersive viewing experience due to the spectacular effects, the richly detailed world and the multitude of engaging characters and creatures. I was particularly taken with the family ties of the Sully clan, which bring a lot of fresh air to the story: The characters of Jake and Neytiri's (adopted) children, as well as their relationships with each other, are sensitively and engagingly fleshed out. And watching the kids run wild in the beautiful water worlds was just a lot of fun!"
"At the beginning, I loved the direction towards the family dynamic along with their funny yet subtle relatable interactions. Especially when they meet the new tribe and the two dads eye each other! Nevertheless, all of that dissipates further throughout the film. My interest began to diminish, and it never came back. In particular, when we were shown the flashback via the mind of a sign-language-understanding, handicap, war veteran whale. The same whale that could be nominated for an Oscar due to it having the most screen time.Don't get me wrong, I love being imaginative and challenging the reality we are so used to. However, I can't help but to posses deductive reasoning within the confines of what films allows us to have. Here, there were to many plot holes and lapse of that reasoning, I couldn't trick myself any longer and lost interest.The rest of the film opens a lot of subplots but isn't able to close hardly any, and because of that, you get to feeling a lack of closure. I just wanted more of the same excitement and wonder I got from the beginning of this film and same I got from the first avatar. I give it a 5/10 sheerly due to its ability to submerge (no pun intended) us into its other worldly magical realm by means of stunning visuals and CGI."
"Loved it. The cgi itself is absolutely the most amazing thing I have seen on tv screen. The storyline was amazing, I thought I would hate the kids storyline but I absolutely loved it, I fell in love with the whole sully family and how it focuses on their journey. I don't understand why people did not like the dialogue but I absolutely loved it. I am such a huge fan of what they did here and can't wait for the others. I honestly wanted to see it again after watching for three hours right off the bat, that's how good the movie was. I loved how they introduced different cultures and how the others had to face some challenges adapting."
"While all the quality of the special effects which are of course abundant and detailed there's neither story nor character development maybe with an exception for the little human boy. Overall I couldn't get rid of the feeling that I'm visiting some sort of church meeting for 12 y.o. Kids: ""mother"" ""father"" ""brother"" ""sister"" ""nature"" ""refugee"" ""important"". A lot of issues described in the film in fact should interest most people but the writing is so unsophisticated and straight-in-your-face that one gets bored very soon. Motivation of the main villain is same as most of the modern franchises 'just because I'm evil'.Overall 5 out of 10 just because I liked the first movie when I was a kid and for the colorful picture."
"We have to see the beauty of this film, which is technically perfect. However I have a really hard time to hang on to the movie as there are elements that have pulled me out of the movie.First of all, I did not understand at what point all the Na'vis peoples began to speak perfectly English, I understant that it is necessary to make the film digestible, but an element of answer would have been appreciable. Especially since the colonel says he has to adopt their way of life and therefore adopt their language... that obviously nobody speaks anymore.Then Cameron brings the colonel back, claiming he made a backup of his memory just before the final battle of the first movie, Which is surprising at first when we know how confident humans were in going to fight the Na'vis. Besides, it's strange that if this technology exists in the avatar universe, it wasn't used to save Jake Sully's brother's mind before he died.It is also strange that humans no longer covet the Unobtanium that looked so precious in the first movie(which is the reason of the first confrontation).Finally, one may wonder where the Na'vi culture has gone: especially the respect for animals, at the beginning of this movie, Jake teaches his son to fish, he does not perform the ritual to shorten the suffering of the animal and allow him to return to Eywa. It is as if in about ten years, Jake managed to implant his culture among all the Na'vis, despite the fact that he is considered a demon by many Na'vi.Despite everything, the movie remains splendid and enjoyable and is probably 10 years ahead of the technique used currently, despite all the scriptwriting facilities used to advance the story. I definitely appreciated discovering the ocean, the Metkayina and the reef where all the beauty of this film lies."
"The way of water connects all things. The sea is our home before our birth and after we die."" Beyond the 3D visual spectacle that Avatar is, something we trust James Cameron to deliver, the franchise's beauty lies in its underlying spiritual arc and ode to continuity of life. Life finds a way. It evolves no matter the surroundings as love is transformative.Humans call the Na'vi 'hostiles and insurgents', when it is they who forcefully infiltrate and occupy their land. Despite its magical, fictional setting, Avatar is not devoid of socio-political themes. It addresses race, civilisation, takes a strong anti-military stand and makes a plea for environment conservation through its simple story of parents and children. A spectacular climax revolves around parents protecting their children and vice versa.From lush jungles to the gorgeous reefs... the action shifts from forests to the sea this time around and it's equally meditative and hypnotic. For over three hours you find yourself immersed in the enchanting world of an oceanic clan (Metkayina) or the reef people who give Sully and his family a refuge from humans. The sequel scores high on action and emotion. One is not compromised for the other. 'Happiness is simple. The Sullys stay together. This is our biggest weakness and our greatest strength,"" says Jake Sully and the story embodies that spirit. The tale isn't unique per se but the storytelling and visual excellence are otherworldly epic. Mounted on a massive scale, not once do you find yourself wanting to return to the real world.While the predecessor set the bar high for visual effects 13 years ago, the new film takes it a step further. Like the previous film, the director does not use 3D as a gimmick but uses it artfully to accentuate audience immersion in the world and story. Avatar: The Way of Water deserves be watched in IMAX 3D. It is the greatest immersive cinema experience of the year - world building at its finest."
"James always tries new tech. I get that but the tech isn't everything. As a picture i would love to rate 13 point but for script? I havent seen on the movie so that's why i gave 5.. If you really want to enjoy the picture you should choose bigger screen. But just want to spend your 3 hours? Better to go any cinema.. And also what an egoistical act... Okay you've made the Titanic, what a great movie that i've ever seen, but for real? Do you really have to sink the ship? Like the same... Omg! I hope you recover and will write nice script and make a good movie.. After the movie i just checked the new movie release date so im happy to see that we don't have to wait for another 13 years. Thank god Cameron! Thanks for the being savvy.. Whatever you still made tons of money. USE IT WELL!!"
"I have never felt that frustrated in any movie. Don't waste your time and money on this piece of junk. Don't expect anything good from this movie. The director must have lost his mind, didn't they guys check the final cut before release?No story, no plot, and nothing compared to the first Avatar. The first one was a piece of art and this one is just an unnecessary fart. A fart from another planet.Pros: The Name only
Cons: Everything from the beginning was so good to realize how stupid we were as audiences that we waited for something to happen, I'm sorry I'm not sure about the end because it was so hard to sit for another minute, my limit for tolerance has already been exhausted after watching the first half, but even the stupid commercials look more logical than the AVATAR."
"After 13 years a sequel final comes out. And don't you worry it wasn't one of those sequels that disappoint but quite the opposite. Bringing its unique twist and the audience into the movie yet again was wonderful to experience. Perfect everything and that's why its a must watch! I even made an account for IMDb just to make this review. The new characters, animals, setting and much more makes this movie different but similarly to the first one. Beautiful cinematography that makes you feel like you stepped into the Avatar world and right there with them. Loved the younger generation introduced to us in the movie and can't wait to see more."
"Visually amazing, but the same war is not expected...I dare say that its visual effects are impeccable and it will surely win more than one nomination for it.Likewise the soundtrack is absolutely wonderful and equally worthy of many nominations and awards.I love the development of the characters and especially the whole environment of the new characters with which it is easy to connect and identify.But definitely what I never expected was the continuation of the same war seen 13 years ago.For my taste, I need to tell a more solid story that will not revolve around the war already seen in such detail in the first film of 2009."
"First to get it out of the way, the movie looks stunning. Shows a lot of potential for the future of cgi.The story is simple, but effective and leaves room for visual story telling especially in the second act were we are introduced to the world of water.I also liked that the characters have different motives in this movie that makes them feel distinct.My only gripe in this movie is the character of spyder who was not given a clear goal for this movie and is only been used as a plot device to bring some more conflict to the story. I liked his character interactions with the commander, but he just hadn't had much cemetery with the rest of the characters.I really enjoyed this movie and I would highly recommend it!"
"I remember really enjoying the first movie including the storyline. Visuals were stunning of course, but so are Christopher Nolan's movies which he tries to shoot real scenes and use very little CGI.This sequel was dull and boring. Very repetitive scenes and some terrible dialog. I was seriously bored after about 1 1/2 hours and ready for it to just be over. Almost felt like I was watching a Pixar film.I ended up leaving tired, disappointed and with a stomach ache from eating way too much popcorn to entertain myself.Easily could have napped and woke up just for the end. I don't see the hype.. and can't imagine him making 3 more of these!"
"The alien things are all good because they are eco friendly and somewhat cultured. The humans are all evil because they use fossil fuels etc. Stunningly boring and every scene is predictable. The alien things will win all the time every time, the humans are useless. What's the point? You know the ending before the film even starts. And what was that character Spider? What was his purpose? Didn't he speak as though he was from california even though he has never been to earth? This is not as bad as Disney star wars as the new ""empire"" was completely useless. That's why this review gets a 2. It's Christmas and at least the main character was a strong male lead."
"Finally I see highest grossing movie Avatar's sequel Avatar The Way Of Water🌊 is in one word amazing. 2009's AVATAR was mind-blowing, now 2022 is awesome. The VFX & CGI of this movie were so realistic that sometimes it felt like watching a Pandora's Underwater documentary, it was real. The underwater scenes were very alive. What a wonderful way James Cameron presented a simple story with visual effects. He proved once again that he is one of the best. If you don't actually watch this movie in 3D, it is not possible to enjoy the wonderful work of its visual effects.There is much more for the next part i am so excited to see part 3 just waiting ⏳"
"Special effects 10 on 10.Story 2 on 10.This movie could have been one of the best movies of late. Maybe in the league of Lord of the rings but there is absolutely no story.You can go watch it in theatres only for the special effects. It will feel like snorkelling or visiting the aquarium. Other than that have no expectations. The weakness of characters especially of Jake sully and such a weak story was almost cringeworthy.I still have high hopes from Cameron and I am hopeful that this was a build up for part three where the kids become strong characters and there's a story around them.If so, part two would be forgiveable."
"People it seems are constantly looking for weaknesses in films these days instead of just trying to appreciate them and find positives. For the people saying the story is weak I found it quite enjoyable, with the movie addressing the first film and introducing its own characters and subplots. The film looked stunning and I look forward to seeing the next one. Most importantly I didn't feel like I wasted my money or time going to see it.Visually it was amazing and I feel it is worth seeing on the big screen so that you can appreciate the CGI as much as it deserves. Whilst the story may not be for everyone, if you liked the first film you'll probably like this one too I feel."
"I rewatched the first Avatar before seeing this sequel and it's still a good movie. Jake's character arc of learning from the Naavi and becoming one of them is compelling. He comes to understand how everything is interconnected and we see that Eywa is real and rises up to help her people fight against the invaders.This movie was not compelling on the same level. The visuals were stunning and I enjoyed the world building, but overall the plot was not as interesting or well paced. There were many storylines going at a time and I would've preferred for some scenes to be shortened or cut. Two new romantic relationships were being set up and I didn't feel very invested in the one between Jakes son and the daughter of the sea people's chief.One minor complaint I have is that the accents of Jake's kids felt inconsistent although this could have been intentional to show a blend of his and Neyteri's accents."
"I only hope that another episodes will be more interesting. Horrible dialogues. Terrible characters. The only saving for Avatar 2 were visual effects, which are amazing and giving you goosebumps all the time. Storyline isnt good enough. Half of the film I was badly bored. And there is just one plot twist repeating all the time in the movie. Not actually emotiomal. I was expecting a lot from this movie, but I will probably never watch it again. I find Avatar vol.1 better. The music from The Weeknd wasnt that bad, actually I think it was perfect fit for such a movie. There wasnt visible bond between nature and Avatars."
This movie is probaly one of the best I have seen in a long time. 3 hours long and I did not squint my eyes once because I did not want to miss a single second if this masterpiece. I love the return or Colonel Quaritch and the pararells between him and Jack Sully. I also love the reaction of Colonel when he sees how he died and he is out for revenge against the Sully's. In the first movie we only saw the wood tribe which was quite interesting but now in the second we see the water tribe and their story was fascinating. The visuals in this film was amazing. Neteyam's death was so sad. Seeing Jake and Neytiri reaction to their eldest son's death was so sad. And after Jake and Neytiri looking for payback. I also liked the action in this filmz near the end of the film Jake and Neytiri disputed some of the best combat I had ever seen.
"Special effects were incredible. Best I've seen.Story not bad but lacks the wow factor of avatar 1.American accents, ""cool"" slang and stereotypical whooping nonsense ruined it for me. It would have been so much better if they always spoke the blue dudes language with subtitles.Last 1/3 of it seemed like Cameron tried to tack on excitement by copying stressful titanic scenes.The setup for avatar 3 was a disappointment. It left things unresolved. A better ending would improve the film. Too bad studio greed didnt agree.3D was cool at start but you forget it's in 3D after 15min. Personally I'd rather not wear the glasses."
"The adventure back to the home of the Navi was thematically consistent with the first movie. Incredible how James Cameron took a narrative and built an amazing new addition.When watching this movie, you will be stunned by how big the world is. The graphics are simply stunning, I can't think of a great comparison, but I can think of a great contrast. Consider Aquaman: the underwater scenes at times seemed unrealistic and staged. You never get that feeling in this movie. Each scene has cares and considerations that made it unreservedly real.This movie also packs emotion. The flight of a family, danger, love, loss. You will walk away with a feeling of awe and wonderment."
"The storyline has some unexpected plots, but is simple. But James Cameron presents us a visual spectacle. Therefore I rated it with a nine. When watching it, it doesn't feel you're sitting for more than three hours. As the storytelling about the beginning was done in part one, James Cameron had more time to give us beautiful images of a wonderful fairyworld. From minute one till the end, it grabs you by the throat telling the story how it continues with Kake and Neytiri and again, the beautiful images. Also James tells us how important family and friends are and how we must be one with nature."
"Had little high hopes, but this sequel was disappointing one compared to the first part .The movie had many plot holes and the story line was very weak . This movie is all about a typical Hollywood action movie with Pandora VFX. They shows how Na'vi people start behaving just like homosapiens and even speak English mostly which did not sense.VFX was also mediocre in my opinion, nothing improved with newer technology not sure how this took 10+ years!! What disappointed me most was single geared story and it was so quick about not showing way of water life !Watching this movie reminded me of watching l last episode of games of thrones!"
"No regrets of waiting for more than 13 years this time. It's a great value for the small ticket price. Even though I didn't see it in IMAX, just a regular screen made it possible for viewers to concentrate and enjoy it. Although the story at the beginning is boring. But the work of images and graphics makes us unable to take our eyes off it at all. Outstanding graphics and design flow profound scenes For me, it's still considered mellow but not extreme. Sad, not very sad Excited, not super excited But in some scenes, it's extremely exciting. This is the best movie ever! I don't know what should i should say but 'Thank you for make my dream true'"
"Stunning CGI was definitely worth paying the extra to see on 3D IMAX. However;, With the 13 year wait and money that must have been spent on CGI for this film, it is a Shane that more effort was made ti deliver the full package.It is a shame they didn't write a better storeyline though. The film is almost a carbon copy storyline of the original film relying on very simplistic tweaks on the same theme.Would still recommend to see though but would recommend seeing at cinema in 3D IMAX to fully appreciate it.I know there is a third film coming but if I am
honest, I am now less excited due to the expectation of another weak storyline."
"Beauty, about beauty, and the great cinematic scenes make up for the story line- in my opinion. The storyline is not bad, it is just painfully unoriginal, feels a little like watching an marvel movie. Acting good, directed good (how could it not be), whoever had the role as head of photography should give then self a patt on the back beeing able to follow up the last film. Manuscript meh. And WHY DOSE the now to be crown prince say bro so god damn many times?! I got to say it feels a little forced. Like Bro, i got it you have a brother but my friends started counting in the last middle half and got to well over 20. Buzzfeed need to make a bro count asap. Over 20 of a word in 45 minutes is way to much, unless your watching a QT movie, then you got to cover your kids ear ever other secound. Final review: chills still comes when i think back at some scenes, manuskript absolutely, meah."
"It's the worst sequel ever. Doesn't make any sense, no build up of nothing not the characters nor the story. Of course the special effects are something but you need a plot.. those fishermen badguys were a joke, ""I can't believe I'm tied up again"" well so can't we!! The navi are suposed to have an intimate relationchip with nature and their land but oh we're sea people now and no one cares!? So many plot holes, so many forced action scenes, dude why? What was the point of it all? We already know humannity sucks, killing an alien whale for a flask of Juice? A bit much
Absolute waste of money, not mine for going but the one spend doing it. It's an awful awful nosense."
"Pandora is still as breathtaking as it was 13 years ago, the landscape and detailing still manage to leave the audience awestruck with its amazing scenes.This movie is a substantial buildup for the upcoming sequels as it doesn't fail to explain the lore and successfully makes a seamless connection of the significant events of the previous movie with either visual representation or a simple but manufactured dialog between characters.There are Plot holes(covered in the Arcs) and very convoluted characters, like Spider the Tarzan like a son of the 'Demon-Blooded' Colonel Quaritch. Who is very confused about what he wants to do in the movie, he jumps from helping his Dad to aiding the Sullys again and again, to finally saving Colonel in the end, for the sequels of course.Then there is the Daughter of Jake Sully, Kiri who is gifted in her abilities and has strong ties to the Spirit tree and the scientist which are not exactly explained. But she uses her powers in the right way to aid herself and her family.Graphics and Visuals: The visual aspect of the movie are outstanding, especially how every character is meticulously detailed to a point where even a single body hair looks amazing, but at the same time the landscapes look lacking and made in a hurry and could have been enhanced by more detailsI will focus on the film as arcs from here on out to focus on the fallacies that I noticed, be it logical or story-wise as most of the logic and direction of the story is controlled by what Jake Sully decides.The Forest ArcThis starts where the first part left off, The ""Monkey People"" are living in harmony without any alien threat and have adapted to the Human technology to a point that even teenagers of the clan are taught was to use Human weapons and communication technology, And when the Humans return the Na'Vi are able to mobilize and defend the territory even after Humans basically drop what cant be compared to Multiple Atomic bombs in the Forest.Even after this under the leadership of Jake Sully, his clan is able to strategically attack enemy convoys and defend the clan stronghold by successfully hiding in the Hallelujah Mountains, to a point that the Human strike group can't last for more than 10 minutes in the area.And even when the position of the camp is compromised the dragons attack any foreign elements and destroy them.And the most advanced Avatar group of 'Sky People' is almost killed by Jake and Neytiri without the help of anyone.But after this encounter instead of using all his leadership skills and his clan to defend his camp, he decides to take a voluntary exile to 'protect' everyone.This is very important to be mentioned as it should be in the mind of Jake to take any further actionsThe Journey of finding a New HomeSo the Leader of the clan that is clashing with humans for years and has a solid military background and used every element of the forest to defeat humans in the previous movie is now just useless?Then predicting a bigger attack from humans, Instead of rallying up the other clans of the forest and making a great Na'Vi army that is well apt to use the forest, the animals, and human technology.The Sea PeopleJake the master mind deserts the forest and goes to seek shelter from reef people who are primitive and use spears and crossbows to fight. These are basically small village tribes spread over a number of islands who are helpless to defend themselves even from a single unit of humans who are just using tasers and rifles unlike the warrior clans of the forest who can actually fight.But the Sully family stays with them and starts to adapt to 'The Way of The Water', by learning the ways of the tribe and what they do to sustain and learn to ride the local animals.The Tulkun ArcA sizable part of the movie is centered around the whales or Tulkuns who are the literal spirit animals of the sea people, and how Lo'Ak Sully, the second son of Jake Sully finds and tames a rough Tulkun who plays a role in the final fight.The Final FightThis is the final Encounter between Jake and Colonel Quaritch, who has held the kids of Jake and the Tribe leader of the sea people on a fishing ship. After killing the Tulkuns and luring the enraged tribe of the sea people. But after the initial fight between the fishermen humans and the tribe, they all disappear leaving the Sullys alone to fight the Colonel's unit with just the assistance of the Tulkun of Lo'AkAnd in this time, the hostages are freed and again captured on the sinking ship. In this attempt to free the hostage kids the Elder son of Jake, Neteyam is shot and killed.After this Colonel offers a hostage deal to Jake, where the colonel is alone against the whole Sully family and instead of killing him together, Jake the mastermind decides to fight him alone and his family who is apt in swimming underwater and holding their breath for a long time somehow manages to be stuck in the sinking ship this reminds me of scenes from a famous Romantic movie about a sinking ship, as Jake fights the Colonel and they both almost die by sinking just to be saved by their respective sons, and then the Sully Family is saved by Kiri Sully and the Tulkun to a bittersweet endingConclusion and Rating:8/10This is still a great movie and does not fill like a filler at all, every part of the long 3 hours is necessary for the lore-building for the next 3 movies, and if the logical fallacy is leniently looked over, the movie-making scene by the point of view of Jake. But it is far from perfection that most were expecting."
"The first Avatar was poetic and sent a message full of hope. This totally lacks storytelling, there is absolutely no surprise or inspiration in the script.Boomer macho style (men protect their family) wrapped up in a 3 hour long gun fight (did no one tell Cameron that more guns fuels more violence?).Thankfully the graphics are fantastic and beautiful, but to what end? What message is Cameron sending to viewers about society and its values? Is having your son killed what protecting your family means? And why play the Titanic ploy again with the sinking ship?Frankly, it seems everyone were too busy producing the graphics to think about the script."
"Avatar part 1 was a big time winner on all departments not just for its beautiful graphics but the magic that it created when mixed with a beautiful story line gripping the audience to their seats. The part 2 storyline was intentionally dragged and appears to be written in a motive of producing the next part and keep its franchise growing. Too many new characters and more number of scenes just planner to treat the audience visually and have them go ""wowwwww"". Hope all these are prep works to prepare for better future productions and I hope we get a better one.Anyway ready for the next part now."
"Lots of plot holes, lots of ""telling"" instead of ""showing"" and it felt like they didn't really knew in which direction this movie should go.The old characters don't even act like their characters. None of them has a single brain cell, except the whales. At one point it's just them being in a rebellion, then a family vacation/ travel movie, then a father son bounding movie, then a horse girl movie, then a Barbie movie, then titanic. Those are only a few examples.The worst think of all is that there is no real end result. The main problem wasn't solved, probably so they can have a reason to make a third part. The only moral of this story is to use birth control or get a vasectomy.But hey, it's pretty. I like how the coast people have a different anatomy then the forest people. The world building itself is so great. But the characters and the story itself makes it ""meh"".Sry not sry for the bad English."
"Its a good follow up movie reintroducing characters from the first one and exploring them a bit more, as well as introducing new characters that will be important to the story.I see a lot of different elements taken from this movie that come from other movies. If you're a movie buff you'll catch them right away, especially titanic.It's truly a good movie as well, the pacing is great, the action scenes are awesome, the romantic scenes are wholesome and the sad scenes are real tear jerkers.It's a movie about family, conection with nature and our spirituality.I really reccomend this movie, it's a hit of the century and I'm sure it will influence movie making as well as redefining what can be made with CG."
"My perspective: It is an incredibly important cultural work. Cinemetographically it is a masterpiece, beautiful. Every scene has some meaning. Seems like the first movie James Cameron knew he got everyone's attention and this one after a brief 20+ min recap of the first movie is entirely original, every scene has meaning.The main theme of the movie is a comparison of tribal humanity with modern society. It compares and contrasts western medicine, ideology, and purpose.The second main theme under that is the combating of the cognitive dissonance of modern society. On one hand we are destroying our planet, poisoning ourselves, and killing our persons. On the other, striving for betterment and simply more.The movies general feeling is that of being in Nature. There is also a magnificent analogy that takes place the last 45 minutes discussing the path to end this cognitive dissonance. A masterpiece. The 3rd and 4th are planned and will be an important cultural influencer changing the mentality of our relationship to our planet and even has the power to push the society to fix its idiosyncrasies in our relationship to our planet, the earth."
"Best film I've watched in a while. Didn't want it to end but did kind of drag on when they were on the big ship with the whale. The blue avatar guys look a lot more realistic this time round and overall it looked a lot better. Jakes kids were also a bit annoying as the film went on as they for some reason needed to say bro at least 3 times per sentence, also didn't like the socially awkward girl with epilepsy being voiced by a 73 year old, just didn't make sense to me. These reviews need 600 letters or characters so I'm going to waffle for the last 50 or so that I now need, overall very good film, bit of a shame that the older brother died but oh well.Cheers for reading the review 👍"
"This movie definitely is definitely worth waiting for 13 years!Another master piece by James Cameron😍
Absolute Marvel..
Beautiful story telling.Great Visuals..
Tons of emotions..
Each character is an hero!The Visuals literally takes us into its control.. Feels like we are living in Pandora's waters!One hell of a movie.Great background score.Awesome fight sequences..This one's Epic and is the best in the last 13 years of movies that i have watched..😍🔥🔥🔥Go watch in the biggest screen possible and you'll thank me thank me later.I watched it in 3D.. Gotta try how 2D is..Awaiting for Avatar 3's release."
"So, is the sequel any good?The film has breathtaking shots and heartbreaking moments. James Cameron expands the world of Pandora like no other franchise. It is by far the best CGI ever.The characters around Jake Sully and Neytiri feel organic and grounded, so you empathize with them at all times.But, the film's biggest weakness is its running time.Where Act 1 felt almost rushed, Act 2 drags a lot. The third act has a good pace, but struggles to reach its big climax.With many characters taking center stage, some characters' character development comes up short. As a result, some of the film's decisions fail to reach me emotionally.The story of the film is similar to the first. Quaritch's return, while plausibly explained, is also a bit lazy. The return of the humans itself is understandable and the conflict between them and the Navi continues to be exciting.The Way of Water is a worthy successor to the first film (which was much too hated anyway).So ... go to the cinema!"
"I would dare say Cameron pulled off another T2; The original is great, but the sequel is leaps and bounds better. The fact that I'm a father and a husband could have me biased, but the showcasing of what family means and what you're willing to do for them is what did it for me. I was definitely not expecting to enjoy this movie as much as I did. And, as expected, the special effects are RIDONKULOUS. If you don't go see it in 3D, you're missing out. My only ""negative"" critique is how the ""villain"" returned. It was kinda ""ehhh, ok, that's fine, I guess"". But other than that, a must see in the cinemas. Especially 3D."
"I watch the Avatar 1, 13 years ago. After that I waited for a sequel hope it will come out soon to theaters. But it almost took half of my life. But it's worth it. I mean in the movie industry there is nothing to give a competition for Avatar series. Music, Visuals, Story is on another level as always. In my opinion I liked the Part 1 mostly to comparing this. But that's no mean this one bad. This is surely better sequel for this movie. Expect the Unexpected right. I wonder how James Cameron able to take out emotion and everything in a movie like this. I so glad to watch Avatar Series in my life. I recommend to everyone who wish to watch this movie in theaters, It is a hell of ride and you can literally live in Pandora when you watching the movie."
"I was a little scared for how this movie would turn out after the incredible first movie. But this one did not disappoint. For the end of the movie I was on my tippy toes the whole time. This movie was so beautiful. It did feel like they just used this movie to introduce the new characters, the characters did not use their whole power wich just shows that they have still a lot to learn and grow that they will show in the next movie. Can't wait for the third movie. It's amazing how they did this movie. I watched it yesterday in 3D. It really made the difference, it really feels like your in the movie."
"I was EXTREMELY skeptical and prepared to dislike this movie EVEN tho I did have fond memories of the original.Well guess what gang? After more than a decade James Cameron proves he's STILL that visionary director that knows how to ENTERTAIN.Yes the simplistic storyline is still there, but his EXECUTION and ability to make you care about the characters.This is the FAMILY FILM of 2022. And after so much WOKE STUPIDITY we finally get to see a HEALTHY and strong father son relationship 💪And notice I haven't EVEN brought up the incredible special effects and visuals... I saw this in IMAX 3d and that's honestly the best way to watch it 🤙🏻"
"Okay i get that people have different opinions and not everyone might enjoy this movie. But for me it was astonishing. Great change of pace from the usual cinema the viewers get. Visual's are amazing and the characters don't have some agenda to shove down our throats. Story might be a little jumbled up but it does not effect the movie in general. Didn't even feel the movie was three and a half hours, time went by so fast and i was left wanting more. Definitely a movie that needs to be watched in cinema to get the best experience possible. So grab your popcorn and your soda and buckle up. Would highly recommend!"
"When i saw the first avatar i was like six year old and a moment i always remember is when in the middle of the sky people attacking and jake was there sleep on the ground. The Movie just cut off in the theater the whole screen just went to black, turns out it was malfunction with the movie projector they were using. They ended up giving us free movie tickets, the movie came back on and i was immediately sucked back into the world of pandora like nothing happened. The Way of the Water Sucked me back into Pandora just like the little kid in that seat in 2009. From the build up to the seeing the movie in IMAX, to finally sitting in my seat i was ready to go back to that seat in 2009 and fall in love with the characters and the world all over again. The Way of the Water feels like a movie that is exactly what it needed to be stunning visuals with a story that is what it needed to be from the beautiful visuals to the simple yet grounded story about family to a more complex story about the ocean and how we need to protect the amazing wonders that come with it. I know that this movie will inspire young filmmakers to strive to build worlds and not be afraid to wait until they feel like it is the right time to make there masterpiece. I just know some kid in there Theater hopefully not with the movie cut off is getting so much inspiration from The Way of the Water. In the end of the day that is all that really matters go see this movie and get inspired in your own ways."
"Compared with other movies released this year in 2022, this movie did a pretty good job of at least being more authentic. The visuals were pretty good, really showing that we are in 2022 and are stepping the game up. The storyline was also amazing. You can see that they put work into it to make the sequel better than the first one. You will enjoy this movie if you watch it with an open mind. This movie will be worth your time and it is going to make you want to live in the avatars world. Avatar is by far one of the best movies in 2022 compared to other movies that run a million-dollar business in the movies industry. You will be mind blown."
"The film is much better than the first one. The effects and CGI have no competition here. The characters are a bit simple, but they are still above average. The story is very absorbing at times and very emotional. Everything works perfectly here, 10/10 for me. I recommend it to all age groups. The film tries to indicate that humanity is a race that should start treating the planet EARTH better. Because otherwise we will soon destroy this planet. James Cameron is one of the best directors of all time and this film only confirms it.Processing-9.9/10
Action-9.5/10
Music-9/10
Story-8.5/10
CGI-10/10
Villain-9/10
Main characters-9/10
Direction-10/10."
"While watching it in the cinema I was blown away by the beauty of the visuals and the exhileration of finally getting to see the sequel. The water looks better than in real life, I'd definitely recommend seeing it in the movie theater. However, three main points left me extremely disappointed:The first movie introduced us to a new world, whose most important aspect was the idea that trees could form a network of roots which would be capable of signal transmission, which provided an actual scientific reason for the planet to essentially think, have agency and provide this communication interface to the Navi. It also made complete sense that it would send all it's animals into the fight for the climax to rid itself from humans. How cool of a concept is that! Out of all the ideas in the world of pandora, this one I really wanted to see explored. Instead, this is completely forgotten about. You are telling me, after at least 15 years, going off of the oldest kids apparent age, the understanding of Ewya of our main characters hasn't progressed whatsoever? Making room for lines to the effect of ""I can feel her, it's so strange"", dropped more or less casually by Grace's daughter.There is no point to Jake's family leaving the forest. It is done in an attempt to protect other Navi, yet has absolutely no effect because their position is rediscovered pretty much immediately and of course fighting breaks out, to the detriment of the navi they are staying with. But now they are in a biome that suits their bodies less and they don't even have the natural protection, described as ""pandoras immune system"", which the forest provides in the form of the animals.Since they don't gain anything from the move and the characters should have strong motivations to stay in the forest, the awful realization the viewer must arrive at is, there is only one reason for them being in the water: James Cameron wanted to make more movies in the ocean, following in the footsteps of his deep sea exploration movies. Showing off the ocean biome is more important to him than exploring the fight against the humans on a grander scale or exploring the relationship between Ewya and the Navi.The first movie has a very clear, red throughline, the stakes are very easy to understand and the hero's journey is quite easy to follow. This movie feels blurry and random in comparison, which is on one hand due to the fact that we don't know the exact scale of the human operation, who is opposing them and what the long-term plan looks like, and on the other hand because the main characters motivation to make such a drastic shift and go to the water people is not properly explained.One can only hope this was just a new setup for the actual interesting plot in the next two installments, but after seeing the disinterest in the concept of the intelligent planet displayed in this movie, I don't have high hopes."
"It would be far too simplistic to say that Avatar: TWoW is the most visually striking movie ever made. This accolade is almost a given considering the length of time James Cameron spent perfecting the technology and techniques needed to bring his vision for the underwater environments of Pandora to life and the amount of money poured into the development of the movie. Instead I will simply say this: This movie makes you sad to leave the cinema. Not in a 'oh what an upsetting movie' way, but in a 'I don't want to leave this world behind' way.The exact same feeling I experienced watching the first Avatar, and the feeling that compelled me to watch that movie eight times in the cinema, has already brought me back to Pandora's oceans three times. And when tickets cost a frankly ridiculous £22.50 these days surely that means something.This is not high concept filmmaking. The script is nothing particularly interesting. The storyline is recycled mostly from Avatar 1 but the setting is changed to the vast oceans that stretch across the planet. We meet new characters who remind us a lot of the old characters; Strong matriarchs, protective fathers, wayward sons. Allow me to make something clear which people may find odd: I do not watch Avatar to be dazzled by a witty script. I don't expect any memorable lines to stay with me. This is a movie that stays with you because you cannot believe your eyes. A movie that effectively replaces the world around you with a living, breathing environment beyond your imagination. This is a VISUAL SPECTACLE, and it is absolutely made for iSense 3D.Avatar is a money-maker because it is shamelessly upfront about what it is. It's a massive, feel-good, tech-driven CGI riot of colour and light and escapism. Overtly at least, this is absolutely the visual pinnacle of cinema. The ocean pulses with life. Every scene is radiant with blue or turquoise or orange glow, shining creatures and flickering embers dance in front of the camera, so close you can truly reach out and feel them. Your eyes struggle to take everything in, especially during the scenes shot at 48fps. Cameron knows exactly when to use these techniques to squeeze every last ounce of awe from his subject material. Long may it continue. I've signed up for the full 5 movie run that's for sure."
"I took the kids to see this and I'm a dad of 3D and the 1st avatar but I figured that as sequels usually go they are not as good as the original. But this movie didn't have a full moment to even rush to the bathroom cause it's 3.5 hours long. The probably 1st 15 min are nonstop craziness and I didn't expect that. So it's visually stunning and I thought the story was great, it reinforced my recollection that James Cameron is still a badass. Don't let anyone fool you. Terminator to avatar both badass go see it in theaters cause you will never get to appreciate the effects the way they are supposed to be experienced,,,,"
"James Cameron has something in him that makes him deliever this type of movie which I believe is once in a life time experience. It's truly a artwork in terms of visual and world building. After 10 years of long production and for future plans the vision is clear and astounding and the 2nd movie builds it up and I am sure short that the Avatar Universe will progress and will conclude with a epic ending but before speculating about future films there are certain things that should be corrected more specifically improved in upcoming films that I found in the part 2 they are
1. The plot should not predictable that leads to less attention towards plot
2. More Hyped moments should be there."
"Avatar The Way of Water is the sequel to one of the films that made film history with its magnificent CGI and spectacular world setting. Avatar The Way of Water does the same but better; it is true that the first Avatar was something revolutionary that had never been seen before (which is precisely why it was such a huge success), but the sequel succeeds in enhancing the world of Pandora even better: by having us discover the seabed and the animal species that live there, we are introduced to a new ""tribe"" and the differences between it and the Na'vi tribe we met in the previous film. The weak point of this film is definitely the plot that for many may be trivial but in any case I consider it better than the previous chapter also thanks to the enrichment of main characters (or at least important characters for the continuation of the story), in this film in fact Sully and Neytiri have children who will also have a more important role than their parents. Avatar The Way of Water can be summarized as a great documentary on the beauties of Pandora enriched by a decent characterization of the characters and with a plot that does not live up to the wonderful world that is told to us in this film.It is recommended to see the film in the cinema on a screen with good quality and preferably in 3D."
"Everything was great it was magical. I'm so glad that it was so fun to see the movie I enjoyed it so much. I hope that there is going to be the 3rd movie. It was such a good experience and a very good time to watch it. Because it is basically like it was before. It was sad, beautiful, magical and i felt like I was there. I gave this rating because I just think it deserves it . The actors did amazing work and they were very talented 👏 it's almost the same story as the first movie but still amazing. It just doesn't feel like I'm watching avatar because the 1st movie came out thirteen years ago but still it was okay."
"First of all watch the film in 3D, the VFX is just breathtaking. The story I thought was pretty good, I don't really know what people are on about when they say it's full of nothing. Sure the middle of the film is a bit empty but that's all, no need to slag the whole movie because of one aspect. The characters were built pretty well and the emotional scenes were good.Overall just watch the movie and form your own opinion. Don't get misjudged by some of the negative reviews. But Jim Cameron is going to need to buff up the main storyline if he wants the next 3 films to impress. But saying that he's already filmed the 3 and started on the 4th so... I hope he has learnt his lesson from the critics about the not so bad story line."
"A visually stunning piece of cinematography! It was a pure delight to watch this and I finished it in one sitting without even realising how the time flew by. The rich flora and fauna of Pandora was truly captivating. Despite the blue faces, the emotions & expressions of the avatars were vivid & clearly understandable, which is further proof of how emotions are the binding force, the common ground among all species.The film reminds me of a beauty fairytale in which the childish elements have been replaced by real-world problems like greed, betrayal, racial differences, death, and war over resources. It depicts human greed, our encroachment over the land of others & how war causes devasting loss to both sides, all while maintaining an aesthetically appealing backdrop. Looking forward to watching the sequel in 3D!I watched the first movie to remind myself of the story line before seeing this one.It was fantastic and the 3d was just mind blowing. I enjoyed it more than the first one.It did have me and my son in tears near the end but it also had some great humour and was very funny.It was nice to see the characters from the first movie and if you haven't seen the first movie then don't worry as you can kind of catch up with it during this one. Watching it in 3D is a must."
"Unfortunately, the movie lakes script and the idea, like they had to do a sequel with nothing in mind. Way different from the first movie as they had to inject a lot of sub stories to justify something.I took the whole family to watch it, kept looking at my watch, and my son was always asking if it will end soon. This is unfortunate.They could have done way better than only trying to prove from minute one that a dumb son can save the day, and family will always protect each other. Insisting on showing that didn't help at all and was too obvious.And oh, spending too much time showing nature and wild life, felt like watching a very long documentary."
"Very good for the movie. In some films, the chances of 2nd film flop are high. But in this case, it has succeeded. But in some cases there were disadvantages. Especially towards the end of the movie, Spider is neglected. I feel like that's an injustice to the scene. At the end of the movie, Spider goes to great lengths to help save Jake and the family, but it's a failing point in the story that Spider isn't tracked down after they escape. In that scenario, Mr. Cameron's neglect of it is a major flaw. And it is a failure of the film that the final battle does not get any help from the headquarters, or at least they are not informed. However, Mr Cameron has created a very successful and excellent film this time. Many thanks to Cameron and the Avatar team. May it be won."
"The goofy dialogue of this movie made me feel extremely uncomfortable.At first I enjoyed the movie because of its beautiful visual scenery. But all of a sudden I hear the word bro and Cuz and I'm disgusted. How does blue alien monkeys from space know earthly slang. Theoretically and hypothetically it is a good movie but, Technically and colonoscopy it's a very unpleasing movie for me in my personal experience and probably is the best movie I've ever seen, I loved it.Of course this is only my personal opinion but, geez louise James Cameron up your game. Hated this movie and hopes James Cameron falls out of a moving car going 200 mph.Thank you."
"The first movie in this franchise was so unique that it was really mind-blowing to watch it. This sequel, though in this too they've broken records in terms of graphics, is not such a great, unique story to watch. The expectations were really very high with the storyline but they ( the creators) just couldn't match up to them.But i think the only downgrade in this film that is weak storyline is because they've tried to continue the story further to make the rest of the sequels and to connect them. Hopefully sequels will have a real good storyline.I'll have to admit this film is by far the best family movie to watch. I think the record breaking box office collection reasons are - Family movie + greatest CG.All that said 8 stars because of great work."
"The visuals were truly breathtaking, the characters were fleshed out amazingly (most of them at least; i will elaborate more on this later), each having fully formed personalities and emotions. The story moves naturally but makes up for drawn out scenes by filling them with beautiful world building and emotionally shocking moments. I usually hate sequels that come out years after the first movie's release but this movie fully succeeded my expectations. My only criticism would be on their use of spider, i would have loved to see him in more scenes with the avatar and then could have been kidnapped later, his kidnapping felt a little early and slightly misplaced. Further on that, they could have leaned in on the avatars biases on humans, then sully and neytiri could have left him behind in a more dramatic way, confirming his theories of never being able to be one of them. This slight change could show a story of his struggle with temptation and secretly wanting validation from his father; this would make his choice to do the right thing in the end much more powerful. But, this did not have a big impact on my opinion of the movie, i came into the theatre expecting a movie that would be hilariously bad but i left full of wonderment and surprise."
"The cgi was so good
And I saw it in 3d so it was SUPER easy to stay interested
Usually I get bored of movies and want them to end but this was good
The cgi is insane.The one part I didn't love was the feral child. It made me mad when the child saved his father and his entire story line was just like what. I also didn't love that they stayed with the water people but it does make sense because of the boy being buried with there ancestors, it was sweet. But everything else was amazing
Also wish they would make it more clear what sort of special power the girl has
I wish they explained it a bit moreSooooo gooood tho."
"The visual effects are amazing. Definitely worth watching. I loved the first part and remember the effect it caused on me, but this one totally met my expectations and even surpassed them.The story is not the moat orrigi al of all, but coming from the story of the first movie, I think this movie is a great sequel and definitely leaves room to grow the story in the future.As for for characters, I feel much more respect for them. Both Jake and Neityri have grown a lot to become great leaders, warriors and heads of the beautiful family.I can't wait to watch it again and pick on more details."
"When you watch Avatar 2009 in 2009 you will have an amazing experience of the 3D scense and effects, but still the story is naive.I feel in 2022 I am watching again Avatar 2009, same effects, same 3D, same everything, and again with a naive story.So, what Avatar 2022 has offered me now? Actually nothing.You will get bored during the first 70-90 minutes.To know what I mean, you just watch (Top gun) 1986, 2022Even If the director announced that it is a series and this chapter is to connect the stories, do I need to wait 13 years to see this part hoping to get a better story on the part 3.If you never watched 3D movie before, yes, you will like the movie, but if you that age like me, you might not feel that excitement."
"I went to the cinema hoping to like this sequel more than the original movie, but not only my hopes were shattered, it was way worse than the first one (imho).Pros:
1) the visuals feel almost more real than our own world. I fell in love with the sea creatures and2) the actors are good, they give their 100% to make it work and you can see genuine effort and passionCons:1) The humans are still stupid, even more than before:
1.1) Why don't they stop using those stupid unprotected exoskeletons?1.2) Why can't they create a toxin that work only on the Navii, since they can create them in labs, drop it on Pandora and then colonise the planet without resistance?1.3) Why don't they put bullet-proof glass on the cockpits of their aircrafts? WW2 planes hat tens of millimiters of it on their cockpits
1.4) Why don't they use flamethrowers instead of guns? The flames make cover less effective, its more of a terror weapon, in the jungle they work better since the range is the same as a gun because of all the trees, on the water it renders the surface a flamy wall making it harder to approach
1.5) the whale's ship could've just blasted sonar at maximum power and the Naviis woldve been taken care of since it can rupture lungs, make water boil and transform your brain into a smoothie kilometers away. (look it up, it's terrifying)2) The dialogue:
2.1) The constant ""bro"" made me want to tear off my ears,
2.2) The Navii-sympathaiser scientist line ""look at their emotion center, proportionally it's bigger than ours"" talking about a being the size of a whale, of course it has a bigger brain if it's 100x bigger than us and can communicate3) The story is the same as before but with space-Maoris instead of space-Natives (still disrespectful since they both get saved by the human/white dude)In conclusion, I do not suggest this movie."
"The plot was very afraid to branch into new territory, and the villain was shallow.Reusing the main antagonist from the first movie wasn't a terrible idea but they didn't make me care for him, and they saved him? The set up 3 movies with one antagonist, which is chronically lazy writing.The visuals were spectacular though, somehow they outdid the spectacles in the first movie by a long shot. The characters were also very solid and interesting which made it easy to stay invested in this movie.Overall Cameron Did Better Than The First Movie But Was Overall Kind Of Lazy With The Plot And Other Aspects Making This Feel Like A Lazy Sequal."
IT WAS AMAZING!!!! I absolutely loved the visual effects and how intense it got definitely would go and see it again The plot was amazing the graphics as well and how emotional powered it was. This is the only time I've ever cried a movie but this was definitely a tear jerker! I recommend it!!!! Be prepared for all the jaw drops!!!!!! Can't wait for the next movie........and the next. Congrats to James Carmen again for another amazing movie!!!!!!! The only problem I had with it was the plot was sorta like the first one. But it was still amazing. Every character and creature had a personality and you get to experience it!!!!
I'll keep it simple. I was bored. At times really bored. This movie had great visuals. I'm sure some scenes will make a great screen saver. The storyline was awful. The twist was uneventful. And it left unanswered questions. At least watch the matinee so you don't feel so bad. Huge letdown from james Cameron. After 14 years I expected boom. Bam. Wow. Oh my. All it got from me was a big inhale and huge exhale of boredom waiting for anything to happen that could make it better. And it was a little woke on top of it. Didn't anyone who made this movie watch it before it was released? One of them could have stepped up and said hey Jimbo. This movie totally lacks that magic you brought in the first one. Not interested in a number 3.
"The rare joy was to watch this movie. After all the marvel latest crap this was a real fresh breath.Didn't expect anything from not-so-much-awaited Avatar sequel but have to say that 3+ hours pasted unnoticed. The plot is simple and easy for understand, but do not feel like something you've watched already. I felt the new and old heroes motivation, liked the new sides of plot as father's/sons problems, maturity, war and loss sadness (me as being Ukrainian felt it very well). The graphic is not simply spectacular (Aquaman feels like cheap China crap in comparison), but make a new benchmark for all blockbusters.10 of 10 absolutely!You have to watch it in theatre for sure."
"I didn't expect the second film to be better. But somehow it was better. I went to see the film at the cinema almost 2 weeks ago, in 3D. I'm still amazed by the visual effects. The most beautiful film I've ever seen and my new favorite. I am going to the cinema this week again, just to see this film. I'm obsessed. The story goes deeper and slower, making you more absorbed in the film. You feel like you are in it yourself, you even want to join in. With each new scene, I was surprised. There are several reviews that say the story is much like the first one, but I don't think so. After 13 years, you had a certain expectation, a battle that would continue. It met my expectation, even more so. The film doesn't have an extreme climax, which I actually like. I'm looking forward to the next one, but I didn't leave the cinema with a desperate feeling of wanting to know how the story continues. This film is a must watch."
"Going into Avatar: The Way of Water, I was keeping my expectations a bit low due to the runtime of this film, but left super surprised. I really loved this film a lot, especially the visuals. I was obviously expecting the visuals to be amazing but not ground breaking, but James Cameron did it again, but better than the first. Some of the stuff in this film I thought it was gonna drag out at sometimes but it didn't for me. This all felt very quick and didn't feel like 3 hours it mainly felt like an hour. The action scenes in this film were better than the first in my opinion because of the underwater sequences and it made them feel more packed with it. The soundtrack is of course amazing and just makes the film amazing. The complaint I have about the film was actually Jake Sully. For no reason Jake was a bit confusing in my opinion because he is a bit of a dick to one of his sons which I kind of get but not really. I get he has a lot of kids now but there wasn't any need for him to act like that. Apart from that I highly recommend this film to anyone and I really enjoyed it. 9/10 for me."
"I didn't think James Cameron could pull off using the same antagonist for both Avatar and Avatar: TWOW but he did. Using Quaritch for both Avatars still felt fresh somehow.Personally, i found this much better than Avatar 1. The story felt less grounded on ""family"" and felt more attached to the pandora as a world. Not saying the first one didn't connect to Pandora, but TWOT pulled it off much better. I also think Kiri is one of the best characters added to this, and using Sigweay for both is a masterclass decision from Cameron.I didn't like the fact that Qualritch was still kwpt alive since now it feels like Avatar 3 might again center around the same characters.Still, I'm excited to watch the next Avatar."
"So many years I have waited and it's was worth it. James Cameron once again made a magnificent movie. Before it started I was ready that the movie will be too long because it's hard to keep the attention during 3h+ but at the end I wa so surprised it was already finish. Because the pictures are so beautiful you stay focus during all the movie very easily, you have too many fish too analyse too many mountains and all the little detailed in the screen keep you alert.For the plot at the start I was a little disappointed because it's not very original but I forget quickly because u get caught with the emotion of the characters.I felt the same Magick when I watched first avatar as a kid."
"I love the visuals. Great nature, great cinematic view in the water. Great and brightly colors. And it's something you have to see at the theater. It was great to see it in 3D. At first I had to adapt to read the subtitles in 3D 😂. It was a shame they did a break in our theater. But the story... 🙄 It's a lot as the last one... finding new Navi's, new animals that are important and humans who want to destroy the planet for their own needs... I really hope that the next episodes will have a better story that will surprise me. But it's nice to see more of Pandora and it's nature and population. Looking forward to see the making off."
"I liked this movie quite a bit; It is proof that James Cameron does know what to say and that he still has relevance in this seventh art. However, apart from its spectacular effects and backgrounds, etc, the script... it's not very good. The approach and development are quite good, but the end is more extended and makes it a bit tedious; I liked it but it doesn't go to the point. It's a problem that this movie has; I enjoyed it, but the 3 hours do feel. It doesn't have too many characters, but some are too meh. The kids are too DUMB. Okay, I get it, they're kids. But they were raised by very strong people; Can't they really obey EVEN ONCE? I liked the part at the end, it's going to develop a lot and I hope they will use it carefully. The children's performances are good. I feel like James Cameron learned to handle his actors a little better. The kids are too DUMB. Okay, I get it, they're kids. But they were raised by very strong people; Can't they obey EVEN ONCE? I liked the part at the end, it's going to develop a lot and I hope they will use it carefully. The children's performances are good. I feel like James Cameron has learned a little more to handle actors from him. But my goodness, what a lousy villain introduction; It's the most stupid, cliché and cheap thing that the screenwriter could come up with. The rest is pretty good, but the introduction of that villain is definitely the worst thing about this movie."
"As we all knew, this was set to be a masterpiece from the get go, being directed by James Cameron. Let me say it definitely did not fail to hold that title. It was magical bringing a family element into it, although I do wish there had been more of a story building up to that family idea.I did enjoy the introduction to the water concept and the water people. It would have been cool do dive a little more in depth with the ways of the water tribe, maybe the history, or even some of the people.I must say i did enjoy the action and explosions in this as well. It was awesome to see, as each part of the screen had something going on. Also I'd like to add that the sound in the theater was phenomenal. The scenes where it was raining, it truly felt like I was there and in the rain myself.Absolutely would recommend this movie to everyone and can't wait for the third!"
"As the title says the visual aspect of the movie is pure flexing what can be done in 2022 .. remarkable, great! Even though the story has that clear line we know from other blockbuster movies, Cameron did a solid, good job at presenting characters, tribes, emotions. You can summarize the plot in a couple sentences, but you can't summarize what details you've seen, what character development you've witnessed and what emotions you felt in those 3 hours bc the whole time you're experiencing something. All in all it's like you know the plot, but you don't know how it's told/presented bc it's way different than anything else you've ever seen!!"
"Oh my gosh. I am so stunned by the CGI/the capture performance. It is honestly one of the best CGI movies I've ever seen through water experience. I love that James Cameron put the element of water into the Sully family. In avatar 2009, we received a film with the OmaTchicaya clan in the forest with Sam Worthington as Jake sully meeting and mating with Zoe Saldana as Neytiri. Their romance in the film was so stunning that in the way of water it enhances even more and is relatable even more with the family dynamic. I truly believe that Jake Sully and Neytiri were meant to be together and practically ""Eywa."" I'm also so fascinated with Sigourney Weaver's reappearance as the avatar and Jake Sully and Neytiri adopted daughter. And the appearance of Ronal as Kate Winslet. Come on, a powerful, independent, stunning, and pregnant woman as an avatar is I think one of the best portrayal of female empowerment. And I ultimately think that that was what James Cameron initially wanted to do, because like he said he probably hadn't seen any female empowerment and this type of character pregnant. It's amazing to see female empowerment in this film with Neytiri, Ronal, and Sigourney Weaver as Kiri. This movie also makes me super emotional too spoiler alert, the death scenes between Jake Sully's oldest son, we obviously didn't get to see much of his character and I think that's what made it super horrendous of a tragedy. I think also the rage that Neytiri has for her family and the ones she's truly loves and goes to great extreme strengths to put upon a death. I think we can all feel Neytiri's emotional rage towards her sons death. I was bursting into tears with that scene and honestly wanted to be Neytiri and get revenge on that s.o.a.b. Stephen Lang's Avatar. Stepping into the action, was so incredible and so kept me on my feet most of it because I am just so worried for Neytiri and Jake's existence because I don't want them to pass because I know in the first film a bunch of characters and a bunch of main characters died, and I'm so anxious for them. I would also like to say, I loved the way James Cameron and Sigourney Weaver's portrayal of Kiri was meant for a woman/female to be independent and nature conservationist in that society. I think the difference between neytiri and kiri is, she will go through great strengths and beliefs and war to fight for the people that she truly loves. And Kiri is that sort of shy, female who wants to be alone with nature and feel the balance of life. She does fight for her family and she truly loves her family but her real main focus I think was to have the nature conservationist. Honestly I would give this movie a 10 out of 10 because I feel with each character and Navi. It can just be so relatable to anyone and I think James Cameron made them feel like in the first film you know we get an introduction of the Sully family and Jake but then as we go to the second movie it kind of brings that protect the family and your love ones trope and I love that because I'm a person who will go through great strengths and beliefs and everything to protect my family. I am so ready and cannot wait for avatar three, I want to see what James Cameron can bring to the table and I've known of his history and filmography. I'm just so excited and cannot wait for it to come out December 20, 2024. It's actually my birthday December 20 so my birthday theme for that year will be avatar theme and I'm gonna get 3D movie maybe a VIP pass I don't know I'm gonna get something that is going to be rememberable for this upcoming excited awaited movie. I love you James Cameron and I hope to see you making more avatar films, which I know you will. Yours truly, Drew."
"Avatar 2 hasn't improved from its prequal.Running away from the trouble to protect the family isn't the right answer. You gotta confront the issue, and the power of family sticking as one to overcome the might obstacle is the key... yeah yeah
I had enough of this kind of lesson from a movie.It serves nothing but a good old cliche for a cheap script writer.Plus, how is it possible to shoot an arrow and pierce a bullet proof window?It makes no sense to witness a helicopter going down by a single arrow.And the kids know too much about the terms Sky People use. I was shocked that the kid knew what an air pocket is."
First of all I would like to say that movie is nice & I watched it within the first week released it. I suggest this as a movie which can be watch with the family and friends all together. I loved the theme of avatar since I watched Avatar first movie. Its simple & in my point when taking it as a content it's 'damages cause by humans to the nature' like vice. So I think it's a nice and great idea which is spreading through this movie in such a time which nature and the animals are harmed. But on the other way I think this movie takes some boring time in middle of the movie like a boring teledrama. Also I think it will be disappointing if avatar 3 comes with usual manner like a tele cast. I hope it will be a explotion in the industry like avatar 1. And I don't think this movie series want to continue because its nice more if it comes to an end. Anyway this movie is really good and kindly remind all of these thoughts not harm to anyone. Thank you 🙏
"13 long years, have I been waiting for the release of this movie. And now, it's finally out.Because of the long waiting time, and all the talent that was engaged in the making of the movie, my expectations were very high. And honestly, at first, I was a little disappointed.The story didn't feel as original and I think the movie score could be made differently to suit the atmosphere the movie creates better.However, after some thought, I must say I am very pleased with how the movie turned out. The acting is exceptional, and the story, though I could imagine it being more complex if the movie were, say, an hour longer. And then there's also the visuals. This movie is a visual masterpiece, with the camera work being done surely by masters in their field.Considering also how difficult filming the movie must have been, the movie we got to see after such long waiting time, the movie is truly a treat worth savouring."
"Very beatiful pitures especially those 3Ds about ocean. So it is worthwhile to watch it in the cinema, purly for the vision.It is more like a fantasy verion of ""Ocean - National Geographic Society ""I cannot believe James Cameron came back with this disappointed movie. But the story is boring and some places are without logic.It seems the whole movie missed its core.There is lack of a specific subject that the director is going to say to the audience. Or the director wants to say too many things but none of them are expressed in depth.Really hope the Avatar 3 will be back with a good story."
"The beginning of the movie is just pure exposition, the plot is sometimes overly simple, many characters lack depth, nothing you haven't heard before. And so what?The movie is spectacular to look at. Watching it in IMAX 3D felt closer to VR than to watching a standard film.One could even argue that a better plot would distract your brain from fully immersing itself in the world that Cameron has created for us. The CGI in Marvel movies looks like a kid's drawing in comparison.If you live close to an IMAX cinema - it's an easy choice. And must be 3D. Otherwise, you have not really seen Avatar 2."
I've read some of the reviews and I disagree. I thought the story was great. The visuals were outstanding. One of the best movies I've seen in a number of years. It made me happy that I was in the theater to see the stunning 3D.From the opening sequence it drags you into the storyline. You get to see Pandora in all its glory. The acting is spot on. There are genuine sequences of emotion and ties to family traditions.Is maybe the first time that I've said this. I would actually go see this in 3D again. It almost feels like you are in Pandora. I took my wife into children. I would not recommend bringing any child that's under the age of eight years old. The violence is a bit much. Much.
"This movie is fantastic. The story is entertaining and kept me on the edge of my seat. My ONLY complaint is that I feel like the visuals weren't as good as the first movie. Many of the scenes almost felt like Video Game cutscenes. Like it looks amazing and super real, but something feels a bit off, and I can't tell what. Other than that, if you enjoyed the first movie, you'll love this one.(u can stop reading the rest I'd just for the required characters)This movie is fantastic.

"Avatar II is a good movie but compared to the 1st , it is bit low in story though higher in effects . The story line is weak as it's main character Jack Selly . The film is also dragged unnecessarily too long at the end . There are multiple times where I think fold should have been wrapped up but it did not . Camera , cinematography are excellent, Avatar spends lot of time on nature which is great about this series . The scene between Jack Sally's boy and the whale were fabulous. The acting was proper from everyone .If you are a big Avatar fan then you can watch once but if you have not seen the 1st one you then you may miss this one ."
"James Cameron does it again. The most visually stunning movie to ever been seen before. It brings heart and a new depth to existing and new characters. The meaning of family is tested and really explored through the relationships seen. Every character is worthy of their own arc, and I hope to see more of the Metkayina Clan in Avatar 3. The beauty of this film is felt on all aspects, in heart, acting, and the setting. This film wows in 3D and 2D. I'm still in awe by the beauty of Pandora. Exploring new areas of this fantastical moon adds a new level to world Cameron has already worked so hard to build. The Way of Water is a worthy successor to the highest grossing film of all time."
"The ""Avatar"" film series, directed by James Cameron, is known for its groundbreaking use of technology and special effects. The first film in the series, ""Avatar,"" was released in 2009 and made use of innovative techniques such as performance capture and 3D technology to bring the film's fictional world and characters to life. The sequels to ""Avatar,"" only being ""Avatar: The Way of Water,"" as of now, continue to push the boundaries of visual effects and immersive storytelling.In terms of the enjoyment of the film, this is a subjective experience that can vary from person to person. Some viewers may find the ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" to be visually stunning and engaging, while others may find the change from 48 fps scenes to 24 jarring and out of place. I would have much preferred the entire movie to have been shot in 48 fps as I genuinely enjoyed the 48 fps scenes shot when I viewed the movie in my local Cinemark XD 3D theater. The 3D was stunning and by far the best use of it since my viewing of the original ""Avatar"" in 2009. The story was great at including as many of the main characters as they could, I just wish some more screen time was given to Jake, Neyteri, and their oldest son, Neteyam. Personally I felt like Jake had some character decisions that did not represent who he became at the end of the original film, which could have been better explained."
"Visually stunning- but the story had no substance.A shallow plot interwoven with beautiful and thought-provoking moments scattered throughout. Ultimately these moments have no meaningful impact on the story.Dialogues felt unnatural. ""Are we there yet?"" and the excessive usage of the word ""Bro"" stuck out to me. And Jake calling Kiri ""Babygirl"" hahahaha. So many more examples of awkward dialogues. Don't get me wrong here, I get why they had the Navi speak English, but it still felt strange.The first movie explored the complex nature of the relationship between the Navi and humans. It was about desperate attempts at diplomacy gone south, and the clashing of cultures far detached. It had complex character development, entire inversions of characters interests and motives. It posed many questions and ethical dilemmas.The Way of Water posed no questions, it felt like a trimmed down version of the same story. The new setting had no meaningful impact on the story besides serving as a pretty backdrop.I'm happy I saw this movie because I enjoyed the spectacle of it. But objectively it's a massive letdown. I give it 5/10 in general.Almost 10/10 on visuals if not for the awkward HFR moments."
"I cannot say it is a bad movie. It is a good movie. There are points where the script is unconnected. The action part of the film, after a point, feels like it is there to fulfil a purpose, which does not make the scenario genuine. Also, The son cannot be so disobedient!!! The action lasts too long. The first movie was very good. As a result the standard was too high. The work of 14 years can be seen in the movie from the special effects side. Scriptwise, there are weaknesses . I would be unfair for such an effort to put a 7, but it would be too high to put a 9. In my eyes a 7.7 would be the fairest choice. It is a movie I would watch again, but not in the near future."
"In an age where sequels only loosely and haphazardly connect to their groundbreaking predecessors in order to make major returns for the studios, it's refreshing to see that Avatar: The Way of the Water truly does live up to the high standards of the original and doesn't fall victim to the all-so-tempting cash grab route of resting on laurels; a strategy that permeates the high budget CG action genre of today.As a big (and only recent) fan of the first, I was looking forward, with cautious optimism, to what James Cameron had left to tell us about the land of Pandora and it's inhabitants. I'm happy to say that the story, and characters featured, are a faithful and worthy extension of the world already created. With a few pacing issues, and a runtime that would make even a diehard kojima fan's head spin, there few things that I take issue with in this film.What truly set the original Avatar a head and shoulders above othst films of the time we're the visuals. I still remember seeing the home of the Na'vi for the first time and being in blissful awe of how far computer graphics have come. It's something truly special to be able experience the same leap in CG again. Even the less action scenes were still a feast for the eyes. It is all the wonderful sights that you would expect and more for a film bearing this name.Though I believe no film is truly perfect, I think that a 10/10 film is one that exceeds the value of the movie ticket. And that is, in my opinion, what Avatar: The Way of the Water does.In any case, this is a must see film."
"So firstly, thanks to James Cameron for this film! My expectations were a bit lower,I thought it probably wouldn't be as good as the first one, but it was even better, more complex, more shocking, much more comparable with our Earth, and with our way to destroy everything!Even if you think the movie starts a bit slow, wait a bit, the best is yet to come!Amazing story, based on our way of treating the Earth and even other planets, always superior, like the sky people in the movie;
Unique visuals and a unique world: if the jungle world was speechless, this is even more, the extraordinary world of water, where animals are part of the family, inner animals, or friends. Too much to say about this, I cried, not once but more than 5 times...a story with 0 sex, 0 porn, and 0 superficial things, like most movies! Go and see for yourself! 10/10."
"This is a film where my jaw was dropped by the level immersion and realism with also jaw dropping and heart palpitating action. The 3rd Act in this film is like nothing I have ever seen in cinema. Best 3D ever put on screen as well. You care about the characters and by the end of the film you want to see them succeed. There are moments where if you don't shed a tear, your one of the most jaded pricks ever. James Cameron doesn't try and tell you directly that hurting the environment is bad, he just shows you acts in the film that directly result in it. This is a must see event for everyone to witness. James Cameron is on a whole different level in the world of directors. This was definitely worth the 13 year wait, but the most exciting thing is that we only have to wait 2 more years for the 3rd film to arrive. Great things to come from this special director. Thanks Jim."
"Watch it!Recent years have for, whatever reason, made the Avatar franchise a more polarized topic than it ever deserved to be. What we really have here is an incredibly talented man devoted to making this series his life-long accomplishment.The reality of what I saw was a packed theater giving a round of applause at the end, a young woman crying emotional from the movie, and myself and my girlfriend nodding in agreement with people talking about how amazing they thought the movie was.I have the utmost faith in the story being built over the upcoming movies, and I think that the building blocks that they added in this movie were superb and executed well and I look forward to seeing their development.For me, it is easy to call it the best sequel I have ever seen. It is captivating, beautiful, and would be a shame not to experience at least once.I also believe it is worth everyone watching and making their own opinion! I made this account and wrote my first ever review solely to combat some of these more ridiculous reviews that gloss over elements of the movie that weren't just good, but GREAT and hit hard on parts of the experience that weren't bad but just good. These more ""salty"" reviews compelled me to write this more than anything, as this movie and series (in my opinion) really deserves better than that.At the end of the day, I enjoyed it more than most any movie I have seen in recent history, and I sincerely hope that many more people watch it and enjoy it as much if not more!10/10 Would and will most definitely watch again."
"You've done it again.You're doubtlessly one of the most talented film makers of our century. Thank you for making feel such and unforgettable experience; AGAIN.One of the most astonishing CGIs ever seen in theatres, a unique and immersive universe filled with magic and iconic characters.Can't wait for the rest of the saga to begin, this is just the beginning, you're overachieving any expectations and leading the way of storytelling and entertaining.You've created your own style, dimension and type of film that many others will try to replicate but will never do.GOAT of the industry!!"
"I liked Nature. And in This film nature , water , forest, animal are so beautiful and dangerous. There is no pollution, no cell phone, and no more population.Some people are destroyed this place for leaving, why they are increasing their population. What should be required to leave , only house , eat, cloths.Why we generates problems and then we are weeping.I want to leave in a forest. Because there is no pollution, no cell phone, no vehicle, only nature.Thanks to all avatar movie actor and actress and all team , director.That is my favourite movie. I liked avatar 1 comparison to 2nd part.So
#saved the nature."
It was amazing to come back to pandora and not just to witness what we already have but explore a whole new world ! He did it beautifully and at the perfect pace to make this long movie feel like it just flowed from start to finish ! Thinking there was not much more pandora could offer was a complete misunderstanding. Exploring the water and what it had to offer just reignited the feelings I had when I watched the first avatar. I am so excited to see what else James Cameron can do with the rest of the instalments and I Will be going back to the theatres to see this again that's for sure !! Thank you James Cameron!!
"The narrative is extremely bland and primitive.Without spoiling anything the concept of the movie is a bunch of human clones who are now Avatars seek out Jake Sully and the gang to take revenge for being killed or exiled from Pandora in the first movie.That's basically it. The remaining three hours of the movie go on to show Jake's struggle to keep his people safe with the impending humans coming back to take their revenge. We get introduced to a new setting and extremely forgettable characters. Matter of fact there is basically no human actors in this movie, it's mostly all Avatars which doesn't work in the films favour. Partly what makes sequels successful is that people want to see their old favourite characters in action or the introduction of memorable new ones we grow to care about and want to see a potential third movie. This film gives us a ton of absolutely forgettable characters and doesn't give us any reasons to care about them for a third instalment.The visuals are the only reason I give it a 5. If they were hypothetically done poorly I'd actually give this film a 3/10 maybe even a 2. There is no way I would have sat through and watched this empty plot at home on the TV for 3.5 hours and only reason I didn't walk out was because my partner fell asleep who loved the first one so much she saw it 3x in the cinemas but couldn't keep her eyes open for the last 90 minutes.I looked around the cinema and managed to spot one other person dead asleep and if they were to ask me what they missed it could be summarised quite thoroughly in 2 minutes.I think this movie came 8 years too late and it's become completely irrelavent. The people who saw this movie as teens or young adults 13 years later should definitely have out grown it's thrill. I still would have an easier time summarising what made the first film more memorable having last seen it about a decade ago than telling you what I liked about this film having just walked out of the theater.Good luck making 2 billion on this movie!"
"After years upon years of standard CGI quality and superhero films, I was beginning to question if we'd ever receive blockbuster experiences like Avatar ever again. Top Gun Maverick gave me hope, and Avatar the Way of Water sealed the deal. It's a lengthy movie but for those who've missed the days of yore such as the LOTR trilogy, then 3 hours is nothing. From start to finish Avatar is a visual masterpiece, leaving me wondering what was real and what wasn't. I also must say I'm incredibly impressed with James Cameron managing to stick a whale in a green screen suit! Jokes aside, that's how visually epic this movie is, and it'll blow your mind just like the first one did if you saw it in theaters with the 3D glasses. The story is crafted delicately, allowing you time to be introduced to Pandora once again, the world, its culture, familiar characters, and completely new ones as well. It's a slow build, but well worth it, and once you get to the actual water you're just left glued to your seat. It was a breathtaking breakthrough of cinema once again. I praise James Cameron for being able to deliver again a masterpiece in cinema. Go see this movie! It's utterly incredible."
"##spoilers##The visuals and the world are again amazing. However... the story is far from disappointing. It is pretty much the same story all over again. Changing the message of ""love"" to ""family"". Zoe's character is completely misused (she pretty much just screams angrily, sadly or ""lalalalalaiii"" in the whole move). Using the same enemy all over again as this unkillable ""final boss"" is bearing becoming a meme. On top of that, guess what? He will probably be back as the final boss on the 3rd movie.When I was watching I was hoping for some unexpected plot twists involving the colonel and Spider. Something on the lines of the colonel quickly being captured or becoming an ally. But nope... he once again played the same role on a hunt that makes absolutely no sense. Why would the explorers invest so much to hunt someone that was even running away. Left the movie quite disappointed 😕"
"Watch it in IMAX 3D for the best experience. It was such an incredible and moving movie. The animation was just draw dropping, it was as if it was real. I have no clue how James Cameron and the whole Avatar team did it, but it was absolutely amazing. When the movie was over I was truly speechless. I cannot wait for the new Avatar films to come out in the coming years, because if it's half as good as this one it is going to be spectacular. It was an incredibly immersive experience. Everything was thought through and executed so seamlessly. It is definitely worth your time to go see this movie. Ending the year on a great note!"
"I have always loved the first movies world building and main characters, so I had very high expectations. And this movie met them at every point which is why I give it a 10/10, I thought about giving it a 9/10 to not seem too generous, but this is how I truly felt once leaving the cinema.I saw the Movie in Imax 3D which took a minute to get used to, especially because I had to wear another pair of glasses underneath to see properly, but I soon became engulf into the beautiful water scenery and pandora world. I loved the bioluminescence of the first Avatar movie so I am glad to see it return. The animals of the oceans were stunning and I appreciated the intelligence and connection they had with the Metkayina clan. The 3 hours 20 min runtime didnt feel that long at all which was surprising and I managed to sit through without a toilet break.As for the storyline, the movie was all about family and doing whatever you can to protect it. The kids having to leave home and learn a whole new lifestyle parallels Jake Sullys journey to learn the way of the Omaticaya na'vi in the first movie. This was heartwarming, yet also filled with frustration as the kids often found themselves in trouble which I think a lot of people can relate to.A familiar villain returns with humans and now they planning to terraform pandora for human living as the earth is a dying planet. The amount of destruction and disregard for nature and wildlife displayed allows you to see they are doing the same thing to pandora. It made me reflect on how we as a whole treat our earth and wildlife.The action was incredibly executed and there were even a few jumpscares. I enjoyed the Pandoran sea animals joining in for a bit of action too. The ending moved me to tears which was slightly surprising because I never felt that emotional since the first movie.Personally, Avatar way of water is my favorite movie of this year, and I look forward to the next installment of the Avatar series."
"Usually in a trilogy you have high expectations that the movie will be a total flop. Well, I was highly impressed by this movie that talks so much about life and death. The central theme captures human life very very easily in simple words, they are repeated throughout the movie and it's the eternal truth. Our bodies are made of water, we are formed from water and develop in our mothers wombs from water, not technically but you get the point. The focus on this movie is based around central themes of family and how water is an important part of our life. This movie will signify that tenfold. Hats off to James Cameron for providing us yet another classic. This is equally good as the original Avatar, 13 years later."
"It's so rare when a sequel is better than the original. This was a perfect story. They have the right balance between happiness and sadness with the right amount of villains and heroes.You'll understand why this was called the way of the water."" The movie introduces some amazing sea creatures, and a bond between them and the avatars that is second to none.We watch this in a small theater in Maui so if you have an IMAX available, I highly recommend you watch it there. The CGI surpassed the first movie. So realistic. Makes me want to be an avatar for a while.Again, James Cameron doesn't disappoint. So much happens I'll definitely be watching Avatar a second or third time."
"I made an IMDB account just for this review.. I just saw the movie last weekend in cinema and after 13 years of waiting I can say that it reached my expectations.. now I cannot wait for the third one!!!! Movies like this make make me want to become an actor to play in grest movies like this haha.The change of scenery really fit very well, it was a good change because I really tought that all the action will happen again in the forest area.There are a few questions that are left unaswered but I guess that we will find them in the third movie, I just hope it will not be delayed so much like the second one.All in all, a must watch, even better than the first one."
"Movie shows what US military have done to Native Americans and still doing to weaker countries now.Painful to watch in some scenes, how happily living people are simply crushed and burned by technological and military advantage.By people who came to their land just to steal resources. Was expecting more from 3D point of view as well. The plot also turned out to be weaker than the first Avatar. Well, except for the message, how humanity kills everything around, and first of all, its own brothers from other parts of the world.I would say the movie can be seen not in 3D format and this is shame for such a movie as Avatar."
"The plot might be a bit thin, typical family drama, but oh my god were the visuals good.I watched it in theater with 3D and HighFrameRate and this was the first movie with 60fps for me and it simply was mind blowing on how much better everything looked.But the best part of this movie were the scenes which introduced the new underwater world. Compared to many other movies this one actually had a lot of time for simply showing off how beautiful everything looks and what magic stuff exists. The plot isn't really something important in this movie, don't go to the cinema just for the story, go there to experience a new world, like a small documentation. Simply awesome."
"The movie plays out like this:
30 minutes of random cluttered scenes that lacked a clear direction.90 minutes of beautiful CGI and VFX (and credit where credit is due, I saw it in 3D and it was beautiful to look at.)Then about 60 minutes of a final fight scene.And so much talk about family I'm convinced they could've subbed out Jake Sully for Vin Diesel and it would've worked just as well.Overall there isn't enough substance to make me connect with any of the characters, except for 1 boys friendship with a fish.I've seen the first Avatar countless times over the years. I don't know if I'll watch this one again."
"Loved it. The movie was amazing and the movie was so beautiful the story could have done a better but overall the story was mid.I loved some of the characters but some characters needed more screen time and story to develop their character.The story was emotionally bound to me and I felt every emotion, the acting was amazing but some of the dialogue felt off for some character's but not to bad to the point where you could just leave the movie. The visuals were outstanding the best I have ever seen and the action was glorious. Although some of the scenes looked jittery almost idk if it was just my movie theater but overall this movie makes the first one feel boring so a win is a win."
"All in all, I really liked Avatar 2 for the most part. It still presents this huge message and isn't afraid to get dirty. Hell, it killed off one of its main cast, something movies these days don't really want to do.From here on out, I'll be talking about the plot. You have been warned.At first, it's very predictable, with Jake finally having a family and the big baddie (the old dude from the first movie) getting his plot armor out yet again. I won't spoil the surprise there. And yes, he's still alive by the end of this movie. But things take a drastic turn. Jake decides to ditch his people even though they're in the middle of a crisis. What happened to standing your ground and protecting your people? Sure, he left a great leader in his place, but they're going to probably get completely destroyed.So anyways we shift over to these islands that contain a different subspecies of the Na'vi, which is quite interesting but glanced over because it's not important to the plot. His entire family learns their ways, whatever, we've seen this before. But this is where it gets interesting and also quite tragic.Kiri, who happened to be the daughter of Grace, and Jake's adopted one, decides to link with their spirit tree that's underwater.Before I carry on I would like to comment on what they did to the spirit tree. Previously, not much was done with it. Spirit trees just allowed the na'vi to communicate with their deity. Now, it allows them to look back on the memories of their deceased love ones, and even communicate with them, which is a really nice touch.She obviously meets Grace, but only shares a few words with her until their connection was suddenly cut off. This can only mean one thing: Something really bad has happened with Jake's people back home. Yet, this is not hinted at any further. They figure out she has epilepsy, and that's suddenly a wrap to that subplot. She doesn't talk about that crazy thing that just happened, not even to her own father, mother, or her brothers. And shouldn't the ""sky people"" constantly be hunting Jake down? It took months for them to find him even though he didn't go far.And yes, half of this movie is about a whale. It doesn't surround Jake or Neytiri, they're just supporting characters now. Instead it focuses around their youngest son and that stupid whale.Again, I think they absolutely nailed the theme and message, but even my patience ran dry when they were constantly focusing on just one character and him screwing everything up. What's worse is that some of the locals even try to kill him and don't even get a slap on the wrist.And apparently when the big fight comes, Jake wins, obviously, and not by much, but he can't hold his breath for that long underwater? For 30 minutes we got a montage of his kids learning how to do it. What, did he just learn to ride a fish? From months worth of work? Because it sure seems like it. And then when the colonel has been suffocated by Jake, he clearly has nothing left, and he still gets saved by Spider? He lasted twice as long as Jake with no breath to spare. He hadn't even learned how to hold his breath either. By the end it's hinted that he'll get some kind of redemption arc, but seriously? He should have died there, and he's the villain no less, the good guys got the short end of the stick and heavy losses.All gripes aside, if you want a movie that's one of the most visually stunning of the century, go ahead. It's a visual masterpiece and should be enjoyed for what it is.It's a great movie, probably the best one in years, I'll give it that, but the inconsistencies somewhat ruin it for me. Have a merry Christmas."
"Performances :
James Cameron is known for getting the optimum out of his cast and crew. All the actors came up with brilliant performances. Jakes Sully standout by showing variations in expressions and emotions. He maintained the same intensity to make an impact. Zoe Saldana, Clif Curtiss, and Kate Winslet blended with him to elevate the scenes with their performances. The actors who played the roles of their children brought in good emotions to complete the story.Technical values :
Technically, Avatar-The Way of Water is outstanding. Right from VFX to graphics work everything looks captivating. The 3D effects are stunning and they are not just for the sack of publicity. Each 3D shot has proper research and reason.The Pandora world created is just amazing and is presented superbly deep underwater. Technical brilliance is visible in each and every shot throughout the film.The background score composed by Simon Franglen is arresting and elevates the mood of the film nicely. The photography work by Russell Carpenter is nice. His work registers despite the film having more graphics.The collective editing work done by Stephen E. Rivkin, David Brenner, John Refoua and James Cameron is effective. The production design is stunning and so is the case with the production values Lightstorm Entertainment and TSG Entertainment. For the audience who are watching the Telugu version, the Telugu dialogues written by Srinivas Avasarala elevate the emotional depth of the film decently.The second installment from the creative genius James Cameron's cinematic universe, Avatar has high making standards. Alongside the magical setup and fictional premise created, Avatar-The Way of Water addresses elements like social equality, civilization and takes a strong anti-military stand.The underlying theme of the film that showcases parents protecting their children and vice versa is conveyed beautifully during the ending portions. On the flip side, the main drawbacks of the film are the thin storyline and lengthy runtime. To summarize, Avatar 2 is a greater cinematic experience that deserves to be watched on Imax 3D screen to witness the grandeur."
"The run time is starting to kill these movies. It would get a 10 from me with better plot/time management. I was joking they ""were gunna need a montaaaaaage""(South Park, IYKYK).The film has a tendency to drag in the middle, it's visually stunning during this time, but the story itself started to feel insignificant. I'm all for character development but it wasn't really even quite that, it was like a cheap version.I will say, I felt the final act completely made up for the long run time, it was just a shame it had to. The action had me on the edge of my seat and flinching. And so many of those moments carried emotional weight as well. During high speed movement, and those trademark Avatar stunts, I was a bit shocked by just how realistic everything looked.Overall I would encourage people to see Avatar 2 in theaters, and I almost always wait to be able to watch via streaming or renting. If it wasn't 3.5 hrs I'd be seriously considering going again to watch in 3D."
"Then in 2009...Shocked not only with technology, but with everything else, with heart, passion, butal music, story, characters, villain, brutal planned action. I watched AVATAR more than 10 times in the cinema, the first time right after the end of a movie I bought a ticket for the next week, then the next, then the next, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, and that movie became my favorite until I watched Interstellar too. The music from the movie and every scene has been running through my head for the past 13 years. I've been patiently waiting for Mr. Cameron to step this movie up a notch and show why it's the best...and why AVATAR is a visual technical masterpiece!! ! And then, so happy, I go with my father to Avatar: The Way of Water iMax 3D !!!...A couple of times during the movie I turn my head to the side, I look at my father, he at me, several times during 3 hours and 12 minutes.at the end of the movie, we stood up, kept quiet, quietly and casually left the shopping center as if nothing important had happened... I was disappointed in many ways... A LOT..that disappointment will remain in the head .. Mr. Cameron, dear Sam, Zoe, Stephen....you just lost two of your biggest fans, 13 YEARS I CARED ABOUT AVATAR, I'M NOT ANYMORE."
"Avatar 2 the way of the water was way too predictable, not only in the way that it mirrors the same plot points from the first movie but also recycles exact dialogue verbatim.If you just want to experience more of Pandora and get lost in the beautiful eye candy of this lush world, then Cameron delivers a buffet table! If you were hoping to engage in a well written story, clever dialogue, and character development, then it falls flat. There are no twists, turns, or high risk situations that will have you on the edge of your seat.The new worlds are amazing to experience as well as the new creatures, especially the whale like creatures ""Tulkuns"" and they're unexpected communication abilities.But Way of the water does not have the same magic as avatar one. That feeling you got when Jake was discovering the world is not the same. The big impending doom and sorrow when watching home tree burn and all the people screaming, tries to be replicated with the Tulkuns but doesn't hit the same. When Jake rallies all the tribes together and the Animals all coming storming out the the forest to fight, the second lacks severely. In fact nobody does anything super big or heroic, the final fight scenes are mainly focused on the Sully Family vs the big baddy. Nothing as big and grand as the first.The opening interactions between characters is cheesy and tries to spoon feed the audience information instead of letting us figure things out. Learning how the Colonel is back to life is quickly explained through some fast dialogue explainers. Two especially cringe worthy opening scenes, is when Kiri falls asleep in the meadow and is awoken by spider "" I was doing that thing again wasn't I?"" a very forced way to make the audience to go ""oh what was she doing?"" .... only to never have her fall asleep like that again, nor have any other characters even encounter her on these ""vision"" moments. Another forced scene is when Spider says ""Sometimes its better to not know who your father is"". The moments again felt so forced and cringy. Instead of showing us how a character feels it is more often just said through dialogue. I would have rather seen spider have personal moments of reflection, even sneaking away to the forest to visit the ruins of his dead father alone, where we see his face have confusion, sorrow, and then anger at who that man was. But no, we need to use that screen time to show off pandora in national geographic type cut scenes.The motivation of many of the characters falls flat, I can't say I sympathized with why they choose their actions. Spider is another great example, he does such a quick flip to helping the Clonal learn the Navi and Pandora ways, almost no internal struggle or gradual warming up to the idea of helping him.The film has some exact sequences that are a copy of the first. The chiefs daughter will teach the forest Navi the ways of the water, they have to learn to bond with new water creatures which is a challenge at first. Chiefs daughter falls in love with the new outsider. Just as Avatar one had Jake alone in a hostile wilderness and is saved by a Navi local, Jakes son has a verbatim experience beyond the reef, exploring a new hostel world he is unfamiliar with, almost gets killed by beast but is then saved by a local. Just as the military did a big attack on Home Tree in Avatar one that finally stirred up the Navi to fight.... The Military launches a big attack on sacred pandora big creatures which also inspires the Navi to fight.73 year old Sigornay weaver was just not cutting it for me as a 14 year old teenager. Her voice did not sound young, and mannerisms felt forced like trying to portray a teenager instead of being one.Overall the movie visually is stunning, and worth a watch in the theater. But I am not eager for a second viewing anytime soon."
"I left the IMAX cinema speachless, trying to digest what I just had experienced. It's a must to watch it on the best quality available wherever you live. This film has the most impressive, beautiful, delightful and pleasant visuals you will ever see on a screen.The 12 year wait was worth it, Avatar: The Way of Water needed to be produced with the best filming and editing technologies to date in order to deliver one of the best cinema experiences ever. If you are a nature and wildlife enthusiast, you will absolutely love to see Pandora's sceneries, wildlife and ecosystems like never before; and to appreciate the parallels between the living world of Pandora and planet Earth. Just speachless."
"This movie keeps reminding me of American terrorism and colonialism around the world from the past, present, and future. People watch this movie and want to see cool stuff, but like every Hollywood movie this one has a message for the people too, but unfortunately the sheeple are too deep in sleep to get the messages hidden in the movies that come out these days. The terrorists in the movie are depicted as the American army who go into countries and destroy civilians and civilian structures and then when they come back home they get called heroes and patriots. Movies like this come out to teach a thing or two but the population has really dumbed down and don't care about messages a movie might hold."
"I haven't felt asleep in cinema since the ""Lord of the rings"". Not that LOTR was so bad, but it was too long.While this movie has spectacular visual effects, well, that's all it has. Incredibly weak story, and incredibly long scenes that tell nothing. At least nothing new.I can understand the echological message Cameroon wants to transmit, but there are lots of masterpice doccumentaries by David Attenborough which are doing a far better job, and at least they are about real species which are dissapearing. I liked the first one, and, as in many other cases, it should have better been the only...My 15 years old kid, after reading some reviews, warned me: ""I don't want to see it, and you better skip it either""...But, after all, if one does not have anything else to spend 3 hours on, and prefers to dream with open or closed eyes instead, this is a good opportunity."
"It's a very good movie
Nice direction
Nice vfx I mean extremely awesome
It's a awesome theater experience
I watched 2 times in theater
I want to watch it again
Just awesome
48fps is just next level movie was like smooth like butter
And his daughter
I love her daughter very much she's my favorite character in this movie
And visual design is killing
And it's trying to tell a fact
How humans changed earth and
How they killed ocen and under water animals
For they're personal use
This movie is just very awesome please go and watch in theater ones in a life time experience so must watch.I love it really."
"James Cameron has out done himself with this masterpiece. I was a little hesitant about sitting thru a 3:20 Avatar after the just ok first one. It was predictable and cliche but this is so far superior to the original that it almost makes the original unnecessary. Mind blowing yet BEAUTIFUL landscapes, cinematography and creatures compliment the story unlike anything I've ever seen. The emotional connection you feel with Jake and his family is like that of my own. You care deeply about their fate and the outcome. The action sequences were bold and magnificently choreographed, yet you never un up with ""battle fatigue"" like in so many other movies. If 'The way of water' doesn't take home best picture, it'll be a travesty. Simply awe inspiring."
"Few movies with expectations as high as #Avatar2. For my humble concept, he more than fulfilled them. The level of realism in animation that #JamesCameron reaches in this new installment is almost disturbing. Looks like we're watching a #NatGeo docuseries. On a technical level, I have no doubt that she will win all the #Oscars where she is nominated. In the part that has to do with history there is nothing different. For some that is the mole. The story is light, critics say. Well, I don't know, maybe. But perhaps Cameron thinks that there is no need to complicate and give more depth and too many twists to the central message, which has been present since the saga shocked the world 13 years ago. The main predator of our planet is us, the human race, and it does not seem that this is going to change with the technological advance; quite the opposite. The path we are following will lead us to what, the day we have sufficient technological capacity to reach other planets, we will do it with violence. But it always have been like that. The story in terms of narrative is weak, it is not at the level of the cinematic experience, but the latter makes the former completely forget, so much so that its 3 hours 15 mins are not felt. It's certainly worth watching, and if it's in 3D, it'll add an added twist to the experience."
"Best Movie This Year!!Love how they showed the family bond and rolls. The older brother's heavy responsibility to the middle child rebellious behaviors, to the the youngest innocence and a sister thats adopted but yet made the family whole!!I liked how it answered things and left some unanswered so we have somethings to look forward to. This is a great build up for what is to come in the upcoming movies parts !!I think James Cameron is genius as far as waiting out for a great franchise to die so he can build upon this franchise! Great timing , great movie, excellent details in a good story 👌"
"Avatar 2 The Way of Water is a pleasure for the eyes just like the first movie that I have watched countless times and LOVE. But somehow after 13 years and that is the only thing that equals the first movie. The returning charachters, music and visuals are great, but the story feels too lazy, similar and you know what is going to happen before it does. I feel like it is a mixture between the first movie, the documentary ""Our Planet"" and the movie ""Free Willy"".After 13 years and a HUGE budget I hoped for better and I do hope that this was a build up for the upcoming avatar movies.Rating 6.5."
"A film, in general, is not only reduced to special effects but also to the human transmission of the actors! Here we only had Navi (at one point they were all the same) ...a poorly breathed script ...embarrassing to revive Colonel Quaritch it is clear that James Cameron had no ideas at all! In the end, he left the villain in life just to have a continuity with Avatar 3!?! How embarrassing!! Anyway, the first Avatar had fantasy...imagination...story and a kind of uniqueness combined with a dose of realism...but this was beyond any criticism! Forced scenario, nothing original. Too many clichés and everything predictable. At the part with the sinking ship, it looked like a Titanic remake, but set on Pandora. And the soundtrack didn't come with anything new either, being taken from the first Avatar. But from the point of view of highlighting the fantasy universe, yes, the images and effects are very successful. Although I consider it a new nail in the coffin of Hollywood's originality, I did not regret spending three hours on Pandora.But I wouldn't watch it all over again!Grade 7/10."
The action was pretty good.. masterpiece vfx. The End scene was too good. I loved it.excited to see the next part what a great movie. I hope the next part is good as this one. The cast was good to. They all did pretty good there was a little bit of comedy in the movie that I loved. My favorite avatar character was Jake. His dangerous look and his acting was just wow. At the end of movie one of the actor die that was pretty emotional. Every scene I watched I had goosebumps. The water scenes and the animals. Overall the movie is just masterpiece. Heads off to the Director of the movie. I want All of you to watch the movie. And enjoy it.
"Avatar: The Way of Water is a 2022 American epic science fiction film directed and produced by James Cameron, who co-edited the film and co-wrote the screenplay with Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver from a story the trio wrote with Josh Friedman and Shane Salerno. Distributed by 20th Century Studios, it is the sequel to Avatar (2009) and the second installment in the Avatar film series. Cast members Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldaña, Stephen Lang, Joel David Moore, CCH Pounder, Giovanni Ribisi, Dileep Rao, and Matt Gerald reprise their roles from the original film, with Sigourney Weaver returning in an additional role. New cast members include Kate Winslet, Cliff Curtis, Edie Falco, and Jemaine Clement. In the film, Na'vi Jake Sully (Worthington) and his family, under renewed human threat, seek refuge with the Metkayina clan of Pandora. Jake Sully and Ney'tiri have formed a family and are doing everything to stay together. However, they must leave their home and explore the regions of Pandora. When an ancient threat resurfaces, Jake must fight a difficult war against the humans. Avatar 1 is the biggest collection movie in global. James Cameron is best director. We know that he makes the world's best films. Movie feels new world. Pandora is new world. Avatar is looking a real alien . This film makes new records in world. I will giving 8.9 rating for James Cameron story. I think this series will continue. Thanks for reading my review."
"Amazing cgi and depiction of the beautiful world of Pandora, of course I saw it in 3D, but the script was not worth the expectations. A lot of new characters that we learned almost nothing about while they had great potential for the story. We could have learned a lot more about the village and the water tribe in general instead of other scenes that were not so useful to the script and the story could be more comprehensive something the film could have done with the three hours it was given. The film also left many questions. Here I must say that for me personally the most important thing in a movie is the script, something that was very superficial and not properly worked as it should have been in this movie. Still it wasn't a bad movie, not even average, above all kudos to the people who worked on it and I would definitely watch it again."
"Experiencing Eywa move around me with my 3D glasses on , and feeling connected with the great mother nature of pandora and Na'vi species is like living in a dream so real. I can't imagine how on earth James has been able to pull this incredible saga of the Avatars. Na'vi people are inspiring, living in an amazing life, full of content and respect for the nature surrounding them be it the forest ones or sea ones. A quite clear and meaningful message this story gives us, as a mankind, to love nature, family and then self. Here the usual villain (sky people) representing humans have been ridiculed again (continued from part 1) for their ignorance towards love of nature and their brainless conquest for Amrita ( this is truly inspired from the Hindu mythology Amrita is the nectar for Hindu gods to remain ageless).There are few parts definitely like the underwater playful scenes which could have been reduced, but I guess it was to build the bond with the viewers immersing into the pandora pleasure. For me even this was a pleasure and I felt fine to spend a few more minutes enjoying the unimaginable world and it's beautiful creatures. Overall I think it is a 9 out of 10 because of the experience and the message it gives, the 1 point I could not give it is for the drags it had during the climax, but definitely feel it's a one time watch for everyone. But for me I would love to immerse into the water and explore those Islands some more times and can watch part 2 more than twice."
"Let me start by saying i am not particularly a movie and popcorn type of person, but...As there are 4 Avatar Movies, James Cameron has introduced new characters to give the movie more depth.The character build up on newbies is amazing, emotional and gives you a warm fuzzy feeling. The story and plot is fantastic, bearing in mind there are more avatar movies incoming and this movie leads perfectly onto Avatar 3 and 4.But above all are the visuals, a masterpiece, a Mona lisa of cgi movies and james cameron at the pinnacle of his creativity.Do not question yourself (if you should watch it because of the long runtime) because believe you me when it finishes you will think to yourself you want MORE and wont even notice where the time went!"
"The visuals are amazing. Next level, even. Absolutely beautiful. With today's technological advances, a movie with such huge budget should certainly nail their graphics. This movie did just that.And that's unfortunately all they did. The movie's plot was extremely ordinary. You felt no connection to the characters. You wanted to feel sad and angry for the losses and lives lost, but you just can't. None of the events were compelling enough to create that bond between the viewers and the characters to induce such reactions. The events were also so cliche and predictable.This felt like a case of a movie trying to tell too many stories to set up a sequel."
"This could have been broken up into 2 separate movies released at the same time & I would have gladly paid to see part 1 & part 2. I was in physical pain from sitting for almost 4 hours. Any movie longer than 90 minutes is too long. Other than that it was a great entertaining film. People who complain about the writing are probably wannabe critics or snooty film students. I'm excited to see what Disney does with it in the ride department. Go see this movie with your family, it's a fun night out and will give an opportunity to talk to your kids about global issues related to the destruction of natural resources."
"Visualy Stunning just like the first film, but cant see why it took so long to make a sequal, its the same story, with weaker characters, the new charactrers lack substance, the old characters are uninteresting.I lost count of how many ""iconic"" scenes and characters from other films were ripped off, (Mad Max, Star Wars, Jaws, Moana, Free Willy, Jurrasic Park to name a few).Maybe my expectations are too high and I have been spoilt by so many wonderfull films with thought provoking plots and subtext.I felt that this film lacked either.If you are blessed with children and have been subjected to watching the same Disney film over and over again...
that feeling you get when the DVD case is pulled from the cabnet or shelf, or is being selected from whatever streaming service you have, that heavy sigh and the sinking of soulders, that feeling is how I would best describe Avatar 2."
"""Us and them"" is, yet still, the scenario which for a movie of 3.15 hours seems rather trivial to go through yet again..the things that save the story is the small, interesting bits between the ""sea-peopke"" and the ""forrest-people"" play out in the entire scenes..young blood meets young blood and old blood meeting old blood...this, surely enough, will give one higher expectations for Avatar 3 and the character development...all in all it gets 10 stars for effects and a ""wauw-experience"" but ""only"" 7 stars for the plot. Definitely top three of the mist beautiful movies...3D glasses is a must go-to."
"I'd say the watching expience was amazing from every angle. It had great visuals and it had emotional storyline which I personally loved. It was easy to just dive into the story within the story of the movie. It exceeded my expectations in every way. I find this movie not to deserve all of the hard critics on it.I feel that the only downside was that it was a tad bit too long and they could have packed the storyline a bit more together. However it is not that big of a downside because during the movie I couldn't really feel the time passing, because of the catching plot and mesmerizing visuals."
"There are a lot of illogical points in the film. In the first part we talked about the wonderful properties of crystals, which give infinite energy. So why don't people mine them when they've driven out the avatars? Why is planet Earth dying? How would millions of people live on Pandora if they needed oxygen? Why would people kill avatars if they weren't aggressive? Humans could simply live on another part of Pandora's planet. If avatars behaved aggressively, then that's another matter. What did they show about aging fluid, if it was not discussed further in the film? How did scientists initially learn about this liquid?"
"Overall I give it 9.7 I'm so enjoy to watch this. But are something miss... About the effect of plane landing (nothing wind effect).The second is when Spider broke the ship controller, people just watch not stop him just 1-2 people stop him.At least all is good.I like the grapich, sound, story, etc.For 3hour show it's so enjoying. I can watch this until the end and not feeling bored.And if you want to watch this, you should watch the first movie. If you not watching the previous movie you will feeling little bit confused about the story line, character, etc. You just can enjoy the grapic."
"I watched the first movie 3 times when it came out and 1 Month ago in ISense 3D.Then last week part 2 in ISense 3D.Now Yesterday part 2 in Imax.The Plot is forgetable, maybe 4 Stars, even part 1 is better there...was bored by having to watch it again yesterday.But the Difference between IMAX and ISense Experience is so big, im sitting here now to write this review.Do it in I-Max!!!The perception of Depth, the light, the details, all is much better in Imax Format, the difference is really strong.These techniques demand special expertise and dedication. And for 3D screening directors have only two options: Make it great, or leave it on the drawing board. Wearing 3D glasses for almost 3 hours in a theater is a hassle unless the movie is super great. As said before: ""Go IMAX 3D or Go Home""."
"It was a movie with marvellous visuals and demonstrated a very sad side to humanity. It was emotionally draining in the best way - in a way a movie should make you feel. Especially the scenes with the whales really affects you.My expectations were low given that it's a second movie... I find they generally tend to be worse than a first but in this case, James Cameron did not disappoint. It was absolutely fantastic. I normally find a 3+ hour movie long, but time flew by and you really get immersed.I really recommend going to the cinema to see it as the visuals will take you into the sea world."
"The movie is more than wonderful, it contains a very wonderful visual vision, but there is a lengthening of some events at the beginning, but the beauty of directing and the visual vision make it a more than wonderful experience, especially for a family. I highly recommend it.Some of the events have not ended, such as the causes of Kiri's power under water, the sacred tree, who her father is, the fate of ""spider"", and whether his father will return again (He will definitely come back from my point of view), so I expect a new part, which I hope will be soon.I recommend watching the movie in theaters using 3D, a more than wonderful experience."
I thought I could put aside a bad plot and enjoy the spectacle. We spend waaaaay too much time with Jake and his dumbass kids. The water scenes were neat but they were few and far between. 30 minutes of this film delivered cool visuals and a sense of wonder. The rest was a stale revenge plot.There was a different composer and the music is recycled instead of epic. It just wasn't immersive like the original was. The story felt extremely contained and didn't imply more was going on in the world.I haven't felt this let down by a theatrical release since The Last Jedi. It was insulting boring and derivative. It's the safest garbage Disney coulda pumped out.
The movie captivates from the get go with its stunning visuals and captivating cinematography. The technical workaround for the movie seems to make it a very pleasant experience for any viewer. The story is simple and predictable. 3 hours seems like a long time for the story line and they could have easily cut it short by 45 mins. Easily one of the best movies of the year. The movie is an experience in itself to watch in the big screen. The movie touches an emotional cord with the base storyline on family and the parents continuous struggle to keep their family safe.Final Thoughts: DON'T MISS THISOver all rating: 7*
"All in all, I think this is a top-notch special effects film, and the ecosystem and beautiful Marine life presented in the film made me feel as if it was real. However, the shortcoming of this film is that the narrative about the main character's family is too flat at the beginning, which makes people feel a little sleepy, and after watching it, I feel the plot is very strange. The narrative of human beings in this film is undoubtedly a failure, and there is no convincing reason for the audience to explain why human weapons are so fragile. I kind of understand that it's necessary for the plot of the movie, but I can't fool myself that this is really a weapon that humans will have 100 years from now. I also understand that Cameron wants to use this film to describe the growing up of the children, as a way to move forward into the third film. But the problem is that the family part is really boring. I gave this movie an 8 for the special effects (which are amazing in IMAX), but it's not really worth it."
"For some reason, the Avatar movies always attract large mainstream audiences and always are looked by skepticism for some people, saying that they are long and boring. Back in 2009, people were enthrilled in the movie theater and went in mass but, three years later or so, boom! It just was Pocahontas mixed with Dances with Wolves. So, what is happening here? After watching this sequel, I've started to figuring it out. I don't know what it is but there is something in these movies that grabs you in. The first Avatar probably has one of the most technically immersive visuals ever made, and this one is not too far off. Yes the VFX have been improved to unknown levels, but honestly, if they had remained stationary since 2009 I wouldn't complain: they look unbelievably good, even to this day. Still, you cannot deny that this movie has the most organic alien environment ever. Sometimes the Na'vi look so real that they look like blue people with weird noses, and I'm not saying it as a negative. The technology has also been upgraded so much since the first movie: you got robocrabs, inflatable harpoons, weird mechas... So, you dispense eye candy and, when people are fed up, they start to reject it. Now, with the inertia of the first one, it already has appeared the backlash. But seriously. Is it all good? Is it all bad? I don't think so. In fact, I think this sequel is superior to its predecessor in many aspects, although I am not so sure overall.So, what is the main problem of this movie? Funnily enough, I agree with the majority here: this movie needed to enter the editing room so bad. It is 3h 12 min long and there are scenes that are completely distracting and baggy. For example, there is an action sequence in the first act that could have been resolved without the entirety of it. And that would've given the movie a lot of momentum. This is later confirmed when you find out the third act is already full action, and further so considering that there are already 2 kidnappings in it, so why did you need another one in the first act? Ask the writers I guess. Another example of that? The whales in the second act. A lot of sequences with a lot of whales, being one of them the ""main protagonist"" of the pack. The number of sequences could have been trimmed off into one or two, and that would've made the second act much tighter. So yeah, that's a problem.I know some people want to hear me complain about the characters but I have to admit that, this time around, the characters are vastly superior. Jake and Neytiri children actually enrich the dynamic of the cast and they all have some distinct traits, maybe with the exception of Neteyam, who is very bland as an old brother. Jake's character seems different and a little more compelling: he's tough, but vulnerable and coward at the same time, and he has some character drama with Neytiri, something that was either absent or poorly executed in Avatar 1. Quaritch is better too, since he is much more threatening, charming, sadistic and tough, and he has much of a bigger role in the action. It's true that his character is retconned like hell and he is a very basic villain (yet), but I thought the concept was interestingly enough for this kind of movie. What about Spider (the human, adopted son)? Well, his character has a lot of problems, specially towards the end of the movie, and the acting felt alarmingly amateurish, but I think his struggle and motivations are more defining than people would like to admit. So yeah, I don't like Spider. On the other hand, you have Kiri, who is probably the best character of the entire film. Yes, she is voiced by a 73 year old woman, but that didn't really bother me. I thought that added an aura of weirdness and mistery to her, and the character has such a meditative and ethereal, yet mature personality... Lastly, I wanna talk about Neytiri. Now, in the first movie, she was an absolutely show-stealer. She almost saved the movie by herself. She is wonderfully well casted, acts great, sounds great and feels three-dimensional. Actually I think that, in the sequel, you can still see how great Zoe Saldana is and how much she brings to the character. For example, there is a scene where you see her emulating the sound of an animal to warn her children that she is there. Also, she is very prejudiced towards the sky people and their ways, even after all those years. All these character seeds are fine, but I have to say, they really disrespected her character in the sequel. She barely appears, with some exceptions, until the third act, and when she does she only serves as emotional support for her kids and Jake, and she cries too much for her own good. Sometimes it's justified, sometimes it's not. Eventually, Neytiri is still one of the most compelling characters, but sadly they squandered her enormous potential. The characters, overall, are decent, clearly an improvement but I must warn you: there are some rotten apples in the way, like the ones I already mentioned, and some forgettable ones, like the youngest daughter, Edie Falco's character or Kate Winslet's character.What about the plot? Uh boy, it's time to get rough around here. The movie has a serious case of sequel-itis. Meaning, great chunks of it feel like a retread of the first one, and there is literally A TON of examples of this. Here's five of them:1. The annoying exposition in the beginning through a voiceover.2. The literal repetition of shots from Avatar 1. I repeat, LITERAL.3. The action sequences in the forest. Again, if they had trimmed them down it would have been much much better, but instead Cameron just copy-pasted them, which it's dumb.4. The catch-phrases such as ""Think fast"" or ""You are not in Kansas anymore"".5. The excessive amount of filler scenes just to give ""wow factor"" in the second act.Beyond that, the movie is filled with plot conveniences, more evenso than in the first movie, and there is some head-scratching lines that don't make much sense. In fact, there is a plot hole so big that it brings the whole movie down (and it's not the one everyone is talking about). So, the Sully family moves out of the forest to live with the reef people. I won't spoil anything, but the reason they have to leave the Omaticaya behind when they flee Quaritch doesn't make a lick of sense. And that also brings me to Quaritch. Why does he only care about the Sully family? I know Jake is known to be the leader of the Na'vi insurrection and that's the mission Quaritch is being assigned with, but why not ""engage"" with the Omaticayas in the forest? Why leave them alone? I mean, this plot hole is so big it could fit a space shuttle, for God's sake. So, the problem is not that the plot is simple, as some people say, but that it is neglected in very important plot points, and when you got so much time ahead of you to refine your script, there is absolutely no excuse for that.I also want to talk about some character moments that really don't go anywhere, like the scene when Kiri had a seizure. This scene seemed very pointless and only helped to engorge the runtime. Maybe it's gonna be relevant in future sequels, but it doesn't quite fit this one.With all that, that doesn't mean that the script is terrible. To be fair, it is much less of a lackluster than the first one and there are some character seeds that flourish later on the movie that I thought were cool, like the relationship between Neytiri and Spider, or Spider and Kiri. And the way they tie the whale subplot and the water training with the third act was good enough, so it is not the worst script in the world.The action. Boy, you are not ready to witness the full display of it in this movie. You basically got one hour of pure, unadulterated, creative action, where James Cameron pulls no punches and the characters go ballistic. It is, probably, the best action he is ever directed since True Lies. And I know people are saying it's a rehash of Titanic but the truth is, he uses the resources he has to improve upon that formula and setting the fleeting environment as a battleground. So that is something that absolutely had to be done. Is it better than the action in the first one? In every aspect, except in one. The action in the first Avatar feels much more grand and epic as the stakes were huge, so every single animal and Na'vi was part of it, and that's something that is somehow lost in the sequel. But don't get me wrong, bigger scope doesn't always mean better.The score was ok. They bring back a lot of tracks from the first movie, and they add some piece that has a sense of beauty and grace, like the Songcord by Zoe Saldana, and specially underwater the soundtrack is good. There is, on the other hand, a lot of generic string pieces, which is unavoidable I guess. James Horner's soundtrack in the first movie is slightly better, by a smidge though.All in all, don't trust the so-called ""critics"", nor the eye candy. At the end of the day, this is just an action movie about family set in another world with alien species. As a sequel, it works well enough, and as a movie, it's passable. It is riddled with problems? Yes. It fixes some problems of the first one? Yes. It creates others? Yes, a few of them. 5.3/10."
"Families can talk about Avatar's revolutionary special effects. Do they overwhelm or support the movie's story? How does the portrayal of the Na'vi affect the movie's emotional impact?What themes does Cameron consistently work into his films? Compare the strong female characters in Avatar, Terminator, and Titanic. Any similarities?What political messages is Cameron exploring in the movie? How are its themes relevant to what's going on in today's world? Do you think these messages will stand the test of time?Why is it important to respect different cultural groups and treat their traditions and practices as valid and important?How do the Na'vi and human allies use teamwork to achieve their goals? Why is that an important character strength?"
The longer than needed 3 hours+ goes by quicker than expected. Story flows as expected and really very few surprises with a very classic story arc that you will have seen before. This would have been ok if the characters stood out and made you care but also in this regard there is nothing out of the ordinary. After spending 3 hours with the Sully family I don't really feel I know them so well and most of them have left very little emotional impression which means it is hard to care (and look forward to a 3rd movie). Technically well made and well crafted overall.In summary feels like a decent way to kill a couple of hours and a good excuse to eat some popcorn but not that memorable.

"I am so happy that you made a second movie and I am longing for the 3 movie, it was worth waiting 13 years for! :)
Everything was good in the movie.Thank you so much for this wonderful, amazing, breathtaking, emotional, beautiful movie from the bottom of my heart!I am gonna buy this movie when it comes out in Blu-ray, I can watch this movie over and over again without getting tired of it.I don't understand how people can give this movie a low rate, it really breaks my heart that people don't appreciate this movie, don't let them effect you because this movie is one of the greatest movies of all times! It's definitely worth watching!I want to thank everyone that made this movie/ sincerely you fan."
"Already one of the better movies this year. It has a great story and really takes its time to present its themes. While there are too many characters for this movie, so much in fact that I can't remember them by name, it has great world building and cinematography. Overall, it did what it was suppose to do. James Cameron displayed his beautiful creativity with the visuals and the action sequences. The plot of the movie is where I think it suffered the most, but having seen the first one that also had a similar issue, that was what I expected walking into the theater. It's still a good movie that deserves at least one watch."
"I didn't expect much less than from the first movie but when I watched it I was kinda disappointed.Scenery looked very very beautiful. I watched it in 4D and I think that's the only way this movie hast to be watched. After it finished my first thought was that it must be very boring if I didn't watched it like that.The story is very simple, not much different from the first movie. The Sky people attack on Na'Vi but now on the water instead of in the jungle. Everything else is the same.The thing that bothered me the most is who to hell funds all the army, machinery, flight to distant planet just so one bad guy could kill one good guy?! Who approved this? Why does he needs to kill him? They now have different rare pricey resource, they don't need the Unobtainium anymore. I guess the movie is made for teenager but couldn't they make some better storyline?The biggest difference between two movies is that Jake Sully was not badass like before."
"I loved this movie enough to want to create accounts on here, Rotten Tomatoes, etc. Just to help boost the audience ratings, because I honestly have no clue how anyone could truly believe this movie is anything short of spectacular.I love the first Avatar, so so much. It still always makes me cry. It's a world I've always wished to be able to exist in, being based on the Lemurians I've always felt so connected to. I love the characters, the story, the messages, and the visuals are of course absolutely stunning.Avatar: The Way of Water however... there is not another movie that gives me a sense of longing this intense outside of the Harry Potter franchise. I mean that. It was worth the wait. I fell more in love with this universe and these characters than I ever could have anticipated. I left my heart on the theater floor, truly.I cried through over half the movie the first time I saw it. Tears of joy and tears of gut wrenching sadness alike. The second time I saw it, I cried even more. Seeing the movie through a new lens, with all the hindsight and context of the story throughout watching, soaking up every detail I could, noticing things I didn't before, consciously paying attention to things I wanted more insight into, it was just as enjoyable as watching it wish fresh eyes. And being already so attached to the characters and the story, I was certainly more emotional.The whole experience is so immersive, so ethereal. It deserves to just be appreciated for what it is. A beautiful story, that in my opinion doesn't require any more drama within the plot in order to have you completely captivated during the entire film, and also should not be cut any shorter. I really have a hard time viewing this story through the lens of a critic in that sense, and I think that speaks to how special it is.Because why on earth would anyone want less detail? Less of the moments that give you more insight into the characters and allow you to form deeper understanding and attachment to them and the plot? Why would you want less immersion, less stunning visuals of this gorgeous and quite literally otherworldly place? Why does every story need to be constant chaos, be it euphoria or rage or heartache, in order to be entertaining?Life isn't like that. We're allowed to have moments of calm weaved in and out of the more tumultuous parts of life. Why should the stories we love, be any different in that sense? If we love them, their characters, their universes, the visuals and imagination of it all, why does it need to be constant go, go, go in order for us to enjoy it? If we love the story, don't we want all the context in the world in order to understand it better?The best movies are those that allow us the deepest glimpses into the worlds they take place within, and the character that are a part of them. They're visually captivating and immersive, beautiful even when they're ugly. They are more than a mere distraction, they make you feel the full scope of emotions because of how deeply you connect to and are invested in the story. They are those that leave us wanting to theorize and predict and create headcannons, they leave you curious, wanting more no matter how tightly they tie things into a bow at the end or how much they leave up to interpretation.Because you love them enough that they leave you yearning to know and understand and connect as much as humanly possible to the story and characters. You wonder about the existence of the characters behind the scenes on the screen, the words on the page. They're comforting even in their chaos. They help us connect to deeper parts of ourselves, and create new ones. You miss them. You want the whole world to know about them. You want to find communities if others to share your passion with, who understand. They make life better on about a million different levels.That is this story for me. I could not be more grateful that it exists."
"I think it was the most awaited movie in recent times. Even after 1 month from the launch, the halls are full. This movie is definitely better than the first one. The closing of the family and the appearance of the children made the story emotional and magical. The effects are surprising and the landscapes spectacular. The strange part was when the ship started to sink. The fact that I knew that Kate Winslet was playing and that it was also directed by James Cameron, it left me with the impression that I was watching Titanic. Anyway, Zoe Saldana is my favorite for her expressiveness and passion."
"watch online movie freeIt's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly."
"I 've just created an IMDB account just so I could review this movie! I loved the first one and I can't believe how much I got into this movie as well! The 3D was amazing, the CGI, the pacing, the storyline... all of it! It had some ""bad"" dialogs with the character named Spider but that's it. Like what did I just watch? I absolutely loved it! To anyone who is thinking of watching it, just so you know, I wish I could already forget it and watch it again. Wow... So glad I came back to the cinemas for this movie.A masterpiece... I could watch another 3 hours of it and I wouldn't even complain.Can't wait for the next one!!!"
"Movie could've been shorter, its streached a lot at certain points, but overall it's a must watch movie, visual effects were absolutely nailed. So I have no complains about 3D decision,acting was amazing in the whole movie I loved the acting of Jake sully . It had a very important message about our society you name it ""racism"" can Jake overcome all these barriers and defeat his new enemy but on a different turf , but is it better than the first part??? I don't think so. That's why I am giving it a 7/10. It's a 3 hour plus movie so make sure you have a good sleep before you come to watch. It's a spoiler free review."
"Avatar 2: The way of water is an American science fiction film directed by James Cameron. The film is not based on a book. The film is set in the USA and was released on 14 December 2022. Avatar 2 begins by telling the story of Sully family, the problems that follow them, what they must do to stay safe and a lot of fight to stay alive. I love the acting in this film. My favorite character is Jack Sully because he is brave and he never gives up, he is close to his family. The main role is Jack Sully and Neytiri. The film is very good because there is always suspense, we never get bored and the 3hours pass very quickly."
In order to truly appreciate this visual masterpiece one MUST watch it in 3D for the most subversive stunning cinematic experience overall!!! Lots of mind blowing CGI scenes in this epic thriller of a ride! The Way of Water really takes you on a voyage much like the title represents. It's almost as if National Geographic joined forces with Cameron with the best of both worlds (Land and Water) (Earth and Pandora) PUN INTENDED!!! Wherever the plot is lacking the visual effects mofe than make up for the cinematic experience! So do yourself and your loved ones a favor and GO check it out in 3D in case I haven't made it clear for the holidays!!!
"The greatest direct of all times shows us the real situation that is happening now. We are all one family, but the power, money and possession is killing our soles. I watch the film and I keep on thinking how many people were killed by Americans. This is a tragedy of this century. Lies, and informational war. People are loosing their analytical skills, unable to protect themselves physically, navel to read books, unable t see behind their tv box, are becoming worthless for the planet. Let's be friends, let's work, let's see the deepness of our patience. Let's work also to become better, see problems As violence in ourselves."
"The first half of the movie is spectacular and amazingly fast. The story moves so quick you wonder what's in store. However, the second half stalls. The underwater scenes are mesmerising and surreal to say the least. On a completely different note, we are made to explore the vulnerable side of the second son of Jake while the elder one has formed no connection with the audience and yet it is him that is given the sympathy angle towards the end. The end fight drags and drags. Kudos to Cemeron for paying homage to the sinking ship. All in all, it could been a 4k experience but 3D did make it better. It's definitely worth a watch."
"New Avatar, the most awaited 2022 film. Was it as good as everyone expected? In my opinion yes and no. At first sight, everything looks perfect, great special effects, fantastic actors. Esspecialy Zoe Saladana she played Neytiri so emotional and she did her job perfrct. The music and the lyrics support the plot. But, in my opinion, the plot was really boring and predictable, apart from one unexpected plot twist. The characters were shallow and just boring. The music and the lyrics support the plot. Music gives this film an enigmatic and magical atmosphere. I recommend this film, because it was pleasant to watch."
"Directed by James Cameron, an action movie is a sequel to the first Avatar movie from 2009. While the first part is definitely a must-see, The Way of Water was pretty disappointing. The plot was just confusing and I am still not quite sure what was the point of that film. Sure, Jake has to protect his family so he seeks help from other communities. But what lead to that? It all happened so fast even though the movie was long. Too long. I'm gonna admit, it didn't feel long, but at some point I just gave up and went to sleep. Although, the movie has a few good pieces. For example, the music wasn't too bad, Neytiri's song was actually enjoyable and I really liked it. The special effects were absolutely breathtaking and amusing, I definitely can't complain about that. The Avatars and Pandora are beautiful and the action scenes were pretty realistic. The acting was fantastic. I'm surprised at how well someone could portray a furry. The actors did a great job and played their characters perfectly. We've got an emo teen daughter (who was by the way played by a seventy-three year old actress), an edgy son, an annoying baby sister and the eldest brother accompanied by a strict father and a loving mother, both ready to sacrifice their lives for the sake of their children. And I need to mention once again that Jack Champion portrayed Spider really well. I actually believe that he's a furry.Overall, the film wasn't the best and definitely not what I was expecting. Not after the original Avatar movie. I wouldn't watch it again."
"A film called ,,Avatar 2"" was produced by James Cameroon. The multi-layered script was
written in cooperation with Josh Friedman, Amanda Silver, Rickiem Jaff and Shane Salerno.Whole plot twist was really interesting and gripping. People who landed on Pandora brought
Sully's family trouble, during avatar's life changes many surprising moments in the film
occurred. Special effects were on a high level, obviously, most of them were made by the
use of a computer, but it conveyed spectator captivating feelings. Even special effects make
the film a worthwhile watch. Justifiably first part of the film is a box-office success. Music
was also an important part, it put viewers in a proper mood and made an action more
exciting. Actor skills were hilarious, their acting was compelling and professional. Zoe
Saldana did a very good job as the mother Neytiri. Avatar 2 is a breathtaking and compelling
story about family love and strength. I definitely recommend this film."
"The new Avatar:The way of water shows the long gap between movies with a prologue that explains what happened after the humans retreated from Pandora. Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldãna) start a family as the new leaders of the Omaticaya tribe. That family grows to include three biological and one adopted children. After the ""sky people"" led by general Ardmore (Edie Falco) who came back as an avatar, Jake and Neytiri decide to exile themselfs for safety. These scenes were really unexpected but as soon as they met the Metkayina tribe the plot started to deliver a lot of emotions. The way these avatars show the bond with nature is amusing but as soon as the RDA found this place everything started to get tense. The story was full of tension. One of the most surprising moments in the film occurs when one of the sully kids die. The acting pf the actors adds a lot to the film. This production is full of wonderrful characters. The script was written by James Cameron who was also a director on the plan. He did a very good job. The music in the film underlines mood and connects scenes but the lirycs of the song sung by The Weeknd on the ending screen really support the plot. The film brought tearsto my eyes. I definitely recommend this film to everyone."
"The plot actually was not that bad, yet it was definitelly too long for me and some threads were taking too much time than it could. I am not going to lie I was expecting something else, but still it was okay. The effects were amazing, sometimes I was speechless and shocked how realistic and incredible some moments were and music was fantastic too. I was impressed how well did it match to movie. Acting was a masterpiece, nothing more to say. Overall the film was enjoyable, yet it is just not my type of movies and it was way too long for me, but for someone that enjoys long ones, it will be great option to choose."
"I was exited to watch ""Avatar 2: The way of water"" directed by: James Cameron. But after the cinema I was shocked. The plot was totally confusing and I couldn't understand many parts of the story. Also the film was a way to long! However the background crate a certain atmosphere, sound in background and actors play was made with passion. I really enjoyed Zoe Saldana. She does very good job as a Neytiri. Combining informations together, I enjoyed film a lot, but it was unoriginal (I never saw a plot like that before) and poignant (I almost cried after the death of Neteyam), but also far-fetched and a little silly."
"In my opinion, Avatar 2 is a good movie and I agree with the overall rating of 7.3 out of 10
First of all, the special effects are incredibly well done, after all, we've been waiting for this movie for about 10 years. The whole movie was too long because 3 hours is crazy. The fight performances are great, and it's worth mentioning that the music conveys character to the whole movie and the action. In my opinion Avatar 2 is a bit overrated, but still quite an enjoyable movie, worth seeing
James Cameron did a really good job same as the first part now we have to wait for the next parts hopefully the next parts will be even better than the previous ones."
"Review
Film Avatar: The Way of Water is the long-awaited sequel to the cinematic masterpiece from 2009.There was a huge uproar around the second part, expertly directed by James Cameron himself, but
to be honest I didn't go to the cinema with specific expectations, so surprisingly I found more
positives than negatives in it.Of course, despite ALL the actions that don't really make much sense to me - that were etcher
confusing by lack of more precise explanations (examples? No problem! What happened to the past
plan for Pandora? They'll just forget it like nothing? What's going on with the people who hunt these
aquatic creatures? And okay, people knew quite a lot of Pandora's wildlife back then, but they were
still isolated on land far from the sea -- or I'm just missing some really important things? Also,
someone was wondering how long such masks of air can last?), or they were just were clichéd and
irritating with abrupt shortcuts and simple solutions (ex. Miraculous fishes for rescue). What's more
we can't forget about the whole reason why we have this film anyway - a brilliant plan to... take
revenge, yes, this whole mess is to kill one ex-soldier who betrayed them, that's like the definition of
what a deep pettiness and envy looks like, don't you think?Okay, but let's pass it by- so that mean this film has nothing to offers? WRONG!On the other hand the visuals of this film deserve a special words of affirmation, the stunning SGA
that sometimes feels so realistic, detailed and polished, amazing skin and landscape animation.Absolutely admiring shots of the sunset over the water, I still can't pass by the underwater fragments
and thoughtful camera movements, showing its vast. Music that fits and underlines powerful and
emotional moments. And the last, grandly chosen cast showed all the emotions of their characters
and brought them to life.At the end, it was a well-written and conducted story about family, bringing up relationships and
situations from our own lives that are sometimes complicated and transform them into a audience
pleaser entertainment.On a scale from 1 to 10, I give this film 8,5."
Not bad just when it's trying so hard to surpass the first one it falls short... first one was more powerful and better action and story... I think it should have continued we're it left off at the end we're they finally got everything ok... but nope got like 5 kids!! It's been 10 years and when avatar 1 ended and I sed to myself I want to see avatar 2 this is not what I imagined I wanted a slow movie something with no action turn it into a drama for all I care... it felt like a rehash of the first avatar not a continuation I think he forgot how he ended the first one or something we already went through this action and the drama literally It will always be better in the first one it would have been nice to see him take a left turn. Not a remake but hoo knows there is still 3 more avatars so I'm bound to like one just not this one.
"Finally got around to watching the movie. I did it for nothing. The first part is TOP. The second one is nothing special. So I would just advise you to rewatch the first part of the movie and stop there.In general, I have no complaints about the visual part. But I do have a complaint about the plot. It's kind of weak, especially compared to the first part. The feeling that the whole movie is just a preparation of the viewers for the next part. A very long preparation.So if you want to get visual pleasure, watch this movie. If the plot is important to you but not critical - you can watch it too, but without inflated expectations. If the plot is critical, just skip this part."
"This film is visually stunning. It simply has to be seen on the biggest screen possible in 3d. That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira. I know I haven't seen 2001 in imax so maybe that would knock this film out the park but who knows.I'm probably gonna see this movie 3 or 4 more times at least in imax even if it means I'm broke it's just one of those films that is just breathtaking."
"Spoil alert!Literally one of the best film in the past 10 years in my opinion. Although the plot is kinda too fast with some unsatified and questionable parts (such as why Quarich must obsess over chasing Jack family or what is the role of the Metkayina clan in Act 3), I really love the family factor of the film.The family love in the movie is deep and touching, I really like the depiction of each member of Sully's family, especially Neteyam and Lo'ak.Amazing visual effects, 10/10. 13 years ago I fell in love with the world of Pandora and 13 years later I love this fantasy world even more."
"The start of the movie is not understandable if you haven't watched Avatar 1 like me, the first
45 minutes is the time to understand all of the stuff.After this time, you will see the beauty of this fictional world called Pandora, because your mind won't be occupied with thinking about the plot.Nevertheless, the plot is exciting, and this world can evoke our feelings and emotions.If we are talking about visual effects and graphics in this movie,they are brilliant and I'm really impressed by what I have seen. Acting is on the highest level, because it's not an animation, but the recording of human moves.In my opinion this movie is totally worth watching and I can wholeheartedly recommend going to the movie theater."
This sequel to Avatar is able to give a fresh perspective of the impact the RDA has on Pandora and also the lives of the Navi. The family dynamic of the Sulleys is a nice touch as it shows how a family may be raised during a time of war. Once again the RDA as a whole shows impressive technology and their increased need to find another home for the people of Earth will surely bolster their aggression going forward. This movie is definitely the stepping stone needed after 13 years to continue the story a lot of people (including myself) been waiting to see unfold. Glad it was successful and we can get those next two movies (a lot sooner)
"Good movie for what it is but don't expect it to be outstanding and one of the best films to date. Unfortunately although the visuals and plot of the movie was actually pretty good, it did indeed have its flaws.Flaws:
The movie didn't continue on from where the first Avatar ended. I expected that it would show the end scene of the first movie and it continue from there. It didn't so I was left confused as to what was happening on screen. For this reason reason it felt like a stand alone film rather than a sequel with its own plot.Another flaw was that the film focused only on the Avatars and not the humans. I know for many that's good and what people only want to see but as the first film showed humans entering the machine and turning into Avatars, to not see that AT ALL in the second one was pretty odd. It was like they completey disregarded that idea.Overall it's worth the watch as it is a film that is better experienced in the cinema than at home however just don't go with high hopes."
"This film was gorgeous to watch and I believe it almost seamlessly followed the plot from the previous film. I've always loved the first movie because of how it brought attention to colonization and genocide in an alien universe to make the audience more aware of the past and calk attention to government action in the future; and this movie did the same as well. Plot wise I did think that the general coming back was a bit of a reach but in the end it seemed to work out. I also would've loved to see more on Kiri's spiritual relationship to Eywa but I think viewers were purposely left with questions for the third movie. This movie set up the next movie perfectly as well and I can't wait to see the path the next movie follows. However, considering how long it takes for the Avatar movies to be produced we'll have to wait awhile to see what happens next."
"Cameron knows how to capture every scene of this 3+ hour long spectacle.This is one of the few movies delicately crafted for the big screen and for 3D, too.Do yourself a favour and go see it in 3D on the biggest screen available.All the labour that has gone into every scene, all the big budget really shows.The story, well, it has been told before.Nothing ground-breaking but still solid action cinema with family and ecology thrown in for good measure.Let's face it.No one watching avatar expected a match for Shakespeare or Goethe's Faust here.I surely did like Avatar 2 and if jaw-dropping 3D visuals plus a solid story are your cup of tea, then go watch this movie in 3D."
"Non stop action, it's part of a trilogy so there is always going to be a connection from one film to another ... I've read plenty of reviews on this and loads people complaining it wasn't different enough ... bonkers if you ask me.So much going on and loved the new characters, hits hard and sends a great message home, visual stunning and so immersive in colour. It's a step up from the first one ... Cameron and his team have already started on the next film so roll on 2024 for the 3rd instalment. I'll be happily in the queue to sit on the biggest screen available with popcorn in hand and a costaSpoiler the coronal isn't dead so he will be in the 3rd film... ""eye roll""10/10."
"Stunning visuals...Great story and characters...Great work again by the team lead by an inspiring director... can't wait for a conclusion..wow!! A Must watch!! Watched it with my 9 year old daughter in 2D for not being a fan of watching movies in 3D, and guess what!! She instantly complained, why I didn't book tickets for 3D, am still listening and now finally I have been convinced by her to watch it again specifically in 3D, for which I have booked tickets again, we will be watching it again tomorrow!! I recommend everyone to watch it asap before it moves out of the theatres. Go for it people..don't wait!!"
"Avatar: The Way of Water is a stunning visual masterpiece that is sure to leave audiences in awe. The film, directed by James Cameron, is the long-awaited sequel to the groundbreaking 2009 film Avatar.The story takes place in the same world as the first film, Pandora, but with new characters and a new plot that expands upon the rich world-building of the original. The film centers around the return of the human protagonist, Jake Sully, who is now a fully-realized Avatar and leader of the Na'vi tribe. Alongside the Na'vi, Jake must fight against a new threat to Pandora in the form of a ruthless mining company that is determined to exploit the planet's resources at any cost.The special effects in this film are truly breathtaking. The world of Pandora is brought to life with stunning detail and realism, making it feel like a living and breathing place. The Avatar characters, both human and Na'vi, are incredibly lifelike and expressive, and the action sequences are both thrilling and visually stunning. The film's use of 3D technology adds an extra layer of depth to the already immersive world, making it feel even more real.The performances in the film are top-notch, with Sam Worthington reprising his role as Jake Sully and giving a powerful and emotional performance. Zoe Saldana, as the Na'vi warrior Neytiri, is equally impressive and brings a sense of strength and vulnerability to the character. The new cast members, including Kate Winslet and Cliff Curtis, also deliver strong performances and add new layers to the story.The film also explores important themes such as the importance of preserving the environment, the consequences of exploiting natural resources, and the power of unity and teamwork. It is a powerful and thought-provoking film that will leave audiences contemplating the message long after the credits have rolled.In conclusion, Avatar: The Way of Water is an incredible film that is not to be missed. It is a visual masterpiece that is sure to leave audiences in awe, and it features a powerful story with important themes. The special effects, performances, and world-building are all top-notch and make for an immersive and unforgettable cinematic experience. This is a must-see film for fans of the original Avatar and for anyone looking for an epic and visually stunning film."
"Visuals are top and really bring you all the wonderful underwater experiences. There are several moments I can experience the awe as I did from Avatar 1. And great credits should be given to the team knowing the challenges of getting all the water effects done perfectly for a 3D experience. Definitely worth it. Now the story is something that is okay but is not something that can intrigue you too much. It flows well though. One particular thing that I would like to add is that the 2 is really great for family, and especially for families emigrating away from their hometowns and settling down in an unfamiliar territory. There are elements of conflicts, lack of belonging, building confidence, and eventually getting through at all cost. Nice to bring kids along and watch."
"Half a hour Too long. A lot of unnecessary scenes. The scene at the end was too long. Dying of some character is unnecessary. You really have to re watch the first before this otherwise you will be scratching your head. Think it's trying to portray the protection of animal species which is good. The plot was ok, love patag the sea creature though. What a legend. Probably portraying how evil humans are. Need to do something to protect the planet. I think the first one portray forest protection, second one against ocean over farming? Which is great and I get it.If I am stuck in a situation 20 hours flight I wouldn't rewatch it."
"Just breathtaking, mind blowing, surprising, great art. The details, both sound an picture. Wow. The script is well written. The actors are well picked and delivering quality entertainment. Additionally this film is in 3D. Fantastic experience for the oldies like my self and for the youngsters as well. My daughter lived this movie. We watched the first Avatar twice this week to be prepared for the sequel. The time just flies by... we were not bored. The movie delivers action, romance, drama, a bit of comedy and great science fiction. As good as the first one,.,, if not even better. If you haven't seen it... don't wait. Move your couchy ass back to the cinema!!!"
"Let's start off with the pros, the cgi, the music and overall ambiance is amazing.I personally prefer to experience these feelings while playing a game, where I can explore and live the fictional world, etc, but I get it. It looks good.The plot (spoilers), here is where everything goes downhill.On the first movie, Jake Sully is brought to Pandora to fill in his brother shoes (avatar), they explain the investment cost and time taken to make the avatar, it's so complicated that it would be better to train him than to start from zero with a new scientist. We understand. But now? It doesn't matter, they're reviving grunts and making them avatares for no purpose at all. Even reviving the scientists behind all the data about Pandora with make more sense.The coronal and they're unit, who do they respond to? What's the purpose of their investment? What's their mission? To hunt a Navi family?Earth is trying to move to Pandora as it is dying, why are they spending resources on the coronal? It doesn't make any sense. And this is the main plot.Final scene, water avatars are attacking the human ship, and they seem to be winning with the help of the whale, but out of nowhere, everyone is gone, only the Sully family are there, why didn't they surround and finish the enemy? Where did they go? It doesn't make sense.Later they appear holding hands with Jake Sully saying they are home etc, so they're alive, they just left the battle? It seems sloppy6/10 (because I'm nice)Thank you for reading."
"I give it major cred for the visuals. Seamless cgi, vibrant colors, and beautiful environment.. but the story itself? Mediocre. So many sub plots that had no meaning and conversations that were unnecessary. Watch it if you want a fun and long movie to fill your Friday night. But personally I'll never watch it again.I'm honestly surprised it has 7.9 stars. The entire movie was set at a fast pace hoping to create a sense of urgency, but you don't really feel for the characters because there's so many of them to keep track of. Also, the entire point of the movie was that Jake would save his people and family, but obviously he would be followed wherever he went. Seems pointless for him to leave in the first place."
"Overall the movie was decent in my opinion. The visual arts definitely make it worth watching in theatres. The story line was unfortunately similar to the first one, mainly depicting and criticizing the imperialist mindset of the Americans and the use of force to obtain what they want through war. Story and war aside, movie is beautifully shot, acting was good, and the film is consistent at showing cutting edge visual creations and the use of water. I left the theatre with an appreciation for the creativity more than anything else. It's a long movie, could have been shorter for the story line.. however for the beautiful cinematic experience it felt like the right amount of time."
"I really liked the movie and the visuals but the fact that Kiri sounds like an old lady brought me out of the experience every time she was on screen. It wasn't just her voice either, she didn't speak like a teenager at all. Her whole performance felt like the meme ""how you doin, fellow kids?"". Very far from realistic if you ask me. I just don't get why they didn't use a young actress or at least aged her voice down. Why does Hollywood always seem to think that the most important thing is personal brand and reputation and that that far outweighs actual performance?Having all the characters speak with a dialect (apart from Sully) was also a bit weird. If anybody would speak differently it would be him (since it's not his first language) so why is he the only one who speaks perfect Navi (translated to English)?All in all a very good movie but I wish that the producers would have been less blinded by stardom and more true to the reality of things."
"I watched this movie which no expectation. The first part was +10 years ago, cgi and 3d was a new thing. Being 2022 it's more common in cinema and the annoying parts are known. That's why I watch it in 2D because over 3 hours 3D will make your brain turn in to a swearl. (Pricing is also ridiculous 13euro for 2d, 18,35euro for 3d. I mean that is not funny.)
Afterwards I was glad a choose this way. At least 1 to 1,5 hours of this movie is filled with scenes of CGI pornografy. Super boring scenes with avatar children swimming in the ocean for example which do nothing for the story.Then there is the story, very thin, stupid and full of wrong doing.Examples
the colonel threaten to kill the children 3 or 4 times ( can't reminder because it's stupid) if they do anything. All the time they do something and they are still not killed. For a fierce person like he has to be he is very soft.the story is humans (sky people) come to pandora to habitat the plant (moon) because earth is dying. But when they flee the trees the invasion is stopped. How does that work????at the beginning the humans come back with there space ships which start a huge inferno. But doesn't burn the total forest down. Some great firefighters.there is a part where you are watching a documentary about Japanese whale hunting. But then with dinosaur like whales for the most stupid thing there is money and making you immortal. What has this to do with invading the planet.You are told it's financing the invasion. Well earth is dying so I think money is not the thing to worry about.they train with the water people to hold there breath for long periods. Eventually they can. Say 20 minutes. But at the end in the ship they can do it for long than one minute.These are some examples of stupid story points.No where do the 4 stars come from. Well that is for me that the difference between real actors and cgi is harder to see. That makes it a advancement over movie one. And that take some real skill and tech.My recommendation wait for it to come to a streaming service. Then you can skip some parts, you have a more enjoyable movie."
"3 hours of (admittedly quite cool) special effects scenes strung together with almost no storyline at all.It's all such a cliché - bad guy is sent to kill good guy; good guy refuses to fight and goes into hiding; bad guy finds good guy and threatens his family; good guy fights bad guy and kills him; except the bad guy survives; cue sequelSo many pointless scenes that do nothing to advance or enhance the story. Pseudo whale hunts go on and on - we get it, the bad guys kill the friends of the good guys. Endless scenes of characters swimming around admiring strange creatures.The dialogue is appalling - all ""bro!"" and ""Go, go, go!"".The first Avatar was unusual with good SFX. This one seems just like a collection of those SFX scenes they couldnt fit into the first movie, but that cost too much to throw away.I won't be watching Avatar 3, that's for sure."
"Don't overthink the plot. Huge chunks of explanatory stuff was intentionally left out. The story is about family, and for that reason, the characters, and not the plot, were brought to the forefront. The characters are very rich (more on the level of a TV show than a movie). The editing is more aggressive than the original. All the fat was cut out. The characters and spectacle are front and center. This one is even more about aesthetics. It's a precisely executed adventure film that deeply immerses you into the rich universe. The CGI has leveled up a lot since the first, and there are shots that you can tell were obsessed over in ways few contemporary directors, other than George Miller and Cameron himself, are thinking about. You feel like you are there, and everything feels natural and authentic to the universe. Nothing feels contrived or out of place. The technology of the ""sky people"" is richly thought out, even more so than in the first, but never brought to the center of the narrative. This one - is about characters and archetypes. The archetypes span galaxies and feel familiar to our own world. Old foes return. New foes are introduced. Although the characters are richer compared to the first, the character building is more precisely executed. By the end of the movie, you know this family. That said, all of the character building is hidden within 3+ hrs of pure blockbuster spectacle. It's a Finding Nemo meets Jurassic Park type adventure, if you will. It's the first of several more sequels, so more character building is to be expected (think the pilot of a TV show) but it absolutely is an emotionally griping adventure that has the blockbuster feel that we've almost forgotten about. You are transported to this world, and taken on an epic adventure. No time is wasted with regard to pacing, and you can tell a lot of thought was put into every detail, so even the keenest of observers would feel the richness of the universe without needing to pass through the uncanny valley. The CGI is probably the best, smoothest, and most photorealistic CGI to date. It feels like thousands of RTX GPUs were rendering for hours just to create a few seconds of CGI for this film. You can especially tell in the faces and movements of the characters. It doesn't appear to be CGI. Also, there appears to be less still ""art"" backdrops and more moving camera 3D CGI compared to the original, which allows for the more immersive adventure story. The acting, across the board, is better than the original. Just don't go into this one expecting an overly complex story because that isn't what this one is about. My guess is that most of the expose will be done in the next installment given how much time was devoted to character building in this one. All that said, I can definitively say, it's a blockbuster. Imo, right up there with the best of the best. Jurassic Park, Avatar, the original Star Wars, Indiana Jones. It's Avant Garde with regard to adventure filmmaking, similar to the first, but better in almost all aspects. I saw it in RealD 3D and didn't notice any framerate issues or anything, but I would have preferred a larger screen with a wider aspect ratio. The aspect ratio on the screen I saw it on was too narrow for that type of spectacle. Maybe the IMAX 3D has a wider aspect ratio. Either way, the 3D was good and seemed appropriate for the immersive adventure movie that it is. I will probably see it again in IMAX 3D to compare. I usually don't do IMAX 3D because they do linear polarization (as opposed to circular polarization with RealD) so the quality of the 3D is more susceptible to where you are seated and how straight you keep your head. I've also experienced framerate issues with IMAX 3D and not with RealD. That said, if the IMAX is a wider format, then I would highly recommend that over the RealD, even if the 3D is not as good. Overall, it's a very good movie. There is not much to the story ala Mad Max Fury Road, but unlike Fury Road, the characters are rich, often times charming, and carefully built up (think closer to Stranger Things character richness). You can tell the things we learn about these characters will be part of later installments."
"Disappointed! Duration could be standard. Without reason and compact story line producer stretched the movie only on the basis of graphical contents and imaginations. Avatar 1st edition was far better with a strong story line. The producer and director should really re think about any next project or 3rd sequel. My ratings mostly based on graphical contents. Without it, I may even think of rating 4 or below. First big movie of 2023 gives me a very start. I don't know why most of the times a franchise or sequel always failed for big budget movies?! Kids may admire it, but rest audience should take pre caution."
"James Cameron's Avatar 2 successfully meets viewer expectations after over a decade since the arrival of the first movie. Ignore other reviews that are critical of its ""unoriginal plot.""Avatar 2 is focused on family. Everything in the script develops Jake and Neytiri by incorporating their newfound familial responsibility amidst the growing challenges that await them. The movie incorporates similar themes from the first movie such as colonialism, and ""other""-ing people by dehumanizing them.Pros:
-The movie pays intricate attention to detail
-The CGI/Motion Capture is groundbreaking
-Suspense is built and maintained throughout the entire movieCons:
-Parts of the movie suffer from a decline in pacing which eventually pick up when needed
-The movie leaves many questions unanswered."
"Mind-blowing, epic and thrilling to the end. Fantastic plot and acting by a formidable cast. Happily surprised with some cameos (Titanic style) and having Kate Winslet ... Haha!What stopped me from scoring 9 or 10 was that gruesome sequence of whaling, even though I am aware of the messages Cameron conveyed in this movie. That one alone shook me to the core. It has to be seen for awareness sake.The special effects are phenomenal and our species' madness + paradox are so well depicted. This movie should be certified at least 15 and not 12A... Unless violence is no longer perceived as taboo."
"The best film I've ever seen in cinema. I watched this in 3D & I was not a huge fan of the first film, but I went anyway as I was with others who really wanted to go & I'm so glad I did. This film had me fully engaged for the entire 3hr15min. It was entertaining, emotional & tear jerking. It's a must see. It also made me think there is a deeper meaning behind it all, the film portrayed how humans are killing Earth due to the destruction we are causing to our animals & land & therefore the humans are trying to take over Pandora. Such as real life we are looking to possibly move humans to mars or the moon because of how we've treated Earth. For me it was very sad to see how hurt the animals were in this film by humans, which is a true reflection on what we've done to animals & our land in the real world. James Cameron has done an incredible job!"
"With a direct representation of what's happening in the world today woven into this digital beauty, they really had a chance to tell a more thought provoking story.Humans mining the earth and robbing it of it's resources for profit and people starting to look at ancient native wisdom for answers,
They had a chance to rewrite this current story with in-depth characters and a progressive narrative. Instead what was delivered was a recycled cliché action movie that's been done over and over and over again! Snore! They didn't even bother giving the bad guys a look in, they were just simply there to fill in the space and eventually be killed.It was hopelessly boring and predictable, the only thing that held it up was the fact it looked astounding.Unfortunately for Avatar there's an impeccably high level of writing available in abundance through the median that is tv shows, audiences have a high standard now with so much amazing entertainment available. Let's hope they do better on the next one."
"Let's get past the first thing everyone will love in the movie - visual effects. Yes, they're excellent. But honestly, for someone like me who has been visiting the imax theatres almost every month since 2013 and has savoured epics like Dune and Blade Runner 2049, it wasn't enough. At all.The story is non-existent. It's shocking how people are rating this movie 10/10 and agreeing to the absolute lack of a story in the same review! The character development is non-existent. I would rate Black Panther: Wakanda forever 3 notches above Avatar 2 just for the incredible character arcs and performances. Avatar 2 lacks both. Speaking of Wakanda Forever, the oceans in Avatar 2 look like a video game! Why the hell is every organism bioluminescent?! Because that's the easiest way to make things look pretty. Not original at all. The dialogue delivery and background score is, well, so forgettable that I couldn't find any imdb review mentioning any of them.The story at the end of 192 mins of Avatar 2 seems like exactly the story we had before the first minute started - except that we have 5 kids now. I hope that Cameon wrote a story for the next 3 movies. Truly disappointed."
"Loved so much............Waiting for the next 1.Ake Sully and Ney'tiri have formed a family and are doing everything to stay together. However, they must leave their home and explore the regions of Pandora. When an ancient threat resurfaces, Jake must fight a difficult war against the humans.Avatar: The Way of Water has now gathered 336.50 crores* already and is continuing to reaffirm its all-time blockbuster status. Now as per early trends coming in, the film has earned 4-5 crores on the third Wednesday which is day 20. Although the weekday collection looks dwindling, it is expected the film will pick up once again on the weekend."
"So to preface, i actually did greatly enjoy the first movie, as well as this one. I went into the theatre expecting basically what i got. A visual effects movie (lets be honest its an animated movie) with a pretty bland plot and some pretty ok ish acting with some good acting mixed in. So lets begin with the story.Overall, its exactly the same as the first one. Outsider gets adopted by the local natives and is forced to learn their ways to survive. Main character gets bullied and hazed by the other locals because they aren't one of them (in this case it happens to multiple members of the Sully clan), meanwhile big bad military man is working to try to find and push out/ kill main characters. Humans are looking for wonder material and savaging the local ecosystem to get it, killing one of the major spiritual icons to the people.Honestly I was pretty disappointed with the lack of creativity when it came to the writing. It really felt like they didn't hire a writing team and just used the first script and tweaked some things.The characters are actually pretty decent especially Jake since he shows alot of growth in the time between the first movie and the second as well as a good amount of character arc during the movie. I also liked Sigourney weavers character other than the fact she was played by a 70 some year old woman. I thought it was a very peculiar choice to have her played by Weaver and not a younger actress. I really dont think anything would have been lost if they had casted a different actress.The character of Spider on the other hand I was not a huge fan of. This was mostly due to the writing and not the acting. Spider had been raised by the Na'avi for his entire life essentially so you would think that after he is captured he would resist more and do his best to not volunteer information. However, after Quaritch brings him along on their mission, he immediately begins offering valuable information and even teaching them how to speak the language better .In addition to this, later on in the movie, Neytiri holds a knife to his throat to try to manipulate Quaritch into releasing one of her children. After she had just lost one child and was in danger of losing another, i dont think this is bad writing, I do, however, think its bad writing for it to NEVER BE ADDRESSED AGAIN BY HER OR SPIDER!!! It really is just completely ignored afterwards like nothing happened.I also really hated the fact they just brought the same villain back from the dead, not to mention in such a lazy way. The mind back up was never even elluded to in the first movie and it really feels like the lazy way out of trying to creat conflict. Instead of bringing Quaritch back, they really should have made the new General they introduce be a close personal friend, mentor or even student of Quaritch. That way there would still be a personal grudge, but not in such a lazy way.Now, the positives. Like i said, Jake is very well written in this one (if not that well acted) and I appreciate the role he's picked up as the childrens father. I think the idea of him being very strict and more military is good, but it does get a little cringe when he tells them to fall in and all that type of thing.The visuals of this movie are absolutely drop dead gorgeous, by far the best ever put to screen. Normally, a full hour of scenes of just training and shots of mundane things happening in a movie would get tedious but on the contrary, this part in particular went by in a flash and really made the movie feel way shorter than it actually was. I cannot give the visual effects team enough credit for this.I also enjoyed the water people alot. Their Pacific Islander aesthetic is pretty neat, if a little on the nose. The newly created creatures they use are pretty cool too, and very believable for the setting.TLDR: Great visuals, mediocre at best writing, big plot holes, but some pretty decent characters and the great world design make for an enjoyable if flawed movie. Would recommend."
"I had high hopes for this movie. I was not dissapointed! Wisually beautiful and the sound/music was just perfect. I really felt like i knew the caracters and i was never bored while watching this piece. You can easily get bored wathing a 3 hour long movie, but not with this one. I appreciate the fact that they build on the same characters from the previous movie. To me it looks like the produsers and director put a lot of work in to details in the story and pictures. The movie was touching but also funny at times. Surely it was a balance of action, romance, comedy, tragedie, and drama.All in all i would gladly watch it again."
"If you have not done so already, go see this movie, and see it on the big screen.I need to get that out of the way if you don't want to read the whole review.Now, I have seen people describing the movie as overly long or looking down on the simplicity of the plot. They tend to agree it's beautiful.But if reading such reviews you are left with the impression it's a movie you would watch just for the scenery, that the movie is just style and no substance, well, I think you would be left with the wrong impression.The movie takes its time to really show its characters interact with and adapt to the environment around them. It helps us as the viewer connect with the world more, but also understand the characters better. And while the plot may in some ways be simple, I think this simplicity is a strong point, not a flaw. The plot needed to be simple to not shift the focus from the bigger picture. The movie goes beyond struggles between individuals, it's a clash of worlds, a story of beauty and destruction. And it makes one ponder on the values of humanity and the type of actions we are taking as a species.It's not the novelty of the messages that impresses the viewer, but the masterful way in which they are delivered. They are particularly impactful because the movie gets us attached not so much to characters, but to a philosophy of life. As someone who usually prefers character-driven stories I was surprised at how much I agreed with not developing the characters more. Again, I really believe the focus needed to be somewhere else.I would dwell on it more, and explain why I think so many of the choices fit so beautifully together and work towards the same goal. Yet, I might need to start getting a bit specific and I am trying to keep this spoiler free."
"I didn't expect a giant hollywood blockbuster would have such a tender, smart and unpretentious story.Ofcourse it is a cinematic masterpiece, we all knew that, but in the light of what idiotism hollywood, marvel, DC and all the other fairytale farms are producitng in the last decades i had a hard time going to the cinema to see the new Avatar. For me it's not enough to see insane CGI or to watch fights and explosions for 2 hours.And Ohh boi, how did the water take me in. How much chill and just about right amount of excitement this movie has. I was pleased. Pleased so much that 3 and something hours passed in a second. And in the end i didn't want more. I was just extremly happy with what i experienced. I was sucked into a world which has its own life and i was spectating it with a smile, joy and tears on my face.This film was one of the most pleasant surprise in ages.If you are a fantasy film fan, sit confortably, have a joint if you smoke and just let the water take you."
"Watched it in the cinema twice and thought that the second time I won't like it as much. Turns out I fell in love with Pandora even more. James Cameron took us from the nostalgia we remember from 14 years ago to something even more incredible. The story, the world, the incredible effects and how everything just comes together is pure magic. It's been years since I saw a movie where by the end of it I wanted to go buy another ticket and watch it immediately again. It's emersive, emotional and pure genius. It makes you want more and want to be there and want to know more about the world and characters. And it takes a masterpiece for that to happen."
"The movie is indeed truly beautiful and the visual effects are amazing. The storyline does contain a few twists but the general feeling is that it is too aligned to general superhero movies. Not necessarily bad, but pretty unexciting. But again, the visuals make the movie above average and worth a watch. I'd probably ask for a shortened version before watching it again though. Even as the film runs over three hours, there are holes and unfinished parts that you start wondering about after the movie ended. However, this movie is definitely worth watching and preferably on a cinema to get the most out of all effects."
"I was extremely disappointed... such a shame! Beautiful visually but rubbish storyline. Let's spend a butt load of money on basically the same movie as the first one.I was so excited to watch this as I loved the first one, but in all seriousness Cameron should have left it at the first one.To top it all off he finishes this movie not really going anywhere except back to the drawing board for number 3 to spend a whole heap more money.To reiterate the visuals and special effects are beautiful but that's about it for me.Oh well I won't get those 3 hours back. See you in 2033 for the next one because it will probably take another 11 years."
"Effects are impressive. Good if you're 16 or have the mentality of a 16 year old. If you've seen a movie or two in your life, you'll know how each science ends, who exactly is going to die, and how will the protagonists respond. Also, about half of the movie has no plot, just visual effects, so make sure to pack a lot of patience.The fantasy is really lacking, especially compared to other universes such as Marvel, LOTR, star wars, or, you know what, Rick and Morty. There are like 7 species on this entire stupid planet. One type of bird. 3 and half type of fish. Nothing makes sense anymore.In retrospective, I was sure I loved the first Avatar. This movie reminded me that I didn't, and was probably inception-ed to believe I did."
"The pictures and atmosphere of the movie are stunning and obviously cutting edge technology. But the story is like someone took an american family with their teenagers, including all the typical problems and arguments and clichees, to a different planet and paint them all blue. After Avatar 1, which had a much more intense story-telling, this was very disappointing. Listening to teenagers debating with their parents and tough marine papa trying to teach some military discipline to them, when the whole planet is under attack by the super-stereotyped humans, who exploite everything that comes in their way without a second thought, is a bit too much. At the same time the story simply does not make sense. High-tech aggressive humans fighting aliens with an arsenal of weaponry including bombs while the aliens defend themselves with arrows and yet the outcome is uncertain?! Would be great, if it wasn't so unrealistic.I may watch the next part on my sofa, if at all, but certainly not spend money for it in a cinema."
"Unfortunately this movie does everything too much. Its visually stunning and beautifully done.... But....There is over 1/20 of action scenes, charachters get multiple times lost found and rescued in the same action wcene.Romantic nature like avatar scenes take soooo long, eventhouth i think it looks beautifull it just takes too long.Lastly, im a but sad about the direction of the story, instead of focussing on the beautiful people and story of avatar its main focus is the standard: the bad guy comes back with a bigger army and kidnaps your children.... BORING!So for me big dissapointment, the whole movie could litterally be done in 90 min, and...... there is an opening for another movie....."
"Avatar The Way of Water is a visually stunning film that transports audiences to the breathtaking world of Pandora. From the lush forests and the spectacular oceans to the intricate designs of the Na'vi people and their culture, every frame of this film is a feast for the eyes.The story follows Jake Sully, played by Sam Worthington, as he becomes embroiled in the conflict between the human colonists and the native Na'vi on Pandora. Worthington gives a strong performance as Jake, and the supporting cast, including Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, and Stephen Lang, all give standout performances again.But it's not just the acting that will leave a lasting impression on you. The groundbreaking special effects and 3D technology used in the film make it a true feast for the senses. The attention to detail in every shot is impressive, and the action sequences are breathtaking.Overall, Avatar The Way of Water is a must-see film for anyone looking for a visually stunning and immersive cinematic experience. Its impressive visuals and exciting story will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish."""
"The bad news: don't expect a good story; it is barely enough to make a 10 minute short film, and most of the dialogue is childish.at best.The good news: I have seen the movie in 3D imax, and it is a feast for the eyes. The colorful landscapes and creatures are mesmerizing. At the same time, the actions of the 'bad guys' - human beings in Avatar-form - .clearly refer to how destructive our human race is; not just to the nature around us, but also to people of other cultures.The movie is about 3 hours, but it felt lke just one. Anyway, if you have a chance to see it in 3D Imax, it is more then worth going the extra mile."
"This movie is the major reason you go back to cinema to watch movie. The visual is unbeatably stunning, a feast for your visual. However, the story is not the strength of this movie.James Cameron basically wrote a classic sci-fi fantasy story, which is differ the characters only good or bad, no complicated one. Perhaps because the background culture of the Pandora's inhabitants are primitive tribes hence they are more simple-minded people. This movie is basically a continuation of war between the native and conqueror, force of nature and enhanced technology. No strategy and politics.With the superb CGI technology and breath-taking action scenes, this movie is a spectacular ride despite of the plot. Sometimes you only need a simple story to enjoy the magnificent movie."
"Visuals were amazing. Everything in and under the water was incredible. The story, on the other hand, was no existent.Recycled plot with no character development. A 20 minute scene about a whale. Then a 15 minute scene on whale hunting.The movie could have been over in about 90 minutes.The first was better. While th story wasn't great there it flowed and kept you engaged. The sequel leaves a lot to be desired. They could have done so much more with story lines but stopped short so there was more screen time for visual effects. Typical Hollywood anymore. Lazy writing.It's worth watching in the theater for the affects."
"For the three plus hour runtime, you will be entertained as the characters leap, swim, and dive throughout the spectacular imagery.BUT - when you think of good movies, there is usually an iconic scene or a very quotable line. Unfortunately, this movie has neither. The story is all over the place, and you have to create your own storyline to fill in the missing pieces. Most of the dialogue is predictable and does not move the very thin plot along. It seems like the CGI was done first, and then pieced together to make a story.Visually entertained you will be, remembering this film you will not."
"A beautiful and emotional film with a poorly written script. Some of the most amazing scenes fell short just because of the writing!Jake and the children all have wonderful character arcs, however it felt as though this was missing for Neytiri. As a main character, there was a lack of focus on her, which meant she was not able to evolve over the course of the film.The movie's villain was bland and his motivation was boring, but manages to nevertheless be as unlikable as in the first movie.Also the children have different accents to one another and they are not maintained throughout the film? A very bizarre plot hole.On the whole, a thrilling and exciting film, which was absolutely stunning to watch in 3D."
"I am not a fan of 3D, those stupid glasses are not worth it. Therefore, the IMAX experience is too expensive. This movie is totally worth that, finally being able to enjoy 3D and IMAX. You are literally in Pandora through beautiful 3D effects.Startled more than once by unexpected action scenes. The sound is sublime and comes from all sides.The film is full of dark scenes that are beautifully lit.The number of close-ups has also increased significantly compared to the first Avatar. So much more emotion and non-verbal communication.In short, go see this film in the format it was made for: 3D IMAX."
"Reason for reducing 3 stars
-1 Quiet long and all events happening at once :- The movie starts same as the 1st movie start they learn to ride new creature and adapt with new nature and just on plot building that takes atleast 1 hours which feel good in theaters but you will not find that fond and glamour while watching in tv this is truly meant for cinema movie-2 CGI technical expect :- they said that is movie took a decade to make part two but this movie had cgi just compared to any other marvel movie the goosebumps of making this long and 2 billion dollar budget that's a huge budget so I expected something really big cgi which I have never seen before , but the cgi is just a lil bit better than marvel movies but it took so long and this much budget I think that was my disappointment factor.Recommending:- But I would recommend you to watch this as the facial expressions feel really real and feel like they really hired blue aliens to act in this. I liked the face expressions even my father thought for once that they painted humans face and body blue to act on this movie cause the face expression and emotion felt so common like human emotions-3. Only for big screens:- I don't know wheter this point is right or wrong but I would still try to explain you as much as possible I think you won't like this movie to watch on you home tv until and unless you have 3d tv or home theater system cause the movie has large whale like creature, sealife, big ocean, luminous creature and different thing which you will like only in 3d or big tv which is crystal clear and 4K cause I really loved it then only you would love to watch it twice or thrice personally I watch movie twice in theater in IMAX 3D .I experienced the movie twice in IMAX 3D that why I would say it is experiencing movie which you can watch more than once but only in large and humongous theather or on Tv with atleast 70 inches display and home theater."
"Avatar (2009) paved the way for new motion capture and 3D technology. Avatar: The Way of Water takes the batton and runs with ease. Fortunately, I was able to see this movie in a local XD stadium at 60fps 3D. The high frame rate truly does a lot to add to the immersion and reality of the 3D technology. Within the first few minutes I had completely forgotten that I was wearing 3D glasses and watching a 3D movie. I was fully engrossed and still blown away by the striking visuals and sweeping story. Im excited to see Avatar 3. December 2023 can't come soon enough. I highly reccomend seeing this film in the best stadium possible."
"So the visual performance was great, even though not a lot better than the 1st movie, but there you go.The storyline however was very thin, characters did not evolve much and ran into the same mistakes like seven times (""I will deal with my boy after he did the same thing wrong six times in one month""). Some plot turns were completely random: the whales suddenly have a magical substance which can be sold for a lot of money (okay interesting, new, heard nothing about that before but after the news is published nothing is to be heard anymore about this plot twist, wtf?).Honestly, quite dissapointing. I expected more."
"First of all if you want to watch The way of water in cinema, i highly recommend you to watch it in IMAX. Visually out of this world ( like the first one) , but it also delivers the same effect either, however it is 2022.I dont want to judge other people's opinion, but if somebody tells you that the story/script is boring just finish the conversation with them right there as politely as possible. The Way of Water is about family and their emotional connections with each other and with the Na'vi's environment, which were perfectly shot/captured/presented throughout the whole moovie.The score is impeccable, not to mention The Weeknd's soundtrack during the post credit.The only reason why i didn't give this masterpiece a 10 is ,that i'm very looking forward to the upcoming sequels, where i will want to be blown away by the ending (character improvings, final battle etc..) . I also would be very thankful if Mr. James Cameron won't leave the director chair until the end, because if somebody could fulfill the fans expectations, it's HIM.In summary, if you love cinema, and visually stunning films you have to experience Avatar 2. In IMAX. However it was 13 years ago when the first chapter came out , in my opinion it was completely worth the wait!Best regards,
A fan from Hungary."
"I didn't bother to rewatch the first Avatar. I enjoyed watching it in the cinema in 3D, though. Same here. Very enjoyable to see the next level 3D, but lack of good story makes it a one time show. But this next level 3D is incredible. Most of the action takes place literally on your lap? Add some reverberating seats -that makes your heart pounds out of your chest with each explosion- a recliner, and some pop corn and you're set up for a most memorable experience.The movie started with a fast pace, but then died out and became very slow for more than an hour- the National Geographic portion. Maybe this was intentionally to allow for better appreciation of the 3D effect. When the pace became fast again I could hardly notice the effects.It's all about Cameron in there. He is the director, producer, and writer! He had a team of writers to help. But I think he told them what scenes he wanted to direct. How to put in the story is not his job. He also decided to re-use Titanic set. It's just lying there so why not!"
".... It means you have no feelings. They were taken from you a long time ago...
Excellent movie.💪Complete action cinema, some interesting hidden premises, makes you understand things you don't think about everyday.The film exposes every human emotion, from happiness to anger, from love to hate, from fear to courage.Visually perfect, in IMAX 3D it puts you in your seat.Although very long, I personally think that I got a good portion of entertainment, and I was never bored.I will remember two things from this movie:
1. Killing only leads to killing
2. Happiness is simpleBe sure to watch it, let yourself release every feeling sent by the director to your heart😊👌"
"Awesome effects, great movie. 3d experience 10/10.Story had everything, love and happiness but Also sadness. Family and the more relaxed happy scenes are so genuine, and the war scenes are grim but obviously very cool with the colossal effects of the weapons and stuff exploding etc. The physics and everything in 3d makes you feel like you're in another world and everything feels very real and affects you on a deep level.Great acting and i still don't understand how they managed to edit this so good, the sound effects is also on point. Cast did an incredible job!Would recommend seeing this in 3d because you are really experiencing everything in a different way, like you're litterally in the avatar world without any distractions so you get into the movie and really."
"Sometimes you just leave the cinema and know it was something special. Avatar is a special movie. We all know that nothing is perfect, not even James Cameron, but the feeling and 3D spectacle I got and felt after the movie were very close to that. I highly recommend it. Also, it makes you think about humanity as a race.Are we the good guys? Maybe not so much after all.You could say we Humas are terrible.It gives you both tears and joy.This film is best experienced in a theater, in IMAX 3D.At the end of the movie, you know that the art and technology of motion-picture photography have leveled up once again."
"First of all, Movie looks insanely good as expected. Totally Worth to see it at least once. Side plots was kind of interesting, like how Grace daughter can control Eva or something. 1st part of the movie was great, streight to the action. Humans return, Blue cat's fights back. And i like Jake and Naitiri, they seem like a good teamI would give this a 6.5/10Now, what i didn't like, as this is more important. This is personal opinion though.Main story feels like Written by 5 year old. Seriously.If Jake run away, why they chase him? He pose no threat anymore. When he knew that soldiers are chasing him, why he didn't done anything to prepare? Where was Water people when the ship crashed? Humans got wrecked with full military in a first movie, now they come with a fishing boat?Basically it's a first movie, just scaled down. If you would jump from 1st one to 3rd one, you wouldn't miss much.Honestly, i am SO confused, how does Cameron planning to make 5 movies out of this one? There is no Lore whatsoever. There was no hooks of a story. There is no main bad guy besides ""Humans"", so How? Are war against Humans gonna last for 4 more movies, when they beat them up in the first one?And Oh boy, The Biggest Sin is a ""Villains"" of the movie... More Generic Villains i can't even imagine. They are humans - Greedy. They are soldiers - they kill stuff, no motivation, nothing. And how do you show that they are soldiers? That's right, you put those HIDIOUS sunglasses on fking Avatar. WHY?"
"In terms of cinematography, sound, visuals and design this movie is superb. Partly due to its lengthiness however I found myself bored a couple times throughout the movie, mainly in the middle.At the start and in the end it is very action packed but the whole middle segment sometimes felt like filler time.Some of the story moments actually managed to make me feel some sadness which I don't often experience in a movie. Gives a good representation of it's immersiveness.Nonetheless I grealy enjoyed the immersive experience, the action scenes and the story, although the latter could've also been deeper in my opinion."
