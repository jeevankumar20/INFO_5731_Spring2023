alfred hitchcock famously said make great film need three thing script script script convinced james didnt shooting script turned camera filmed motion capture put insane amount cgithe character devoid emotion motive charisma giving personality plank wood empty vessel james use megaphone spread environmental concern honestly make documentary like blue planet call day dozen year case waste much audience time money say thing thats said multiple time much better way looking wallethe story simple predictable yet still couldve worked runtime bee shorter like lot shorter could cut hour half wouldnt make slightest difference term continuity scene ended kept going minute sub plot quality soap operaand last dialogue movie day dont seem care good dialogue sadly audience dont seem care either dialogue firstly importantly interesting exposition escalation driving plot forward useless instrument audience isnt invested character saying whole movie feel like written pretentious art student knowledge interactive speaking work also doesnt help actor terrible delivering line without emotion charisma sound like character bad video game
watched movie imax one best cinematic experience long time movie look absolutely stunning time couldnt tell cgi wasnt thats real look every piece scenery something admire visuals might groundbreaking back still best seen movie cameron expertly crafted world immerse ini also enjoyed story following formular seen first one er could recognize story piece medium new character great well really enjoyed exploring world end movie also became obvious still movie go doesnt quite feel like conclusion solution set upi dont know better first movie see cinematic event want watch movie watch theater watching home give full experience trust
movie defintely worth watch visuals movie absolutely stunning much actually tend forget incredible watching since masterfully done throughouti rewatched first avatar day went see one even though obvious change made story universe isnt done much consequense overall experience good therethe real criticism give regarding storyplot lack thereof first movie extremely simple unoriginal story least one avatar way water seamingly plot considerable storyline set mainly show visual superiority make seem bit hollow naturally shame still recommend movie visuals delightful reunion universe pandora
say worth seeing movie big screen visually magnificent couldnt take eye watching possibly best movie ever seen visually come butbut movie excels visually come short storyplot felt bit repetitive similar way first avatar movieit felt james camerons main focus making near perfect movie visually unfortunately negative impact plot overall gave movie real unbalanced feel hope avatar bring stronger storyplot make unpredictable enjoyableone final point make feel need sigourney weaver play voice daughter still child everytime spoke didnt come across right child talking like year old woman benefit get seriously strange decision female child character cast child actress simple
biggest thing came movie story worried exactly would continue story naturally keep audience interested well think story able also still think mightve needed edits make bit better enjoyed family element movie obviously first movie one inevitable jake neytiri would family really enjoyed getting see connected family showing different dynamic well felt like real family sibling would stand one second next make fun due many new character movie important thing balance movie new character introduce audience build connection important give enough time develop show dynamic character although would love say movie good job balancing character cant say fully come kid character particular story good job spending time depending important come character movie time forgot even existed due little screen time get see movie jake neytiri werent shown much one character particular surprised didnt get much screen timespider played jack champion despite interesting character didnt get much screen time disappointing much potential really interesting character study end forgotten along way wasnt new character tossed side also lot metkayinas also pushed side feel like came pushing character side primarily affected water tribe none character fully fleshed many ended flat character really hope future movie get screen time proper static character think biggest reason character arent part sully family get pushed side due part story didnt really enjoy sky people returning im returning kind figured going return choose return particular decided quaritch played stephen lang return big bad movie applaud movie actually addressing possible despite making zero sense wish created new bad guy movie wasnt problem sky people storyline didnt feel fully thought two different storyline going sky people one randomly forgotten one literally appearing nowhere see idea wish adjusted bit make bit interesting also time movie feel like come screeching halt overall pacing movie surprisingly well done didnt notice much time passed one biggest concern threehourlong run time thinking going scene couldve cut shortened partially correctfor part never felt like movie dragging moving decent pace especially opening scene reintroduced character sully family start feel pacing issue sky people return family go pandora reef point movie started find scene couldve cut cut find funniest thing though movie despite everything flowing well ending movie rushed ending best described dont blink youll miss due fast go think real biggest reason dont notice much time passed due special effect movie despite many year passed since first avatar movie came there one thing everybody agree special effect aged super well specifically love compare motion capture first movie one sure see difference cgi navi creature pandora everything look much cleaner natural especially true come look creature pandora getting properly explore reef pandora get see new creature mainly inhabit ocean im asking ride ilu skimwing tulkun welldesigned creature look incredible people creature jawdropping environment pandora well weve already seen forest pandora look like exciting getting see whole area gorgeous every scene thats underwater breathtaking make wish could go visit place definitely huge round applause every single special effect crew person hard work creating underwater creature environment navi people course without actor motion capture suit none would work outi cant say acting movie best say kid movie really stole show teenage actor movie first big movie role really doesnt show able convey proper emotion thats needed scene make character stand amongst others sibling able likely relate one sulley sibling due well demonstrate different kind sibling everybody person surprise trinity joli bliss play tuk expected tuk cliche annoying little sibling actually fun watch say youngest relate person related really enjoyed watching loak portrayed britain dalton sully kid loak honestly interesting watch due part britain dalton portrayal character conveyed perfectly kid who trying best fit others family still true always stand belief despite everything always sibling protect anything despite much screen time another actor surprised jack champion like said earlier spider interesting character study he human raised among navi feel like screen time jack champion could really bring much character make fan favourite remember looking cast list seeing sigourney weaver play kiri coming back movie curious see well sigourney weaver incredible job playing teenage daughter grace know part cgi looked completely different still couldnt tell playing character thought brought young actress motion capture voice work nosigourney weaver actually played kiri physicality vocal tell put effort come across regular teenage actor voice body posture conveys emotion well quickly say despite lot screen time zoe saldana also pretty good every time zoe saldana screen saw neytiris character growth past year becoming mother changed shes super supportive family want whats best also brings raw emotion character well youre hypnotized performance everybody else movie also pretty good due many getting much screen time couldnt fully show acting ability last thing want mention editing movie weird part editing movie fine occasion editing weird there one scene one thing happening randomly cut something else related couple second cutting back original thing moment taken movie experience decently confused end avatar way water surprised also proved right still issue story movie definitely worth seeing least whatever specialized screen local theatre special effect alone im curious see happen avatar
cgi underwater scene excellent perfectionism something cameron finally movie cinema make sense completely new experience new standard coming movie future innovation qualifies top ratinghowever story predictable quite boring film intended broad audience banal simplified message pocahontas premature adult cartoon movie hoped something advanced saving whale sustainability general brainier alabama man wont change mind watching movie anyways

first big fan avatar blown away cgi back revolution term cgi movie avatar way water disappoint far go phenomenal probably beautiful movie ever seen detail remarkable felt surreal experiencing dbut cameron forget spend time plot seems like spend time cgi reused plot avatar sky people returned want populate earth guess main villain colonel quaritch course resurrects new blue version determined get revenge motivation throughout whole movie track jake sully kill matter immortal dy might well make new avatar himonce jake must learn adapt new way life case reef people time big family eg two brother impossible distinguish introduced big resource movie stuff brain tulkun stop ageing process unobtanium vol reef people hear killing tulkuns decide participate war quaritch sky people great job fighting people boat sudden reef people gone suddenly jake neytiri kid apparently reef people went home seems like huge plot hole since jake could easily defeat quaritch rest men reef people stayed foughti liked fighting scene jake quaritch maybe little long great suspense end fight avatar rescued eywa spider fun character decides save quaritch even though experienced horrible immediately go sully family hug jake part group make sense love family much save colonel tried kill seems hard writer come new villain following movie keep alive big question also villain avatar short plot similar avatar quite plot hole however visual part movie insane must watch cinema
astonishingly beautiful watch far better avatar specially sea stuff kudos cameron thatspoiler alert time sequel known pretty much similar original cant believe even reciled villain sounded lazy let copy paste story add sea bit titanic loss family member dont get wrong loved watching specially imax could hardly believe eye beautiful really frustrating felt like waste time money spend hour basically story screen even hate towards human oops whole manicheism mankind mean sky people bad want use earth mean pandora natural resource feel kinda stupidthere many way show mankind overly using earth natural resource making binary good v bad story actually doesnt help people wont reflect itanyway ill likely watch visuals want nice story though stick st hope one doesnt make much money st id hate pay visuals even worse story
dont understand movie epic proportion exorbitant amount financing fails greatly storytellinghow get overlookedthe writing dialogue cringe cringe cringei almost threw mouth timesyes scenery beautiful special effect quote unquote world care deep connection character get boring real fastit snooze fest yes pricey nap screeningso unfortunatewhy big name director get lazy maybe wrapped big toysso disappointingkate winslet ronal despite brilliant always still didnt feel character absolute barometersome acting though cringe melodramatic disconnectedthis given visuals
everything looked similar last movie cgi animation dialogue action sequence literally copy pasted first movie zero originality clear james cameron cash standard even terminator widely praised audience wasnt really good terminator easy see rehash wasnt goodthis movie didnt really need sequel first ended well sequel would human coming back force annihilating navi happened instead seeing new human force attack navi basically got revengewhale hunt plot quaritch subplot needed ended last film he reduced cartoonish villain im even kidding first movie quaritch company man looking profit expense native free reign go jake sully expense earth employer wutwe know james camerons obsession deep sea submersible diving painful see shoehorn avatar story unbelievable way dont want make spoiler end movie left bad taste mouth writing wasnt good movieplease wait streaming worth watching theater trust

watched first avatar many time huge anticipation one honestly surprised sad contrast first one also sad moment still quite upbeat tone ended victory note one hard enjoy fully overall quite emotionally draining necessarily bad thing modern movie completely emotionally sterile personally stoic person even barely held together end woman around wiping tear glass brutalin regard world buildup cinematography action scene usual james cameron delivers overdelivers wish indepth self exploration feeling main character little poetic selfobservation jake sully go first movie emotion reaction mostly basic primal response happening much fear anger uncertainty also little wonderful personality neytiry one pushed close primal instinct emotion think shouldve quiet happy moment contrast ugliness threat coming human invasion barely saw life jake sully pandora first movie scene enough overall feel like first part twopart movie hope next one get released sooner dont wait year

used confess mr camerons biggest fan sentiment ended way water way water good story latest installment avatar reminds poor sequel followed terminator sure mr cameron actually took part movie production one thing sure missing james cameron touch fell love year thought provoking dialogue decision made villain completely unrealistic scene dilogue disjointed ending titanic remade infact whole movie remake st one maritime perspective character like stupid boy spider completely stupid spirituality st installment replaced cursing urban gesturing father relationship dont make sense could go bottom line movie big disappointment worthy wasting time money

basically retelling first movie jake sully kid neytiri u marine still attacking pandora made look like nazi water navi live ocean could made look cooler lighter blue skin tone even sea creature look bland coloranother thing bother movie navi use marine weapon thought navi using kind weaponry doesnt jive belief apparently war monger like marinesthis movie extremely boring way long hour james cameron never made train wreck trying compete star war star trek completely missed mark force wasnt made thisedit effect groundbreaking average compared cgi effect shouldnt make movie story character also everything take place planet extremely boring least star war star trek multiple planet specie shown james cameron trying make buck couldnt care le storytelling character development obvious anyone isnt completely brainwashed special effect

left wanting even though control p interval break multiplex witnessing cinematic marvel believe extra adrenaline rushing action sequence last hour making somehow uncomfortable funny way 😂😂😂yes hour lengthy run time year wait james cameron knew nothing le would justice fan first part dont think adding anything new say cinematic masterpiece real world may start look little dull even living kashmir lot said every word praise coming anybody well deserved onehowever feel version could little better expecting arrow shot neytri flying screen hitting invader something enjoyed first part yes rain spectacular diving sessionthis sequel revenge hurt ego thrashed invader kind expecting kind storytelling anything different would looked completely hook although little predictable completely thrilling definitely leave wanting
read somewhere james cameron best director come visuals technique well seeing avatar di say amazing beautiful movie ever seeni wonder people see since ish peep looking imax theater movie meant watched dstory wellokit goodyes good imo good original avatar movieone story something building lucky see movie iti wait let build likingthis bit light forseeable go plotwise good stillwhat come tech visuals effectsthat alone would give movie like point possiblewere navis one invented navigator reptile life pandoratip drop imax etcgo watch promise wont regretthis one need seen glass amen
vfx story length movieinitial part go thru well sometimes start dragging endlessly many people movie theater seen moving around sometime particularly interval predictable world flying vehicle technologygunsfire everything look amazing vfxits big torture sit watch movie sometime becomes predictable length movie big let downmovie ticket movie exorbitantly high surprise collected much money box office
movie dumb enjoyable actually think story little stronger first movie although pretty painfully obvious james cameron dragged setting area he comfortable underwater he pulled tool bag liberally using aspect abyss titanic alien deep etcno complaint casting really character least depth believability although character plot induced stupidity one particular one telegraphed quite earned guess interaction character question scripted cute due long running timeonly saw going see imax xmas might end mindblowing like first one visually
great movie bit long thoroughly enjoyed visuals stunning course particularly enjoyed watching sully family adapting new environment even seeing inspiration maori culture water people cool see awe whole time felt though could relate kiri sense overwhelmed beauty environment highly regarded ecosystem pandorahowever even though know film isnt real cruelty shown movie felt bit real really disturbed doesnt impact rate film people really cannot watch film animal cruelty distressed environmental harm say hard watch time still recommend though
avatar way water build cameron successfully deployed first film incredible visuals mediocre plot tag along behindthis film essentially film three time first act kid end captured saved happens second last act wellthe design native naavi incredible creature fantastic even seem thought evolution animal clearly shared similar natural lineage detail design make avatar film popular however also design choice film kiri teenager film adopted jake neytiri kiri somehow fatherless child sigourney weaver character first film dr grace naturally choose play kiri however weaver isnt teenager real life actually happens year old woman naturally deep voice didnt work although liked kiri character weaver performance really jarred mealso character spider awful actorapart great watch
long awaited sequel highest grossing film time finally arrived great saw film imax one best overwhelming experience ever everything james cameron first film technically whole different caliber primary issue one original avatar story bad surface level im saying story complex come film clear case style substance avatar way water absolutely worth wait hopefully take james cameron long make next one
okay much waiting disappointed certainly image beautiful make animated film actor film still supporting human make differencethe storyline isflat best lot inconsistency train attack dont know came going since human base train carrying weapon aircraft cockpit cross arrow attacker around thirty big battle flying fish disappear fight middle child constantly disobedient middle fight without scratch except one dy make said lot story hole inconsistency year feel like script done three day there nothing attachment character even jack coward good family man im even talking writer bringing back bad colonel introducing son sigourneys daughter clone surviving second filmin short apart computergenerated image longer represent tour de force today since film becomes indigestible prefer forget number following one dont think success bad
avatar way water james cameron prof he best action director film innovator one still relevant year amazing film makingvisually movie stunning manages innovate cgi flawless especially considering difficulty everything involving water entire moviei really like sigourney weaver young character probably favorite character way cameron found good way bring back character died first moviei would say weakest point movie plot partially rehash first movie running time dont feel like watching movie hour long still bit shorter final battle felt like dragging bit muchthis movie easily win academy award visual effect there justice give cameron oscar direction taken first moviei watched movie stunning couldnt tell part changed hfr flawlessi give movie visuals rest go watch big screen hfr

say excited movie understatement although first avatar massively popular released time people critical film opinion never really changed avatar isnt greatest movie ever certainly worst deserves credit pocahontas blue people cant say sequel truly disappointmentwe left first movie quaritch dead military expelled pandora jake permanently transferred avatar body sequel couldve gone many route instead james cameron chooses probably least imaginative path travel year pas quaritch back conveniently avatar form hellbent vengeance jake sully nothing else motivates action even matter quaritch dad side note jake sole focus he happy spend fair bit military resource get revengemeanwhile jake playing family man leader clan facing arrival new human militia pandora hears quaritch back decides escape sea different navi clan resides follows almost three hour following sully family sea mostly gorgeous visuals empty storytelling plot point clearly setup many sequel already work jakes adopted daughter inexplicable power son befriends basically whale movie spends fair bit time showing viewer hunting animal badnot jake reflect fact human movie never discus internal conflict may arise since jake fighting human part relationship neytiri also barely visited zoe saldana criminally underutilised reduced simply shouting cry majority linesthe movie forgets human v navi conflict doubt happening forest area pandora glaze fact there new resource town coveted power make human immortal genuinely mentioned throwaway comment instead stuck fight jake quaritch build lacklustre finale make realise smallscale movie even mil budgetwhilst shot truly beautiful three hour sea youll likely wish back forest experiencing weird wacky wonder filmmaker previously thought pandoraall movie worth wait itll long time watch james camerons name likely would rated much lowerthe master sequel dropped ball here hoping next sequel better

come james cameron bar definitely high make easy disappoint way im saying avatar terrible movie however mediocre experienceto sum terribly boring villain nothing better story overall kinda feel like recycled time often nothing made interested part three even great water visuals didnt change meand yes enjoyed first avatar wouldnt say mindblowing story worked well new time amazing probably still hold wellthe sequel hand seemed cameron interested depicting live water everything around kind felt like mixing together various story character idea previous moviesalso im fan mixing fps fps movie lot computer animation feel lot like video game day visually improved lot past year dont get wrong water segment movie visually amazing aside fps matter taste course alone wasnt enough enjoy movie long would preferred shorter compact movie caseso yeah difficult recommend movie younger audience might work better able fully enjoy experience dont get hung storytelling still think one camerons weakest movie narrative level

storyline extremely shallow predictable actually wasnt even real story honest dialogue empty sounded like written teenager character one dimensional acted way would make feel frustrated couldnt help roll eye good thing film visual effect even got oldboring pretty everything looked element novelty surprise hour way long considering zero development story charactersi watched imax felt like waste time money several part almost fell asleep

great experience cgi stunning honestly plot wasnt even terrible flaw overall worked well imo movie felt like bridge third movie acted mainly device build expand pandora rather telling brand new story theme well explored touching topic like animism gnosticism reflecting real world environmental issue human created earth fascination adoration nature spiritual connection beautifully portrayed came ocean soul eventually return death
scorsese right movie like cinema exactly something else buy ticket seat move action something else like imagine interactive novel surround sound ambient sound effect piped scent match readits longer literature something elsethis ride sensory experience cinema feel like long disneyworld attraction movie frame rate change distracting alternating smooth soap opera high def video occasionally looking actually filmic realisticunlike say seventh seal godfather story character could adequately summarized sentence two little finer resolution required one could make argument first star war supposebut telling simple story epic way doesnt necessarily diminish piece case story character much archetype star war thin shallow perfunctory generic ultimately devoid necessary compelling relatabilitystar war thin sure archetype story classic universal somehow relatable human way avatar isntthis ride without moving seat though certainly worth price admission lasting effect precisely long deep feeling one left exiting disney attraction fun last evaporates get line next ride

unpopular opinion easily worst james cameron movie recent memory me😂 pretty animation visual spectacle sure unbelievably bloated littered questionable choice enjoy movie would require one throw logic window despite long runtime coherent plot character development still virtually nonexistentwhen said done hour life never get backon positive note come dvd id definitely recommend playing background house party drink every time one kid say bro youre gonna lot fun passing drunk time movie youre welcome 😁

like many went high expectation given wonderful first movie bar set pretty high ill keep short sweet avoid giving sort spoiler opinion breathtaking storyline scenerycgi character old new everything gelled theme pertinent relevant current world issueschallenges perhaps thats pack emotional punch im glad took time show amazing cinema dont rush much stuff rushed studio cash another testament good movie wife didnt glance phone whole three hour

loud common reaction heard leaving cinema auditorium fellow viewer wow didnt feel long fact almost quick considering fact movie mean quick big testimony riveting captivating movie plot visuals combined im saying beginning review wont discussing visuals simply cant add thing whats said alreadythe point want make regard plot much better reviewer claim character heard say movie much like first installment people saying spoke fault simply outcome single story continued first installment think another chapter read book dont expect every chapter turn story upsidedown fact youd complaining would case thing cameron already done installment terminator ii see two realize single movie separated two chapter thats reason cameron didnt want anything rd installment terminator went point story making make destiny strong enough dont know yet whats point time im sure weve seen end story im definitely going wait watch next installment create amazing complete world mind always love artist creates entire world storyas character created movie unlike first one significant character left undeveloped could use substance obviously movie would end even longer accordingly acting first class though im still uncertain regarding fact sigourney weaver playing year old daughter understand point cameron making flawlessly im still bit uneasy thing movie thing cameron left story spoke little major issue already said movie long enough still detail missing story completely coherent
watched avatar imax year ago thoroughly moved imagery world character story facilitated emotion blind approach went movie real idea took similar approach movie tooi dazzled true imax could bring life visual brilliance movie brought world character life story lacked depthit mostly contained lot platitude family way water whole lot action meaningful underlying message eat eaten certain point felt like fast furious series wondrous landscape pandora could beenvisually stunning kudos people made happen fire writer twice essentially dishing meaningless story focused platitude character formation suspenseful twist anything could made movie good first one
thank continuing movie abandoning happening movie take viewer another marvelous field vision hope continue make progress making movie available audience like television anymore want make k k another world film made long focused family able cut lot footage great success focusing taking care aquatic animal ecology destroyed world bad world policy nature follows course already warning u snowfall pole
start ok visuals special effect nothing short amazing however cared visuals stick natural geographic story pretty lame happens isnt really problem script actual telling story whole first half movie summarizing end first movie new story insanely unnecessarythe way wasnt good saying first movie amazing better told better plot nothing really happened fighting started said could see maybe first part bigger story come later like one filler episode tv series good part honestly like filler episode never want rewatch
let honest avatar dance wolf space visuals amazing story terrible predictable isnt better honestly muchvisual spectacle nothing new film today seethe le impact see towering jungle underwater reefsand floating mountain brain becomes numbto whole thing fed cake morning noon night always going get sick eventuallythe whole family angst teen drama junk went minuteshow one recalled event first film completely destroyed tree first one one seems recall thatthe cliche human v navii contrite tired noble savage trope dont enough trope already film tv right nowjames need stop writing film actually suck writing technical side amazing stick thatas critical drinker saidi struggle decide whether recommend film people hour shorter maybe bit smarter nuanced would nobrainer stand even though better almost anything else put disney year long bloated selfindulgent really dont know worth time money early box office result anything go might one
remember completely entranced first avatar ive fan every work cameron released he much storyteller he inventor he paved way many movie effect set standard hollywood elite lately never hope meet im glad finally able release second movie since movie industry crisis consistently faced mediocre work mostly bad sequel original content cameron worked miracle amount detail effort put avatar mind blowing hear lot steam whiner internet blast havent even seen fool cameron doesnt direct steer put blood sweat tear every project he greatest filmmaker ever lived truly hope get content year im really looking forward sequelsand side note love sigourney weaver favorite actress incorporated back movie fantastic
avatar one would think three hour violent war film whaling whaling scene unnecessary harpooning mother whale calf following whale dead calf seen nudging dead mother film distasteful disturbing ridiculous visual stunning thats avatar already filmed set released anything like sincerely hope cameron reconsiders tone need pulled exactly take three year make
visuals great often time videogameisque otherwise story shallow childishcant wrap head around important part werent given enough importance yeah leave forest tribe save as let send someone earth chase single guy space reason etc yet hour spent showing unnecessary visuals character boring dont feel bonding dialogue childish dont give feeling good writing get boring often time thingsanother annoying part hfr seemed coming going wasnt present whole movie make difficult get used hfr cinema fpstbh disappointment except nice visuals
goodness even though went movie without expectation really bad first two half hour boooooooooing silly none sense talk finally get last minute pure stupid action story begin unless want consider revenge main plot story basically point whole movie felt like watching soap opera blue people furthermore every scene predicable silly dialogue cant say much acting whole movie visual affect even action scene silly lame bottom line dont waste neither money time
basic story line ive seen little addition first movie standard miller american family blue face paint special effect good movie lacked creativity would recommend watching thisit lacked alien feel exploration new world new technology new science first movie sure wait needed better story worse cgi etc would much better everything need blockbuster budget blockbuster hopefully making another ilk

really hate say plot ruined experience could great movie creating stunning visuals showing create throw absurd amount money vfx doesnt make good moviefor show visual effect stunning groundbreaking may online play supporting role storytelling making main element movie result least underwhelming experiencewithout story simply get compilation really great super realistic vfx shot stretched minute maybe cameron could planned two sequel instead four focused plot developement much like hobbit movie movie feel like butter put much bread
thing made way water le satisfying original imo first effect disappointing cant remember exactly first second thing focus jarring way like spear arrow tip coming screen looked directly instead character face looked multiple place looked somewhere focal point screen thing looked badsecond quite bit spoon feeding dialogue defeating purpose avatar joining able talk directly sea creaturesthirdly rare material switch also surprisingly low value funny like maybe million massive amount movie started production youd need kill thousand whale get billion seems tall orderfinally whole story end worse position first avatar send human packing time theyve partially defeated old villain backup generally think new villain wouldve better lot thing couldve cut without affecting plot like relationship whale already established empathy nature first
except dont imagine happening everyday one care let little something world better place sureand let kill earth save earth save humanity take away got amazingly well done filmbeautiful visual touching story marvelous technology deep thoughtful message alarming warning let give hand jamesi almost cried felt guilty anything stop current way trading nature film everyone watch old young maybe one day unite earth nature
movie satisfies expectation far visual beauty movie lively filmed directly fandora felt like watching natural documentary animal movement natural making seem like took picture actual animal long wait worth however regret noticeable abroad element also disadvantage movie unnecessarily long development delayed much defending audience boring also really regrettable narrative plot simple enough write one line confrontation structure also simpler previous oneand middle movie mentioned migration goal human focusing peripheral content definitely prepared followuplets keep eye
